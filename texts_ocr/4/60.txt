2.5.6 Communications and engagement of passengers

Communication activities increased again in 2019, in line with the overall
development of company activities. The main object of assessment was the role of
the airport in relation to the local area and to stakeholders, strengthening the
corporate media image and supporting the engagement and corporate identity of
employees and the airport community.

Over the years, Bologna Airport has introduced and managed a wide range of CARE
communications tools, from the most traditional (e.g. brochures, press releases,

newsletters, monitors at the terminal) to the most modern and interactive (e.g. social channels, app, website,
chatbot, beacon). The trend towards the use of new communication channels, such as the Internet and
social media, continued in 2019.

The overall perception of the efficacy and accessibility of public information services was also very positive.
In 2019, Bologna Airport continued to expand communications tools in relation to passengers, with both
CRM targeted information and remote information points. Satisfaction was particularly high for operational
information points, internal signage and the website.

 

In late 2019, the Company launched a multi-subject, multi-channel advertising campaign, which continued in
early 2020. The objective of the campaign was to draw attention to AdB’s present and future work on
Sustainable Development, and simultaneously highlight the positive effect this work is having on the area in
which the airport operates. The campaign included six topics, grouped under the common payoff “The world
is an open door’. These were: Sustainability, Economic Impact, Tourism, Innovation, Human Resources and
Destinations. During the holiday period, a seventh was added which centred around Christmas.

The campaign was conducted through local (and, to a lesser extent, national) newspapers, the airport's
Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles, its website, the SIE” monitors in the airport, and a large billboard in
central Bologna (piazza Galvani).

Involvement of institutions

As an important actor in a complex regional context, it is essential that AdB works in synergy with national
and international institutions for the development of passenger services and as an active participant in the
growth of the local area and community. Accordingly, the airport promotes not only initiatives relating to the
management of airport activities, but also a range of other actions with social and environmental impact.

Local institutions play a key role, both as actors and as partners in pursuing the strategic goal of making the
airport increasingly sustainable for the local area and community. For example, for the management of noise
impacts, a technical working group has been established between AGB and representatives of the main local
authorities, including the Municipality of Bologna, the Regional Environment and Energy Agency (ARPAE)
and the Municipality of Calderara di Reno, with the aim of coordinating relations with citizens, developing
monitoring activities and ensuring a systematic exchange of information. In addition, as a major strategic
infrastructure facility, AdB also participates in the Municipality of Bologna’s Sustainable Energy Action Plan,
aimed at appropriately supporting the pursuit of the shared goals of cutting climate-altering emissions.
