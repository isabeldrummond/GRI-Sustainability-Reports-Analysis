2.6.1 Noise management

The Group pays particular attention to noise pollution, since it is the most critical environmental issue
affecting the local area. In order to minimise the impact of noise pollution, the company’s environmental
policy is based around continuous noise monitoring, identification of mitigation measures, dialogue with the
local community and communications transparency. AdB has always strived to build dialogue and
cooperation with local authorities through a dedicated airport noise working group. Carrying forward its work
through 2018, the group is coordinated by the Municipality of Bologna, and comprises representatives from
the local municipal administrations, the Regional Agency for Prevention, the Environment and Energy
(ARPAE) and the local health authority (ASL). The activity of the working group is focused on a shared
assessment of noise pollution issues affecting local residential areas, the management of complaints from
citizens, the identification and planning of mitigation and noise compensation actions. Efforts are also made
to improve airport noise mitigation procedures by the Airport Commission, established by Ministerial Decree
31/10/1997, and chaired by the Civil Aviation Authority ENAC.

IRESA

As of January 1, 2020, the Region of Emilia-Romagna has applied IRESA (Regional Tax on Aircraft ON
Noise Emissions) as a specifically targeted levy. Income from the tax will be allocated to the

completion of the acoustic monitoring system and acoustic anti-pollution, in addition to further QZ
investments and/or indemnities for the residents in zones A and B in the airport’s surrounding

area, as defined by the Environmental Ministry Decree of October 31, 1997. IRESA must be paid by

airlines, and is applied to every take-off and landing movement. It is calculated on the basis of each aircraft's noise
certificate, whether the movement takes place during the day or night, the type of propulsion (propeller or jet), and the
direction of take-off or landing. this latter parameter for application of the levy — particularly complex and not currently
available to the airport manager — is still being defined and requires a subsequent motion of the Regional Council. The
tariff decreases as aircraft acoustic performance increases, and in line with the take-off or landing slot
(daytime or night-time). In 2019, the Parent Company (and also, for General Aviation, the subsidiary TAG) began
implementation of the communication systems and procedures for payment and collection of this new levy on behalf
of the Region. Since January 1, 2020, the Group has calculated, invoiced and collected IRESA from airlines, and
periodically forwards these payments to the Region of Emilia-Romagna, which receives both the revenues and the
supporting information flows.

Airport noise management activities are based, first of all, on the continuous assessment of noise impacts
through the airport noise monitoring system. The system determines noise levels on the ground by
integrating data from noise monitoring units and radar, indicating the routes of aircraft landing and taking off.
The system produces a significant amount of data, which is processed, made available to citizens and the
local community, and used to identify improvement measures.

One of the most critical noise impact issues is the disturbance caused to people residing in overflown areas.
This is why one of the fundamental elements of the mitigation process is dialogue with citizen and committee
representatives. In addition, the company’s Action Plan, identifying mitigation and compensation actions,
indicates measures already implemented and those to be implemented in the future. Again, dialogue with the
various stakeholders, authorities and competent bodies, as well as with the designated institutional technical
offices, such as the airport commission and noise working group, proved fundamental in the preparation of
this plan. The Noise Management Action Plan has been formulated in accordance with Decree 152/06 and
includes measures aimed at mitigating and offsetting the disturbance caused by the airport’s acoustic
impact, which the airport manager also intends to implement in synergy with the other parties involved in
various respects. The Plan is a dynamic document that may be updated in view of other new initiatives
developed over its life cycle.

As per Environmental Impact Assessment Decree No. 29 of February 25, 2013, in 2019 the Group carried
out acoustic investigations at noise-sensitive areas around the airport. These were designed to assess the
level of noise pollution deriving from airport operations and other typical urban sources. The results of these
studies are shared with the competent Authorities in order to identify any measures necessary to mitigate
and compensate for these impacts.
