Wildlife control

‘Wildlife Strikes’ are violent impacts between aircraft and wild animals (mainly birds). This is a phenomenon
with potentially severe consequences. In 2019, Bologna Airport recorded 77,126 movements with 33
confirmed impacts, of which 30 involving birds, and 3 involving hares. The number of strikes in relation to
total traffic volume, effects on flights and the abundance of fauna and species can be used to calculate the
BRI2 (Bird Risk Index), which, for the year 2019, was 0.06. The figure for 2019 is the same as in 2018,
despite an increase in movements and in bird sightings at the airport (from 116,901 in 2018 to 136,861 in
2019).

In 2020, AdB will continue with habitat remediation and the maintenance of woodland and shrub areas
outside the airport grounds and under AdB’s responsibility. Wildlife containment actions will also continue
through the management of catch cages and corrective actions for the protection of buildings (anti-bird nets
and needles). The working group formed between exponents of AdB and representatives of external entities,
companies and institutions yielded excellent results and will continue in 2020.

Containment of alfalfa

In 2020, in order to regulate the growth of airside grass cover, exploratory measures were carried out YX
to contain wild alfalfa using legally permitted selective herbicides. Similarly, approved disinfectants

were also used to reduce the micro-fauna (orthoptera) that are abundant airside, and which are a

strong attraction for birds. This plan to reduce the airside presence of wild alfalfa (a leftover mistake from airport plant
cultivation in the 1990's) was prompted by an ISPRA publication on wild grasses in urban and suburban
Mediterranean areas. The publication indicates that only plants that are native to these areas can make a real
contribution to reducing water usage and reducing the cost of crop care. The project is defined as “exploratory”
because the use of native wild herbaceous plants in green spaces has only recently been implemented in Italy. As
such, further studies are necessary, both to assess the ways in which these numerous types of flora may be used,
and to obtain a deeper understanding of the eco-physiological needs of the various species.
