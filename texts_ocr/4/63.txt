2.6 Protecting the environment and responding to the challenges of climate
change

The Group is committed to all aspects of sustainability, ranging from those of an
environmental nature to compliance with ethical and social principles, in view of the
important role which Bologna airport plays as a vital hub for the region. Bologna Airport
has always set itself the objective of pursuing the sustainable development of the
airport system in harmony with the protection of the environment, including the
important issues of air quality, noise, energy saving and the use of alternative sources
as integral to the company’s sustainable development policy.

 

The commitment includes day-to-day monitoring of the environmental impacts of CARE
airport activities, the identification of improvement measures and dialogue and

exchanges with the local community and stakeholders. In relations with the local community, the company
has consolidated its commitment through the signing of Territorial Agreements in support of environmental
compensation initiatives.

AdB has drawn up several policies, tools and organisational structures to guarantee, in all airport activities
and at all times, adequate levels of service quality, worker safety, environmental protection and airport
security, which are considered priority objectives of the company. In this regard, it has integrated Quality,
Environment, Energy and Safety at Work systems into a single integrated Business Management System, in
order to respond concretely to the requirements of the various applicable certification standards in line with
the Quality, Environment, Energy and Safety Policy. In particular, AdB applies the following Certifications in
its management:

= UNI EN ISO 9001:2015 quality certification

= UNI EN ISO 14001:2004 environmental certification
= OHSAS 18001 workplace safety certification

= UNI EN ISO 50001 energy certification

= Airport Carbon Accreditation - Level 2

The integrated management system ensures utmost control of significant environmental impacts, associated
risks, internal and external factors, and the governance of improvement policies.

The organisation contains an internal Environment, Energy and Safety at Work Department, with specific
resources dedicated to environmental issues. The integrated Policy is made available to the public in the
local community in order to guarantee complete transparency in the objectives that AdB intends to pursue.

Quality, Environment, Energy and Safety Policy’?

In order to maintain and improve the integrated Quality, Environment, Energy and Safety Management System, AdB
has defined a set of principles to base all its activities on. Regarding environmental protection, the Policy commits to:

e Evaluating, preventing and minimising environmental impact and risks to the health and safety of workers
(including accidents and occupational illnesses);

e Guarantee compliance with applicable environmental, workplace health and safety and energy efficiency
rules;
Promoting a reporting system to guarantee timely monitoring of performances;
Coordinating and monitoring the conduct of sub-contractors, suppliers and third-party companies acting on
behalf of AdB;

e Contributing to preventing climate change, to improving energy efficiency and to the increased use of
renewable energy sources.

Employees are required to maintain high standards of service quality, ensuring protection for the environment, energy
and water resources and health and safety at work, as well as the prevention and prompt correction of non-
conformities with regulations and corporate, national and international standards.

9 Integrated management systems (Quality, Environment, Energy and Workplace Safety and Security) are applied within AdB’s
organisational and operational environment. TAG is independently certified for its own quality, environment, and workplace safety and
security issues. FFM has yet to implement a certified management system, but has adopted operating practices and procedures
compliant with Italian and industry standards.
