Principal non-financial risk factors

With a view to progressive sustainability, AdB collaborated with company management in 2019 to expand
the number of key business risks mapped by the ERM project, taking into greater consideration the areas
included in Legislative Decree 254/2016. Firstly, in terms of human resources, analysis confirmed a need to
pay more attention to safety risks, such as those relating to airport safety, managing emergencies and
protecting and preventing occupational health and safety, given the current increase in traffic and the
Group’s significant infrastructure development plan. The dedicated departments of the company carefully
monitor and manage these aspects through specialised controls. The organisation and management system
known as the Safety Management System involves all airport operators, constantly monitoring activities
exposed to safety risk. Within this framework, the Safety Management function sets out, inter alia, measures
aimed at containing potential risks associated with situations of potential airside congestion. Actions include
the greater involvement of the safety department in planning infrastructural initiatives. At the beginning of
2020, AdB set up a Change Management working group to define the service and safety levels to be met
during airport construction activities. Internal and external safety communication initiatives will be launched
with the commencement of construction works, in addition to staff awareness schemes.

In 2019, Cyber Security was included as a primary corporate risk with potential social implications. In fact,
the Group also believes that airport systems may become vulnerable to increasingly aggressive cyber
attacks following the introduction of new digital transformation technologies. Said attacks could lead to
potential disruption for corporate stakeholders. The Group has dedicated departments in place to carefully
monitor and manage IT security using various controls and consolidated procedures. Additional initiatives
include routine audits of the network and information security areas, improving employee awareness, and
providing training around the subject. In addition, preventive security measures are being consolidated and a
multi-year Cyber Security Governance Plan is being prepared.

From an environmental standpoint, AdB is undertaking measures aimed at containing potential
environmental impacts relating to the disposal of de-icing fluid, and is also committed to using high-quality
de-icing fluids. In 2019, the Group created a dedicated de-icing pitch, which includes a system for collecting
and disposing of the liquid.

One potential aspect of risk relating to the management of human resources has to do with de-ageing, a
phenomenon that is particularly significant in administration and operations (e.g., security and PRM). The
Group has planned to offset ageing in administration by intensifying its training activities, whereas in
operations, where the appropriate conditions exist, it intends to implement various compensatory
mechanisms, such as re-assignment to less demanding areas in terms of manual labour, or the use of part-
time work schedules.

The additional risk factors identified may be attributed to the failure to complete the investments provided for
under the Action Plan in a timely manner due to unforeseeable events or delays in the process of obtaining
authorisation for and/or executing the works, with positive adverse effects on the amount of the tariffs that
may be applied and possible risks of withdrawal from or termination of the Agreement.

Finally, some social risks were identified with regard to relations with handling companies. In recent years,
handling companies — which are labour-intensive by nature — have focused in particular on containing labour
costs and increasing efficiency in response to an increasingly competitive market. In 2018, AdB collaborated
with institutions and unions to form a negotiating table in order to reach an agreement with handling
companies. The aim was to help protect employment and safeguard the quality of work carried out at the
airport. At the end of 2019, negotiations led to the signing of a memorandum of understanding for Bologna
Airport. This instrument guarantees conditions that help protect employment and encourage handling
companies to respect workers’ rights, both of which are key to guaranteeing high-quality passenger services.
In particular, the memorandum complements the sector’s national collective bargaining agreement and
provides a set of clear, shared rules regarding the application of the social agreement when airlines change
from one handling company to another, and employees are subsequently transferred.
