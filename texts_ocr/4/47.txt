2.5.1 Customer satisfaction and service quality

The quality of service, in a context in which customer feedback is increasingly

immediate, and shared with a vast number of customers, both current and 98.3%
potential, is an important market winning resource for the company. To Overall satisfaction
guarantee levels of quality in line with the above-mentioned standards, AdB index

has developed an ongoing cyclical plan of checks on passenger satisfaction
levels and audits on processes.

In particular the quality of service is monitored routinely through specific indicators, the results of which are
later published in the Airport Service Charter, and presents passengers with the minimum service standards
of the airport and the extent to which these standards have been achieved. The Group’s commitment to
maximising the services it offers to passengers translates into a variety of activities and initiatives conceived
with the goal of having a direct impact on passenger satisfaction. All the initiatives follow an integrated
approach that makes it possible to keep track of the various needs of the persons involved.

To focus more closely on customers and their needs, AdB sought to embed the customer care process
across the various departments to ensure better and more comprehensive customer management. The
process also involves outside parties, such as airlines and handlers at the airport through a questionnaire
regarding their satisfaction with the services and cleanliness of the terminal.

As regards the results achieved in 2019, the general levels of satisfaction are positive, in line with the
previous year, with an overall satisfaction index of 98.3%. Said positive results were achieved despite an
increase in users and the infrastructure’s limitations.

The punctuality of departing flights improved, reaching around 77%; waiting times were calculated according
to the ENAC method listed in Circular GENO6 and showed signs of stability both on departure and arrival.
Waiting times at security have improved significantly compared to 2018, while the time spent waiting to
check in, disembark aircraft and fetch baggage has also slightly decreased, consolidating the positive trend
seen over the last two years.

The self drop-off service was extended to additional airlines at the end of 2019. Waiting times at passport
control, on the other hand, have increased, due to an increase in passengers and the type of checks carried
out. AdB has attempted to improve its services, increasing the number of "ABC" gates at the airport’ by

installing three new machines at the outgoing passport controls and by employing additional members of
staff to support and help passengers.
