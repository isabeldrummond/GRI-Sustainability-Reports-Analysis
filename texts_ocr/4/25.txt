in various capacities determined, the principles of conduct and oversight formulated and an approach to
ensuring a constant flow of information to the Supervisory Board designed. The Model is managed by the
Supervisory Board, a body endowed with independent powers of initiative and control, appointed by the
Board of Directors, whose duties are updating and supervising the functioning of the Model. In order to
prevent and mitigate the risk of committing the offences included in Legislative Decree 231/2001, the Model
is integrated with the principles set out in the Ethics Code, the Anti-Corruption Policy and in various company
procedures, including those governing the environment, safety, human resources, general management
(gifts and gratuities), purchases and relations with the public administration. The Supervisory Board is
accompanied by the Anti-Corruption and Ethics Committee, a body tasked with monitoring and updating the
Anti-Corruption Policy. The subsidiary company TAG does not currently have an organisational model
pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01, while the subsidiary FFM intends to adopt its own Model during the
course of 2020.

Corruption prevention

Corruption destabilises the workings of the free marketplace and fuels criminal activity, meaning that it is not
only a moral and economic problem, but also an important impediment to the development of civil society.
Out of an awareness of the importance of this issue, AdB includes among its foremost goals that of acting
with loyalty, honesty, transparency and integrity, in accordance with national and international anti-corruption
regulations, guidelines and standards. To achieve these goals, the Company has voluntarily chosen to adopt
an Anti-Corruption Policy, enhancing its anti-corruption system and reinforcing the relevant provisions of
Legislative Decree 231/01 with those of Law 190/2012 governing public administrations and state-owned
companies, despite the absence of specific obligations in this regard. In point of fact, although following its
listing on the exchange with effect from July 14, 2015 AdB is no longer a state-controlled enterprise, its BoD
has reaffirmed its commitment to continuing to implement the safeguards aimed at protecting against
corruption. AdB believes that having an adequately implemented and monitored Anti-Corruption Policy may
serve as an effective means of raising awareness amongst employees and contractors, thereby preventing
the risk of episodes of corruption.

Anti-Corruption Policy

Through its Anti-Corruption Policy, AdB S.p.A. has sought to extend the scope of its anti-corruption measures aimed at public and
private sector entities, focusing on conduct that may be regarded as abuse of authority/position by employees in order to secure a
private benefit, where the risk of corruption of a public or private third party may arise, in terms of generating an unlawful interest or
advantage for the company. The Anti-Corruption Policy was issued in December 2017 and represents an offshoot of the Anti-
Corruption Plan adopted in 2014 in accordance with Law 190/2012, to which AdB was subject. The Policy was updated in 2019
following changes introduced with Law No. 3 of January 9, 2019 (“Anti-Corruption Law"), and as an adjunct to the other sections of
the Model, of which it is an integral part. In the Policy, the Company lists all offences to be prevented, lays out the method used to
manage the related risk, sets out all sensitive areas potentially at risk of abuse and the system for mitigating those risks and, finally,
identifies additional anti-corruption control measures supplementing the 231 Model.

Anti-Corruption and Ethics Committee

The Anti-Corruption and Ethics Committee is appointed by the BoD and is tasked with monitoring and verifying implementation of the
Anti-Corruption Policy and its efficacy, promoting amendments to the Policy in the event of breaches or significant changes in the
organisation and identifying procedures for selecting and training employees operating in areas particularly exposed to corruption. In
addition, this Committee promotes internal mobility or alternative measures for positions in which the risk of the committal of
corruption offences is greatest. It also has responsibility to manage reporting under its remit on unlawful conduct and protecting
confidentiality of the data of the person filing the report in compliance with the Whistleblowing Policy. For the 2018-2020 three-year
period, the Anti-Corruption and Ethics Committee is composed of the Corporate and Legal Affairs Director, Organisation and People
Development Director and Internal Audit Manager.

AGB has prepared a Whistleblowing Policy in support of procedures and approaches for managing reports of
criminal offences, fraud or violations that also ensure adequate protection for the whistleblower.
Whistleblowers may be the Company's internal and external stakeholders, including its employees,
regardless of the type of contract applicable and the functional level occupied, individuals acting on the
Company's behalf on the basis of contracts or engagement letters (e.g., agents, intermediaries, consultants
and suppliers), Directors and members of company bodies and other external stakeholders.

To ensure the development of a culture of ethics and respect, AdB has set up several reporting channels,
which are governed by the Whistleblowing Policy. The main reporting channel is the electronic platform,
which allows the whistleblower’s privacy to be fully protected. All reports are received by the Internal Audit
Manager, who operates as an independent entity, and as a member of the Anti-Corruption and Ethics
Committee. The Internal Audit Manager also provides constant support to the Supervisory Board, which
conducts an initial analysis of each report received and either deals with it first-hand or routes it to the
competent control body (Supervisory Board or Anti-Corruption and Ethics Committee) depending on its
content.
