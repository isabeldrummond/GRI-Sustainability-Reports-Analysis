Emergency management and business continuity

To ensure the continuity of services in conformity with relevant regulations and industry best practices, AdB
has defined an organisational model, procedures and systems that, in the event of an incident, allow an
analysis of the situation, mitigation of the service interruption and service restoration in appropriate
timeframes.

Specifically, it has adopted action plans that describe the mitigation and recovery procedures, a Help Desk
for first level operations (available from 5am to 9pm), infrastructure monitoring systems and modern security
devices such as firewalls.

During 2019, Bologna Airport concluded the integration of emergency plans in accordance with EU
Regulation 139/2014 by defining in the Airport Manual the actions to be taken in emergency situations.

AGB periodically verifies the efficacy of the procedures through drills and simulations, directly or with the
participation of other public or private organisations (such as law enforcement in the case of the Anti-
terrorism Plan). The various plans are updated where cases of non-conformity or areas with margins for
improvement are identified. In 2019, the Manager organised a table-top exercise simulating an incident
outside the airport grounds, involving not only the airport, but also the surrounding area. The exercise
concluded with the definition of shared operating procedures between the Airport and the local authorities to
establish an alarm procedure for all those involved, and clearly set out responsibilities and the chain of
command. A new tele-alert system was also implemented in 2019. This will allow more efficient
communication between the various parties involved in the different phases of the emergency. The drills
included in the internal emergency plan pursuant to Legislative Decree 81, together with law enforcement
drills, were also conducted as planned.
