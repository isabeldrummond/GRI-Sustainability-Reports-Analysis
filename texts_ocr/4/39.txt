2.3 Ensuring accessibility and public transport

A high degree of accessibility of the airport facility translates into easier access to

the infrastructure and hence into increased attractiveness for the local community

and catchment area. If a high degree of accessibility is combined with a high level

of connection to various destinations, the airport becomes a traffic facilitator and

catalyst, even beyond its catchment area.

Driven by an awareness of its strategic geographical position — approximately CONNECT
seven kilometres from the city centre and easily reachable from the motorway and
ring road — AdB has identified improving accessibility as one of its main strategic levers and decided to
invest in the People Mover project, which will offer a more sustainable alternative to taxis, chauffeured car
hire and bus services. The project calls for the construction of a rapid rail link (5 km) with the Bologna train
station, with a travel time of approximately seven and a half minutes. AdB’s total contribution of Euro 15
million was partly allocated to Marconi Express S.p.A., the concessionaire granted the contract to build and
operate the People Mover, and partly to the construction of the moving walkway between the airport People
Mover station and the passenger terminal. This new infrastructure will drive an expansion of AdB’s
catchment area by permitting an increasing number of passengers to reach the airport, with positive impacts
for both those departing from the Bologna metropolitan area and for those travelling to city by train.

People Mover - Marconi Express

The Bologna People Mover is a transport system
that can be progressively scaled up by adding
vehicles and gradually increasing capacity, in order
to keep pace with possible rises in demand. The
system, currently designed with three vehicles, can
carry approximately 560 passengers an hour in
each direction, for a total of 5,183,000 passengers
a year.

The train will make a single intermediate stop on
its route at Bertalia-Lazzaretto, a large urban area
currently undergoing redevelopment in which new
residential and commercial projects, university
classrooms and laboratories and a new university
dormitory are planned. The terminus will be
located near the airport's current passenger
terminal (departures area), to which will be linked
by a covered walkway through which passengers
will have direct access to the terminal. Access to the People Mover’s platforms will be by a turnstile-based ticket
validation system. The project is expected to be opened to the public in 2020 and will revolutionise the airport's
accessibility and connectivity.

 

The People Mover project is also a sustainable project: it is an environmentally friendly, electrically powered, fully
automatic rail-based system that will result in a significant reduction in the number of cars circulating in the area. In
addition, the photovoltaic panels installed on the track will form an “energy belt” capable of generating 35% of the
project’s energy needs, thereby reducing CO2 emissions by 300 tons — the equivalent of 14,000 trees saved. The total
cost of the investment is approximately Euro 120 million, of which Euro 15 million invested by AdB.

Having reviewed data on how people travel to the airport, it appears that most
passengers travel to the airport in their own private vehicle, or in a car
accompanied by a friend or relative (over 40%); around 25% of passengers use
public transport, and 23% take taxis. Other travel methods include rental cars and
shuttles organised by hotels.

In order to serve departing passengers, as well as waiting passengers and those accompanying them, AdB
pays great attention to its airport parking system. The airport offers seven parking areas, designed to meet
passengers’ various needs, both as a solution integrated into the terminal (P1 and P2, whereas P3 is located
a short distance) and where located off the airport grounds and reached by shuttle bus service (P4) or
pedestrian walkway (P5). These are in addition 2 express parking areas intended for those who park at the
airport for just a few hours. The P6 Summer Parking area was opened during the summer months outside
