AdB is aware that technological developments must be accompanied by growing awareness of cyber
security issues. For this reason, it has adopted a Governance model that adheres to the NIST Framework’?.
The model helps oversee the Group’s annual risk assessment through the implementation of business risk
management procedures, the adoption of a set of specific procedures and the use of new tools to help
support and protect the company. In this regard, a 4-hour annual training course has been organised to
improve awareness among employees, who also receive information about cyber security via notifications
from Eurocontrol's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).

R-Innovation Day

with promoting a culture of change throughout the company. The initiative consisted of two fun,

informative days aimed at raising awareness of the basics underpinning innovative processes and

stimulating curiosity and creativity. The end goal was to encourage new ideas. During the session, participants were
divided into groups and given a main theme to work on. These themes were based on the job categories included in
the Innovation Plan. Ideas put forward at the session will be included in the plan and will add further value to the
significant change project underway at AdB. One of the winning groups at the R-Innovation Day came up with an eco-
friendly project that involved recovering plastic (bottles) left at the airport before security checks.

The idea for R-Innovation Days was born within the Innovation, ICT & Q department, which is tasked j

2.5.3 Respond to the needs of Passengers with Reduced Mobility (PRM)

AdB pays particular attention to passengers with disabilities, who represent a constantly growing traffic
segment. To respond to the needs of passengers with reduced mobility (PRM), AdB's PRM service employs
around 40 members of staff, who assisted 44,869 passengers through the airport in 2019 (+9.1% compared
to 2018). The service is structured according to the principles and methods listed in Italian (ENAC Circular
GENO02A-2014) and European (Reg. 1107/06 concerning the rights of disabled persons and persons with
reduced mobility when travelling by air) legislation. Over the years, AdB has introduced a range of
infrastructural adaptations to improve accessibility for all categories of passengers, while developing a plan
of initiatives and services; the airport provides dedicated services for PRM passengers in compliance with
European Regulation EC 1107/06:

AGB is committed to ensuring quality standards for both its own management activities and those managed
by third parties. As such, the Group carries out annual audits of its internal services and of its suppliers
managing transfer care upon arrival. The Group also carries out monthly investigations into the satisfaction
of passengers using its PRM service. Aware that the quality of service care and management depends
largely on the training and skills of the people directly providing the services, AdB has also prepared
obligatory training courses and annual refreshers on disabilities for airport and non-airport staff who are in
contact with passengers with disabilities. AdB staff members tasked with PRM assistance are engaged in
continuous training sessions. The Group strives to modify and update its training courses on specific needs
