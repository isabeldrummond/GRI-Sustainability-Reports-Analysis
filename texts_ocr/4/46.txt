2.5 Providing a comprehensive high-quality experience

As part of its development strategies, the Group works every day with
unwavering commitment to provide passengers with a unique travelling
experience that prioritises customers through efficient innovative services, and
a comfortable, functional infrastructure.

 

The centrality of the customer, which means all-round satisfaction, is the se

measure of success of the airport and for this reason is one of the central

values of the organisation. One of the elements underlying the new AdB EXPERIENCE
strategy is the concept of “Experience” which breaks down into development

strategies aimed at the ongoing improvement of the services offered to airport users in the business areas in
which we operate, both directly and indirectly, while also constantly improving our standards of
safety/security, quality and respect for the environment.

Providing a passenger experience with comprehensive quality means working every day on the
infrastructure and processes in a climate of collaboration and the ever-present stimulus of all those who
influence the passenger’s journey. Therefore, it means guaranteeing a high-quality experience throughout all
phases of the journey, from preparing to depart, reaching the airport, and the travel experience within the
terminal all the way up to their return journey home. It means investing in innovative and digitalised
infrastructure and focusing on the needs of all passengers in respect of their differences and specific needs,
and ensuring conditions of maximum personal security and safety.

To achieve the standards it sets for itself, AdB has adopted a Quality Management System, which has
allowed the company to make decisions concerning the revision of airport processes/services. In addition to
the quality certification (ISO 9001) obtained in 1998 (now updated to ISO 9001:2015), the system is
integrated with the Environmental Management System (ISO 14001), the Occupational Health and Safety
Management Certification (OHSAS 18001), the Energy Management System Certification (ISO 50001) and
the Airport Safety Management System. The resulting Quality Policy is outlined by the circular ENAC Gen0d6-
2014, the guidelines on passenger service issued by ACI Europe (Guidelines for passenger services at
European Airports - 2018) and by the international standard UNI EN ISO 9001:2015.

Services Charter

Bologna Airport publishes a new edition of its Services Charter annually, in compliance with the provisions of circular
GEN-06 ENAC (National Civil Aviation Authority). The Airport Services Charter outlines a brief profile of Bologna
Airport, presenting its performance in terms of queue waiting times, the quality of services provided to passengers,
cleanliness, information and the set of factors that contribute directly to the travel experience of our airport users.

The Airport Services Charter is an instrument created to establish the service quality level which the airport operator
guarantees to passengers. Through this document, management — together with the carriers and the companies
which provide services to passengers — externally communicate its objectives and commitments in relation to the level
of services offered. The qualitative and quantitative standards guaranteed by the airport manager are established
through the monitoring of a number of specifically identified indicators. Performance data are shared monthly with
handlers and airlines to evaluate areas for improvement and potential mitigating actions. First and second-party audits
are also carried out in conjunction with other company certification systems. Corrective actions are then implemented
accordingly.

The Services Charter also contains information and advice to passengers as a guide for the utilisation of the airport

infrastructure and services. The Charter can be found at the airport’s information point and can also be downloaded
from the website.
