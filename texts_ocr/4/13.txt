1.1.1 Business Model and Strategic Plan to respond to sector changes

Airport business is traditionally divided into two general areas: aviation and non-aviation. The former
(Aviation Strategic Business Unit) involves managing, maintaining and developing airport infrastructure
dedicated to aeronautical activities, the provision of aviation services to passengers, users and airport
operators, and the development of the aviation business. The Group has adopted a multi-service business
model, serving both traditional airlines and low cost and charter airlines, exploiting the integrated
development opportunities provided by the range of clientéle. More generally, the policies adopted by the
business unit involve developing the network by opening up new markets, meeting the demands of local
companies, stimulate outgoing and incoming traffic demand, develop synergies with other local tourism
players and enhance infrastructure capacity.

The latter (the Non-Aviation Strategic Business Unit) involves developing the Group’s commercial areas and
services on the airport grounds, providing commercial services to passengers and airport users and
developing and marketing non-aviation services (e.g., car rental) and the terminal’s indoor and outdoor
advertising spaces. The commercial area extends over 4,500 square metres and includes 43 merchants,
such as duty-free stores, restaurants and retail shops, in addition to offices, operations spaces, warehouses
and hangars, for a total area of approximately 90,000 square metres under sub-concession to various
aeronautical operators. Development of the non-aviation business is based on improving the commercial
offer to satisfy passengers’ needs.

Since 2015 the Group has focused on executing the Strategic Plan underlying the Stock Market listing
project. The Plan sets out actions targeting the following objectives, which take account of the major
changes in the marketplace and within the individual business areas: the incremental development of route
network and traffic volumes, infrastructure development, development of the non-aviation business and a
focus on efficiency, quality and innovation. With the increasing growth in recent years, AdB has committed to
a process of redefining its identity by developing a new strategy inspired by the company’s vision and
mission.

In 2019, we launched the "Let's take our future by the hand" project, an internal communication initiative
aimed at increasing employee awareness of the Strategic Plan. The project foresees the progressive
involvement of the entire organisation, from the Management Board to Middle Management, and the
company as a whole. As such, we hope to tackle issues that are relevant to all areas of the company and to
better understand the daily actions of our colleagues.
