Procurement policies and tender management

When awarding work, service and supply contracts, AdB is required to follow the public record procedures
set out in the Italian Contracting Code (Legislative Decree 50/2016), as relevant to special sectors, where
the contracts in question are instrumental to the airport manager's “exploitation of a geographical area to
provide access to airports... and other transport terminals for air carriers” (pursuant to Article 119 of the
Legislative Decree 50/2016). When conducting tenders instrumental to its business that fall short of the
Community threshold, AdB applies its own internal Regulations, drafted in accordance with Community
procurement principles, but involving simplified procedures in terms of qualification and selection. AdB
awards work, service and supply contracts according to an approach and principles based on private law
where the tenders are not instrumental to its business, within the meaning of Article 119, regardless of their
estimated value (such tenders are also referred to as “non-core,” “peripheral” or, even more clearly,
“private”). Regardless of the procedural rules — public or private law — followed in the award process, the
consolidated use of clear, transparent selection procedures, ensuring equality of information and access to
bidding, as well as conditions of fair and proper competition in the negotiation process, provides a true
opportunity for fair competition on the market. In the cases identified in the Italian Contracting Code, and in
private-law procurement procedures more generally, contracts are also awarded directly to suppliers that
ensure AdB the highest standards of quality at a fair price in view of the goods or services provided, always
subject to review by the person responsible for the expense.

All suppliers are required to comply with the principles and provisions of the Ethics Code, the infringement of
which is deemed a breach of contractual obligations, allowing AdB to take any opportune protective
measures. The Tender Specifications also specifically reference collective bargaining agreements, accident
prevention and social insurance legislation and, where applicable, environmental protection and energy
savings regulations.

In 2018, AdB also signed a “Memorandum of Understanding on Outsourcing” (described in section 2.7.6.),
which came into effect in 2019. Said memorandum confirmed the company’s commitment to promoting
employment legality and job security in outsourcing activities. Outsourcing, as well as being a fundamental
lever for the economy and an opportunity for businesses, is also a driving force for maintaining and creating
jobs, and must be managed in a way that protects the rights of all workers involved. In 2019, the Group had
970 suppliers with total revenues of over Euro 75 million, broken down into 70% services and other costs
and 30% investments in concession rights and the improvement of airport infrastructure.

Strategic Sourcing & Procurement Manager

The investments process was reviewed in 2018 and is deemed to be key to the airport’s development

over the coming years. In 2019, a major review of tenders and business supplies was carried out, which

was further supported by the input of a Strategic Sourcing & Procurement Manager, as well as the QZ
drafting of new Integrated Procedures on the Liability Cycle, Planning and Monitoring Initiatives, Design

and Implementation. In particular, it became necessary to streamline the departments run by Process

Managers in line with the current Procurement and Purchasing Regulations. As such, a division was created between
Individual Process Managers with technical-administrative duties for “core” contracts (Supported by Project
Managers), and Expense Managers who manage “non-core” contracts.
