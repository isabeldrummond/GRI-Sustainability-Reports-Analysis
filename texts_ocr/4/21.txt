1.4 Stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis

AdB’s strategic approach to sustainability is based on the importance of the various categories of
stakeholder with whom the Group interacts. To leverage such a complex system as an airport, AdB has, over
time, developed specific methods and communications, feedback and engagement channels for all the
various internal and external stakeholders, in order to understand their social, economic, professional and
human needs, interests and expectations.

In a dynamic, competitive, and rapidly changing marketplace, being able to anticipate change and identify
emerging trends enables the Group to continue to generate shared added value consistently over the long
term. Establishing and consolidating relationships of
trust, based on the principles of transparency,
openness and listening, represents for AdB an
opportunity to understand the continuously evolving
expectations and needs of stakeholders who, whether
directly or indirectly, influence or are influenced by the
Group's activities.

Stakeholder engagement takes the form of specific
meetings, satisfaction surveys, interviews and
workshops aimed at creating open dialogue and
developing strategies for responding to the different
needs of individual stakeholders while ensuring the
sustainable achievement of common goals and
experience improvements.

 

Stakeholder identification and the mapping of their
expectations is fundamental in revealing current
performance and opportunities for developing relations and actions for the achievement of shared goals. In
fact, during 2019, the Group conducted in-depth analysis to define the main stakeholder categories, as well
as the relevant feedback mechanisms, commitments, and common goals for each stakeholder category.

Sustainability Survey

In pursuit of its commitment to include stakeholders in non-financial matters, in 2019, AdB sent an online survey to
stakeholders belonging to key groups in order to better understand their expectations and priorities regarding non-
financial issues. The survey was sent to Group employees, along with a representative sample of the top 10 airlines

in terms of traffic volume, the Users Committee and a representative sample of the Group’s top customers in the \
Non-Aviation Business sector, covering 80% of all turnover recorded in the sector.
