Despite being included in Legislative Decree 254/2016, topics relating to human rights have not been
deemed material in view of the geographical, regulatory and business environment in which the Group
operates. However, such topics are still discussed in the Information Report, since — as stressed in its Ethics
Code — the Group safeguards personal respect, dignity and integrity by ensuring equal opportunities, without
discrimination or abuse. In line with the analysis carried out in 2018, aspects such as effective, transparent
risk governance and management, stakeholder engagement and sustainable value creation are also
considered essential to the management of the business.

1.5 The organisational model for ethical management of the
business

The organisational model adopted by AdB consists of a system of safeguards (the

Organisation, Management and Control Model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01, PERFORMING
Ethics Code, Anti-Corruption and Whistleblowing Policy, Integrated Quality, Environment, — CORPORATION
Energy and Security Policy and Safety Policy) aimed at identifying the principles of reference for social and
environmental topics, while also pursuing sustainable, ethical growth of the airport. The main aim is to
consolidate within AdB — and spread outside the Group — transversal principles deeply rooted in values such
as the rule of law, integrity, transparency and impartiality by setting up two bodies, the 231 Supervisory
Board and the Anti-Corruption and Ethics Committee, both of which support the Organisational Model and
monitor the application of its principles, albeit each with specific responsibilities. In point of fact, business
ethics is a cornerstone of AdB’s governance and one of the crucial aspects of its internal control and risk
management system, which could potentially compromise the responsible conduct of the business. With this
in mind, AdB also requested that its subsidiaries TAG and FFM adopt their own Ethics Code, which it
encourages them to apply and update constantly.

Management of economic, environmental and social issues from the standpoint of sustainability is not
entrusted to a specific internal committee within the Board of Directors, but rather forms part of the overall
activities of the Company and its management. Protecting the environment, energy resources and
individuals is an integral part of the sustainable development policy adopted by Bologna Airport, which has
striven consistently to pursue its development goals in a fully sustainable manner.

The Ethics Code

The Ethics Code describes the set of ethical values and principles that are to inspire and shape the Company's actions, and which it
intends to adopt and apply in its dealings with all stakeholders involved during the course of its activities (employees, contractors,
customers, users, suppliers, public authorities and institutions). The Ethics Code is therefore addressed to the members of AdB’s
company boards, its Executives, employees and contractors, each within the framework of their tasks, responsibilities, duties and
activities, whether within the Company and the Group or in relations with third-party stakeholders.

All those who act on AdB's behalf must, in the course of their duties and responsibilities, comply personally, and ensure compliance
by others, with the principles set out in the Code: legality, moral integrity, respect for individuals, quality assurance, human and
environmental health and safety, fair competition, and transparency and truthfulness of information.

The Ethics Code is provided to all employees when they are hired. In addition to AdB, the subsidiaries FFM and TAG have also
adopted their own Ethics Code governing external and internal relations with each company and the Group, to ensure that such
relations are conducted in a socially and ethically responsible manner. In 2019, both subsidiaries updated their Ethics Codes in order
to align them with the policies adopted by their parent company.

Internal control system

In 2008, Bologna Airport adopted an Organisation, Management and Control Model pursuant to
Legislative Decree 231/01 (the “Model”). The Model lays down a set of rules and principles of conduct,
operating procedures and penalties designed to prevent those who act on the Company's behalf from
committing infringements and criminal offences. The Model considers various topics of a non-financial
nature, including the environment, social aspects, human resource management, respect for human rights,
corruption and bribery.

The Model is based on a sound process of identifying and assessing risks related to anti-corruption and
Legislative Decree 231, and is continuously updated. For each area of risk, the risk profiles associated with
the commission of specific offences have been identified, the individuals involved in carrying out the activities
