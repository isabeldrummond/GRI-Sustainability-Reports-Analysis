Finally, since 2015, AdB, the Emilia-Romagna Region, the Metropolitan City of Bologna, the Municipality of
Bologna, the Municipality of Calderara and transport company TPer have been committed to the Territorial
Implementation Agreement for the decarbonisation of the airport, pursuant to Regional Law 20/2000, in
response to the need to mitigate the environmental impacts associated with long-term infrastructural
development, and in compliance with the provisions of the Decree of the Environmental Impact Assessment
Master Plan.

Local community engagement

As well as interacting with institutions, AdB collaborates with other key local players to create value for the
community, companies and local stakeholders. Through commercial activities and the commercial spaces at
its disposal, the Group promotes various initiatives and activities, creating opportunities for cultural and
artistic promotion and increasing the visibility of local excellences, in particular regarding the automotive and
food-and-wine sectors. The visibility from advertising activities and participation in events hosted by the
airport indeed helps to create value and consolidate the brand awareness of local companies in the eyes of
the national and international public passing through the airport. In 2019, the third edition of the Marconi
Music Festival, the first ever airport music festival, took place in collaboration with the Emilia Romagna
Festival. During the music festival, passengers and the public were engaged in a series of concerts and
events, with the presence of exciting young talents and major international names. The attention paid to
typical food and restaurants in Emilia-Romagna tradition is an important element in the promotion of
excellence, including in culture. Since 2019, AdB has also been part of the “Capo D” network, which brings
together some of Bologna’s most active and relevant companies in the areas of welfare, equal opportunities
and organisational well-being*®.
