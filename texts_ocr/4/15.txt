1.1.2 2030 Agenda: the Group's interactions with Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs)

On September 25, 2015, the United Nations endorsed a document entitled “Transforming our World: The
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” The 2030 Agenda sets out an action plan for people, the planet
and prosperity through 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) divided into 169 Targets. Implementing
this ambitious Global Agenda requires the full involvement of all countries and stakeholders, including those
active in the private sector. A comparison between the results achieved by AdB during the year and the

Sustainable Development Goals can be found below:
