Safety governance

In accordance with Italian and international regulations, AdB has adopted a safety governance system based
on committees. The Safety & Compliance Review Board plays a pro-active role in discussion of all aspects
of safety and provides support to the Accountable Manager with the implementation of safety policies and
objectives and verification that the infrastructure, organisation and procedures comply with regulatory
requirements. The Safety Committee is a consultative body whose members, who have decision-making
autonomy and the ability to assume outward-facing responsibility, are selected from the top management of
both public and private organisations involved in airport activities. The committee ensures the participation of
all parties operating at the airport, involves all airport operators in safety objectives, analyses and proposes
solutions to emerging issues, involves operators in acting on the results of the SMS (e.g. trend analysis, risk
assessment, corrective actions), and jointly analyses emerging issues in airport operations and changes
proposed by the various members of the committee.

The Local Runway Safety Team is specifically tasked with analysing and assessing the operational safety
of the runway and the manoeuvring area more generally, with the goal of contributing effectively to the
adoption of appropriate corrective and/or preventative measures aimed at limiting and reducing the number
of runway incursion events. In addition to AdB, the Local Runway Safety Team comprises representatives
from: Airlines Operators Committee (AOC), ENAV (Flight Assistance Agency), ENAC (Civil Aviation
Authority), ANACNA (Flight Controllers Association), Pilots Association, airport vehicle drivers and the airport
manager’s Movement Area and Planning departments.

Safety training and awareness-raising activities

Safety awareness campaigns were carried out in 2019 through ad hoc safety meetings held at the ramp service
centre. The most commonly addressed topics were: respecting the ‘no-touch’ policy; the importance of approaching
aircraft safely with vehicles, guided by a worker on the ground; the obligatory use of chocks for aircraft without
stabilisers; and the need to park GSE (Ground Support Equipment) in areas where it does not obstruct aircraft
operations. Several ramp operators contributed to the creation of a video highlighting the importance of approaching
aircraft correctly with stair and elevator vehicles so as to prevent falls from height.

The safety committee also included a training and informational session on cyber security, a topic that is constantly
evolving, and to which EASA is dedicating increasing attention. Specifically, the convergence of IT and SMS has led
the committee to appreciate how the correct management of tools and technologies is fundamental in protecting
information systems from external attacks.

The airport manager’s hazard log has also been updated, through the insertion and assessment of hazards
associated with use of the new de-icing apron. Finally, a plan was researched and implemented to ensure efficient
management of ‘contracted activities’, as defined within EU Regulation 139/2014 (‘contracted activities’ are those
activities that fall within the Manager's Certificate, and which the manager may assign to external suppliers. These
activities are subject to specific checks and to management as set out in EU Regulation 139/2014 - ADR.OR.D.010
Contracted activities).
