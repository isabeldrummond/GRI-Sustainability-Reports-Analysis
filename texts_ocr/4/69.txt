2.6.4 Management of water resources

Aware that the scarcity of water resources is one of the most urgent issues in the global debate on climate
change and environmental impacts, AdB has paid particular attention to the monitoring of its water
consumption and to analysing wastewater quality. In order to reduce water consumption and water pollution,
Bologna Airport has undertaken various actions aimed at improving the efficiency of the management model
and of airport facilities and buildings. In particular, AdB is committed to the study and analysis of its water
consumption, to the mapping of water uses and to the identification of further actions to minimise
consumption. Furthermore, the company has begun the construction of a new airport infrastructure
purification plant, which will contribute significantly to reducing environmental impacts in terms of water
pollution.

The assessment of sewage discharge demonstrates its group's compliance with the limit values set by law
(Legislative Decree No. 152/06). Specifically, the most critical figure relates to the COD parameter, which is
in turn tied to the use of the de-icing fluid employed on airport pavement and aircraft. As Airport Manager,
AdB must also guarantee the continuous and regular provision of ground handling services for carriers
operating at the airport. It must therefore provide adequate tools for cleaning aircraft of snow and ice
contamination, the so-called activity of de-icing. At certain times in the winter, there is the risk that the limit
values may temporarily be exceeded in the event of massive use of de-icing fluid.

De-icing pad

To optimise processes and reduce the impact of liquids, a remote de-icing pad was constructed in 2019.

From 2020, this provides a dedicated area where de-icing treatments can be carried out and liquids can

be collected and disposed of as per applicable law. In September 2019, training began for de-icing Xg
supply operators in order to implement the new operating methods. In short, these allow de-icing to be

carried out with the aircraft's engines running, meaning that the aircraft can proceed directly to the

runway for take-off once the operation has been finished, thereby streamlining the entire process. In the second half
of 2019, AdB also implemented new software to manage the entire de-icing process, and provided training for all the
operators involved.

The assessment of water drawn refers to water utility consumption by AdB (including FFM) and TAG.

During 2019, AdB studied the feasibility of collecting and reusing rainwater from the exterior of airport buildings,
according to the characteristics of the water collected. This assessment identified the work that will be carried out
according to a plan which is currently being developed.

The table shows the average values recorded during various analyses carried out during the reference year. The
reference area is the airport grounds, including the rainwater collection system that serves airport and operator activities
within the airport grounds. These data refer to the water quality parameters of the run-off water overflow system at the
Olmi Quarry (Discharge C) and the water collection site associated with it (Fosso Fontana).
