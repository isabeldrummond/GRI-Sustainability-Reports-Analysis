1.1 Market overview, business model and strategy

Market overview

The AdB Group's core business involves acting as concession holder operating under special exclusive rights to the
Bologna airport grounds. It operates in an industry that is highly regulated at domestic and international levels. The main
industry actors are ENAV (Italy’s National Agency for Flight Assistance), ENAC (Italy's National Civil Aviation Authority),
Italy's National Agency for Flight Safety, airport managers, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and the ICAO (the
International Civil Aviation Organisation). The concession, which expires in 2044, permits the design, development,
implementation, amendment, management, maintenance and use of plant and airport infrastructure. Concessions are
contingent on signing the Regulatory Agreement and agreements governing relations with public administrations in
respect of the performance of institutional duties. 2019 is the last year of the four-year 2016-2019 Regulatory Agreement
between ENAC and AaB. In 2019, the company therefore initiated negotiations and preliminary activities with ENAC for
the drafting of the Regulatory Agreement for the 2020-2023 four-year period, and with the Transport Regulation Authority
(“ART”), for the calculation of the airport tariffs for the same four-year period. On January 16, 2020, the Transport
Regulation Authority passed the resolution definitively approving the tariff model of reference with regard to the proposed
revision of airport fees 2020-2023 submitted by AdB.

Sector performance

Global passenger traffic recorded growth of 4.2% in 2019, confirming a positive trend for air traffic, despite a slight
slowdown in comparison to 2018. Goods traffic, however, shows a strong global downward trend, with volumes
decreasing by 3.3% compared to 2018. Passenger traffic in Europe also grew by 4.2% in 2019, which is in line with the
traffic increases seen in other global regions. This reflects the global slowdown compared to 2018 due to the current
uncertain financial situation. Despite the expansion of international trade in the third quarter of 2019 — a situation aided
by the mitigation of risks linked to customs disputes between the United States and China and a “hard Brexit” — the
consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic will have a significant impact on the future course of global economic
performance in 2020. 2019 also saw a decrease in European cargo traffic (-1.8%), owing mainly to weaknesses in the
German manufacturing sector and uncertainty surrounding Brexit’.

The Italian market in 2019 saw passenger traffic growth of 4.0%, while Bologna Airport reported growth of 10.6%,

COVID-19 Emergency

Despite the severe reduction in traffic following the health emergency, Bologna Airport has remained open and operative.
It has set up task forces dedicated to managing and mitigating the effects of the current crisis, through measures
regarding health and hygiene and working patterns. These include the implementation of remote working for all office
staff, the application of accrued holiday, and the activation of the Extraordinary Temporary Redundancy Scheme as of
March 21. Among the measures we have implemented, the Group felt it was important to offer every employee a new
healthcare tool, in the form of a specific insurance policy covering COVID-19 infections.

Despite the particularly negative situation and uncertainty around the timeframe for recovery, the Group is confident that
the emergency situation is temporary and, regardless of how long it takes to recover from the pandemic, the consequent
economic downturn will be overcome.
