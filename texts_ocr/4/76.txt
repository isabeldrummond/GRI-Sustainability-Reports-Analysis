Through a user-friendly process, the assessment system focuses on observable and easily assessable
conduct relevant to business goals. The starting point of the evaluation system is the identification of the key
skills and conduct for the company. Based on AdB's Charter of Values, a leadership model was designed in
accordance with the company’s strategic objectives and the company’s core competencies were identified
accordingly. Subsequently conduct relevant to each specific functional department and to each role were
defined. The assessment is in qualitative terms, based on a daily, infographic scale with four-monthly
feedback to develop greater and more continuous awareness of the role and skill requirements.

In 2019, the system’s department and position Competency Dictionary was updated after organisational
changes were implemented, and on the basis of initial user feedback. IT system performance was also
improved, and some interfaces were made available. Among these are a quick guide and some search
functions. Finally, the Multi-appraiser module is currently in development. This will allow assessments of this
type to be rolled out to operative groups (currently in testing for Passenger care and Terminal Supervisors).
