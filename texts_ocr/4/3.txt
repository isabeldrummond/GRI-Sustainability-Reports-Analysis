Letter to the stakeholders

The second edition of the Aeroporto G. Marconi di Bologna S.p.A. Group’s Consolidated Disclosure
of Non-Financial Information tells the story of a record year for Bologna Airport and for the entire Group, as
passenger numbers in 2019 grew 10.6% to 9.4 million, and the number of routes offered rose to 120. This is
an important milestone for us, and one which reflects our ability to maintain the highest levels of passenger
and service quality, despite difficulties that included structural issues. Satisfaction levels remained extremely
high in 2019, with an overall Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) of 98.3%.

2019 also marked another step towards understanding the importance of our daily commitment to
sustainable development, environmental protection, focus on the needs of the local community and
passengers and emphasis on individual development. There have been many steps along the way, starting
with the integration of sustainability as a cross-sector dimension of Group strategy, and the consequent
launch of a project designed to communicate and spread this new strategic approach to all our employees.
During the year we also decided to accept the challenge laid down by ACI Europe to reach net zero carbon
emissions from airport operations by 2050, and integrated specific incentives into our Traffic
Development Strategy which reward the use of environmentally friendly aircraft. Our commitment to
environmental protection and sustainable development is also formalised in the Mobility Management
agreement we signed with the Municipality of Bologna, and our collaboration with external partners to
implement the Sustainable Mobility Plan for workers in the airport community. This is a tool which is highly
innovative - we are the first airport in Italy to implement it - and in the benefits it brings to the environment,
the community and employees, it is also sustainable. Also in 2019 we extended our stakeholder
engagement activities, involving internal and external stakeholders of various types in updating the
materiality matrix.

Among its most significant social initiatives, in 2019 AdB concluded the commitment it took on in
2018 to develop and sign a Memorandum of understanding for Bologna Airport. This is a tool which
guarantees conditions that help protect employment and encourage handling companies working within the
airport to respect workers’ rights. In June 2019, the Group also joined the “Capo D” network, which brings
together some of Bologna’s most active and relevant companies in the areas of welfare, equal opportunities
and organisational well-being. The result is a true Community of Businesses for Equal Opportunities, united
in close collaboration with the Metropolitan City and the Municipality of Bologna.

The principled, sustainable growth for which the AdB Group aims in order to guarantee well-being
and prosperity for the airport and the area around it has been brought to an abrupt halt by the national and
international emergency linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bologna Airport is one of the few Italian airports
that has remained open and operative despite the almost complete absence of traffic since mid-March. As
well as implementing all the health and hygiene measures necessary to prevent the spread of the virus
among airport workers, we have allowed many employees to work remotely, and as of March 21, brought in
the Extraordinary Temporary Redundancy Scheme to as far as possible mitigate the economic impact of the
health crisis. Among the measures we have implemented, we felt it was important to offer every Group
employee a new healthcare tool, in the form of a specific insurance policy covering COVID-19 infections. The
speed and intensity with which the virus has spread, the severe effect it has had on air travel and, above all,
uncertainty surrounding the possible duration of the epidemic, make it extremely difficult to predict how this
year will play out. Despite the particularly negative situation and uncertainty around the timeframe for
recovery, we are confident that the emergency situation is temporary and, no matter how long it takes us to
overcome the pandemic, we will recover from the consequent economic downturn.
