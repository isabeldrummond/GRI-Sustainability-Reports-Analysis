1.4.1 Materiality Analysis

The non-financial reporting process involves first identifying material topics, i.e. those that have a significant
impact on the Group’s economic, social and environmental performance and that therefore are capable of
significantly influencing the expectations, evaluations and decisions of stakeholders. In order to define the
aspects on which to focus reporting, the Group conducted an initial materiality analysis in 2018 in order to
identify — in keeping with its business strategy — the Group’s sustainability priorities and determine the
contents of the Consolidated Disclosure of Non-Financial Information, in accordance with the provisions of
Legislative Decree 254/2016 and the GRI Reporting Standards. Said analysis continued into 2019 with the
involvement of a number of internal and external stakeholders, such as Group employees and key
customers from the Aviation and Non-Aviation sectors.

Relevant themes were identified based on an initial phase of analysis of company sources (particularly the
Ethics Code, strategic plan and internal policies and procedures) and external sources (such as an analysis
of major industry trends), with the goal of identifying all topics potentially relevant to the Group. External
sources include not only specific reports and media searches, but also industry best practices, based on
benchmarking of the main players in the sector at the international level. In identifying potentially relevant
topics, reference was made to the aspects set out in Legislative Decree 254/2016 and the topics considered
specific to the airport operators sector by the additional guidelines provided in the GRI Sector Supplement.
Based on the analysis carried out, the Group was able to confirm that the issues identified as relevant in
2018 remained so in 2019. The process included a second phase that saw representatives from different
stakeholder categories and the company's top management team provide input so that the materiality matrix
could be assessed and updated. In 2019, the Group sent Employees, Airlines and Commercial Operators an
online questionnaire in order to gauge their opinion and expectations regarding certain sustainability issues.
The participants graded each issue from 1 to 10. The same issues were presented to Senior Executives so
that they could also grade them from 1 to 10 in terms of their relevance to the business. The results of the
feedback initiatives were consolidated, allowing the Group to prioritise certain issues and position them on
two axes in order to construct a materiality matrix. The third and final phase involved the Control and Risks
Committee approving the materiality analysis results on February 24, 2020.

Following analysis, priority was given to development of the airport and its destination network, customer
satisfaction, service quality, airport safety, emergency management and employee training and
development. These key areas are consistent with the Group's priorities and the needs of the various
stakeholder categories involved in the materiality analysis.
