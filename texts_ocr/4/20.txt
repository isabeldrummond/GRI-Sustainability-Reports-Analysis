Diversity on management and control boards

educational and professional background. In fact, the assessment of the Board's functioning, which began
on November 11 and ended on December 17, 2019, did not bring to light any criticalities relating to the
professional characteristic and gender of Board members. In addition, the Group applies the existing
provisions of Article 147-quater of the Consolidated Finance Act with regard to the issue of gender diversity.
