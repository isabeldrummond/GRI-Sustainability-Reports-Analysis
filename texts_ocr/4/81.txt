2.7.6 Industrial Relations

AdB belongs to the Italian airport managers association Assaeroporti, which represents members at a
national level in union negotiations and national collective bargaining. Through Assaeroporti, AdB signed the
National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the sector. The National Collective Bargaining Agreement for
the Air Transport Workforce and supplementary corporate agreements apply to all of AdB’s employees,
except those with managerial qualifications to whom the National Collective Bargaining Agreement for
Companies Producing Goods and Services applies. The same contract applies to TAG, while FFM also
applies the CBA, but in the Handlers sector.

In the context of industrial relations, AdB promotes respect for norms and industrial and trade union
relations, and encourages positive relations with the representatives of airport operators. AdB participates in
national meetings with ASSAEROPORTI for the renewal of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement,
together with national Air Transport trade unions, while maintaining continuous relations at a local level with
local trade unions and the corporate trade union. The main trade union agreements signed in 2019 by AdB
with the general trade unions and the corporate trade union were for the implementation of the “Hour Bank’,
the provisions for single parents, the extension of the seasonality agreement, and the one-off increase to
Welfare 2019, following the positive results achieved in 2018.

AGB also completed its Site Protocol for Tenders, which highlighted the issues of legality, workplace safety,
and transparency. The protocol was signed by the trade unions (CGIL, CISL, UIL and UGL), the Municipality
and the Metropolitan City of Bologna in 2018, who provided support during the negotiations for the Handling
companies and trade unions on the section dedicated to the handler market. At the Metropolitan City of
Bologna in December 2019, and after many years of talks, the three handling companies that operate at the
airport co-signed with AdB the section of the protocol concerning the application of the handlers’ social
agreement in the event of assisted airline changes. Clear rules were therefore set out and integrated with
those stipulated contractually, to avoid instances of social dumping and potential crisis situations at the
airport.

In the final months of 2019, AdB, Assaeroporti and the main Italian airports worked on renewing the specific
Airport Managers section of the Collective Bargaining Agreement for Air Transport, which was then signed
on January 17, 2020.

Minimum notice period for operational changes (GRI Standard 402-1)

Since AdB operates in an increasingly dynamic and competitive market, requiring rapid and immediate organisational
changes to meet business needs, AdB does not implement specific policies concerning the minimum notice to be
given in case of operational changes, nor does the sector collective bargaining agreement provide for a minimum
notice period to employees in case of organisational changes.

On the occurrence of operational changes, the company follows corporate reorganisation phases through service and
personnel communications, and, if changes affect Airport Safety issues, through change management procedures in
accordance with Airport Regulation No. 139.
