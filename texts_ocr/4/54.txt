2.5.5 Airport safety and emergency management

Safety and Security are two very different but interrelated concepts. In the airport sector, these terms are
defined as follows:

=" Safety: Safety requires an airport operations system that guarantees certain pre-established safety
conditions, assesses its own effectiveness and corrects any non-conformities;

= Security: Security requires procedures and resources to be targeted at preventing and mitigating
acts of unlawful interference with the civil aviation system on the ground, on board aircraft and within
the airport grounds.

Safety

AdB has developed for all parties operating airside its own Airport Safety Policy, as per the highest
international standards, in line with best practices and in compliance with all applicable national and
international regulatory requirements. The Policy aims to guarantee adequate levels of safety, to prioritise
safety among the objectives of all airside operations managers and to ensure that the Policy is understood
and applied at all levels, internally and externally to the organisation.

Just Culture is an essential element for an effective SMS

The Safety Policy is based on two strategic pillars:

Just Culture

Just Culture reflects a system in which operators are
encouraged, perhaps even rewarded for, providing essential

  
   
   

        
   

  

reporting system, as allowing operators to report significant

information on safety, indicating events in which they have
been involved personally.

Just Culture, differing from “no blame culture”, reflects a
climate of confidence in which operators act without fear of
repercussions or punitive or disciplinary actions,

Just Culture is however not a synonym for unconditional
immunity and therefore conduct and behaviours featuring

safety events. The process of Safety Management System

 

(SMS) reporting is part of Just Culture, as permitting

 

operators, both frontline and back office, and company

 

management, to report significant events for the safety of
operations, with the guarantee of a non-punitive culture.
This protection is applied to all significant events for safety,

 
 

   
   

negligence, serious culpability, incompetence, omission or
fraud, sabotage or deliberate and repeated lack of regard for
operating rules and safety procedures, is not considered
acceptable.

   
     
   

whether with or without consequences.

AGB believes that progress in the safe management of airport activities can only be achieved through the
involvement of all personnel, operators, airport bodies and stakeholders in conduct and attitudes inspired by
the very highest safety standards.

Safety Management System

The Safety Management System (SMS) is configured to guarantee pre-established safety conditions, to
assess its own effectiveness and to implement any identified corrective and preventive actions. The main
goal of the SMS is the prevention of accidents. This is pursued through the identification, evaluation,
mitigation and containment, within acceptable and controllable levels, of safety-related hazards.

Since the SMS concerns all airport safety activities, all airport bodies are required to participate and
immediately inform the Airport Manager of any safety issue, incident, inconvenience or event that has, or
might have, compromised the safety of operations. Furthermore, all airport bodies are obliged to comply,
providing the Airport Manager with all the documentation and information necessary to identify causes.
Effective management of the SMS requires the participation, commitment, knowledge and experience of all
airport personnel.

The communication, information and promotion process is essential in engaging all airport parties in the
pursuit of the safety and security objectives and for the effective implementation of Group policies.
Cooperation between all relevant internal and external parties is the fundamental principle on which this
process is based: in order to ensure an efficient, integrated approach, AdB assumes the role of coordinator
between operational activities and the activities of the various airport bodies.
