they were implemented.

AGB has also participated in various energy efficiency initiatives and programmes in order to cut its CO2
emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change In 2009, it took part in the international Airport
Carbon Accreditation programme, an initiative promoted by Airport Council International and aimed at
monitoring and improving the airport sector’s carbon footprint. Additionally, in collaboration with local
authorities and institutions, AdB promotes initiatives and actions to mitigate general environmental impacts.
Through the Regional Agreement for a Low-Carbon Airport, signed with regional authorities in 2015, AdB
has committed to perform work with a total cost of Euro 6.5 million over a period consistent with the
timeframe for implementation of the airport Master Plan. The agreement provides for a reduction in CO2
emissions in relation to airport infrastructures and accessibility, and for the absorption of climate-altering
direct emissions through the creation of a wooded green belt to the north of the airport.

The measurement and assessment of Bologna Airport's carbon footprint is essential in gathering information
for the implementation of CO2 reduction initiatives, for the identification of cost containment opportunities and
for the consideration of climate impacts in the decision-making process. Additionally, this process allows AdB
to play a leading role in the field of environmental responsibility, to respond to the demands of citizens and
public administrations for greater disclosure regarding climate impacts, and, finally, to prepare for the
introduction of binding regulations on the subject, which might modify the current regulatory framework.

In 2019, 100% of the energy produced by the AdB network is certified electricity generated from renewable
sources, which contributed to a considerable reduction in Scope 2 emissions, according to the “market-
based” calculation. In addition, diesel power stations in several buildings were decommissioned in favour of
increased natural gas use. A lighting efficiency plan began in 2019, involving the installation of LED light
fixtures, resulting in a reduction in electricity consumption and indirect emissions (Scope 2). This involved
optimising the efficiency of the lighting system in management offices, and beginning the replacement of
lamps at the boarding piers.

Innovation plan THE FREE MARKET FOR ENERGY

Within the Innovation plan - Environment sector, AdB has developed an initiative to raise awareness of

energy issues among the airport community. A cross-department group, co-ordinated by the Energy NS
Manager, worked on the initiative in order to educate the airport community on innovations in the free

market for energy, providing the opportunity to sign electricity and gas supply contracts at lower prices.
Specifically, the work group:

e identified commercial partners with whom to develop welfare initiatives

e defined the assisted conditions for electricity and natural gas supply contracts

e — organised informational meetings on the free market for energy and presented and promoted the initiative

November 2019 saw the conclusion of the initiative with a well-attended meeting at the airport's Marconi Business
Lounge. Participants in the meeting were Illumina, as a commercial partner, the Esperienza Energia consortium, as a
technical partner, and representatives from Bologna Airport.
