2.6.3 Air quality

During 2018, the company introduced its new air quality monitoring system, operational in September. AdB
is deeply aware that, by the very nature of its activities, in which aircraft produce considerable emissions, it is
a significant source of atmospheric pollution. The airport is also located within a geographical area already
affected by a high degree of atmospheric pollution coming from road traffic. The new monitoring system
regularly measures the concentration of pollutants around the airport. These data are managed by ARPAE
and published every month on the Company's website, guaranteeing maximum public visibility.

Performance Indicators (GRI G4-AO5)

The data refer to the average daily air quality values measured by the fixed monitoring stations located outside the
airport grounds. The trends in this data are closely correlated with the typical sources of pollution, especially road traffic,

found in the areas where the monitoring stations are located. Given the volatility of the pollutants measured, the effects

of the airport are not directly identifiable.
