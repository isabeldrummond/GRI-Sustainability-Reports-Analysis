Airlines and traffic performance

AGB believes that continuing to offer a varied range of flights suited to the needs of the various segments of
users, while essentially striking a balance between the low-cost and legacy components, is strategic to the
growth of its business. The Airport offers a wide range of carriers, allowing it to meet the range of needs
expressed by the various types of traffic and passengers:

Bologna’s Guglielmo Marconi Airport enjoyed further growth in 2019, with total passengers surpassing nine
million for the first time (9,405,920’, to be precise), an increase of 10.6% on 2018. Said growth is primarily
owed to international traffic. There was a 14% increase in total global passenger traffic, while the domestic
market remained substantially stable. Total movements increased by 7.9%, reaching 77,126, with a 4.9%
increase in legacy flights, and a 14.7% increase in low cost flights, while tonnage increased by 8.4%.
Negative cargo traffic trends persist (-7.3%). In 2019, passenger traffic was composed as follows: 40%
legacy (42.2% in 2018), 58.4% low cost (56.3% in 2018), 1.3% charter, 0.1% transit and 0.1% General
Aviation. Strong traffic performance is owed to the addition of four new airlines, the expansion of the Group's
destination network and a general increase in airline frequency.

Traffic Development Policy

The Group’s Traffic Development Policy aims to attract more traffic to the airport via an incentive model ON
that hopes to govern development in a transparent and non-discriminatory way, while optimising the use

of airport infrastructures in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations. The Policy was put in QZ
place on January 1, 2020 and also contains a sustainability objective: AdB is committed to growing and

developing its airport and network through environmentally sustainable activities, such as reducing the
environmental impact of its aircraft and collaborating with various stakeholder groups and the local authorities. Some
of the incentives included in the Policy are aimed at rewarding aircraft with a reduced environmental impact.
