The strategy is based on four main pillars of the Companyâ€™s future development:

CONNECT

The Group seeks to maintain a varied range of flight offerings suited to various types of users by
adding to the number of airlines operating out of the airport, while continuing to maintain good margins
also on the new traffic generated. In terms of traffic development, the Group targets the adding of
routes, with the introduction of new Eastern and long-haul destinations, while boosting frequencies to
existing destinations. The Group also focuses on improving airport accessibility, through the
development of ground connections and the expansion of its catchment area.

DEVELOP

The investments outlined in the Master Plan and Regulatory Agreement are fundamental to the
development of the company's business. The strategy in question calls for an efficient use of the
existing infrastructure's capacity and modular implementation of new investments to ensure that
infrastructure capacity keeps pace with expected traffic development. The passenger terminal
expansion project is a key part of the infrastructure development plan, permitting the
development of - in particular - the security control areas and the boarding gates, in addition to
extending dedicated commercial space. The Group also plans to develop non-aviation business
with the opening of new stores, new car spaces and the extension of the range of services
available to passengers.

 

EXPERIENCE

Within its strategic development, the Group is focused on ensuring the constant improvement
of the services offered to airport users in its fields of operation, both directly and indirectly,
while also constantly improving its standards of security, quality and respect for the
environment. In order to support and improve all aspects of operations and generate Customer
loyalty, the Group considers it key to develop a culture of innovation which revolves around the
installation of technology that facilitates greater interaction with passengers and optimises the
airport travelling experience.

CARE

The Group is committed to all aspects of sustainability, ranging from those of an environmental nature
to compliance with ethical and social principles, in view of the important role which Bologna airport
plays as a vital hub for the region.

The Group also strives to develop those who work at the Airport and build an organisation which
responds to the evolving demands of the market and which supports the individual in their work.

The Group has furthermore identified two overarching guidelines to the strategic objectives identified above which are viewed
as a touchstone for company operations. In light of increasing awareness surrounding sustainability and the urgent climate
situation, in 2019, the Performing Corporation was renamed the Performing and Sustainable Corporation:

MAXIMISE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The Group is focused on consistently improving the financial performance and on ensuring an
adequate return for shareholders.

PERFORMING AND SUSTAINABLE CORPORATION
In 2019, AdB hoped to make sustainability more relevant to its corporate strategy by
incorporating it as a cross-cutting component. As such, the Group aims to improve the
efficiency and efficacy of its processes and internal structure, with a view to improving
company performance and development, while paying increasing attention to sustainability in
its environmental, social and governance components.
