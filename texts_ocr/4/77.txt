2.7.4 - Training

A company’s employees are its cornerstone. They manifest its knowledge, skills,
experience and personal qualities, and constitute the company’s competitive and
value-generating engine through the services that we offer to customers and the
market. People are therefore the company’s value creators, and satisfying their
Core, departmental, individual training needs means promoting the development of the organisation
and role-specific as a whole. In line with this vision, training at AdB is one of the pillars of human
competencies resources management and development. The company firmly believes in
promoting the development of the organisation through the training of human
resources and the promotion of motivation, participation, responsibility and well-being. Training opportunities
and management have evolved in line with the company's values and leadership model as a strategic
element of growth and development. The development of skills is linked to the new corporate leadership
model, which, just as the performance assessment system, has identified core, functional and role-specific
competences and skills. The airport is a complex organisation, characterised by a multitude of activities
which are carried out by the staff of AdB and the organisations that work and/or provide services at the
airport. The Management Company is responsible for defining and ensuring high levels of safety, which must
be shared by every person, employee and third-party that operates or provides services at Bologna Airport.
As such, the Management Company establishes, guides and implements training programmes designed to
promote safety, including through awareness of roles and responsibility, and understanding of working
procedures.

Training Center

The Training Center was inaugurated on February 11, 2019. It is a both a physical facility and an organisational unit
responsible for training, created with the aim of centralising all the company’s specialist skills training (both technical
and managerial) under a global vision that guarantees a continuous synergy shared by all corporate areas. The
centre’s development involved an initial phase of strategic mapping of the various company roles and related training
needs. This was conducted through interviews with area managers aimed at developing customised and tailor-made
training for each role and the identification of the skills required for each task. AdB’s personnel are closely supported
and supervised from the moment they join the company and throughout their corporate life. In order to manage and
monitor the timing of training objectives, a specific software application has been implemented that supports the
management of the company training system and the Training Center in the creation and management of an Annual
Training Plan. Every participant has an individual record updated following participation in training events both inside
and outside of the company.

The training procedure was updated to take into account the new training management following the creation of the
Training Center. Among the innovations in the training area is the Training Manual and its attachments (currently
being implemented), which describe the training courses for each role and are provided as part of computer software
and within the course syllabuses. With a view to continuously improving training activities, AdB collects feedback from
employees through satisfaction questionnaires. The Training Center uses both instructors from the TC staff and
internal trainers who, through their work in the various areas of the company, have gained sufficient knowledge of
their section of the airport, and who have subsequently gained training instructor skills by participating in specific
“Train the trainer” courses. Instructors and Trainers were formally appointed by the Training Manager, who is
responsible for management of the training system. The instructors organise and deliver initial and recurrent training
courses, oversee course content until assessment, calibrate the delivery of their training according to the type of user,
and develop and carry out both face-to-face and distance learning routes.

2019 saw the preparation of a first Annual Training Plan that integrated managerial and technical training -
often obligatory and valid for a limited time - with a comprehensive approach encompassing the entire year’s
training. It may be consulted by area, person, course and deadline. Training is divided into two skill macro-
areas: technical-operative, focused on a specific role and training path; and managerial, which centres
around the development of soft skills, individual coaching, and inter-departmental projects involving
management personnel. As regards managerial training, an important training project was carried out in
2019, financed by the Fondimpresa corporate training account “Project Management in Action”. This
involved 34 managers from the various company departments, and aimed to spread a common language
and set of principles among the Project Managers and their staff, and to create the right skills to effectively
manage projects in terms of planning, coordination activities and time and cost monitoring, using
standardised methods and best practices. This was followed by other, more vertical strategic pathways
focusing on sector-specific issues for Project Managers in the Airport Operations and Infrastructure
departments. An external expert led a strategic course on compliance with Regulation 139 for AdB
Assessors. These are the figures responsible for relevant work (e.g. Safety Managers, Compliance Manager,
Areas Managers), who identify and assess the skills and courses required for roles within their remits. They
are also responsible for the implementation, execution and update of proficiency checks (a type of checklist
