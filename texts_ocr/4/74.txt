2.7.2 Diversity and Equal Opportunity

Equal opportunities form an integral part of the overall strategy of AdB and of the company’s improvement
policies, with the aim of offering all employees equal professional opportunities and of removing all obstacles
to their professional development. In this regard, initiatives are developed in various contexts, as detailed
below.

Regarding equal gender opportunities, AdB boasts a strong female presence across all sectors, with the
exception of manual labour due to the specific nature of certain duties. Furthermore, thanks to performance-
related pay policies, AdB also guarantees equal opportunities through salary structuring. In particular,
compared with the European average of 16.3%, AdB registered a gender pay gap of less than 2%. In terms
of remuneration, AdB rewards employees’ efforts through variable bonuses and professional development
remuneration policies, with the aim of developing new skills, evaluating the remuneration paid and
comparing it for reference to market averages. In particular, the so-called ‘Hay Method’ has been used for
several years for an objective evaluation of importance of company roles, and the cross-checking of salary
data with that of the reference market.

CAPO D: the “Business Community for Equal Opportunities”

Since June 2019, the Group has been part of the “Capo D” network, which brings together some of
Bologna’s most active and relevant companies in the areas of welfare, equal opportunities and
organisational well-being. The result is a true Community of Businesses for Equal Opportunities, united NS
in close collaboration with the region’s public institutions (Metropolitan City and the Municipality of
Bologna).

The new organisation was established with the signing of a network contract (which will last 15 years, until December
31, 2034), which guarantees commitment to the following strategic objectives:

1. Ensure that focus remains high on issues of equal opportunities as an essential part of the companies’
mission statements;

2. Create opportunities for dialogue and constant learning by developing services that foster organisational
well-being and corporate welfare offers;

3. Encourage networking, incentivise exchange, and create synergies between companies through shared
values and the adoption of good practices;

4. Cultivate (including through the use of a recognisable logo) the image of a company that is “sensitive” to the
issues of equal opportunities in the workplace, of a healthy work-life balance, of corporate welfare and
organisational well-being, raising local awareness of these topics both through CSR and the gradual
involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises;

5. Promote awareness of equal opportunities by increasing the competitiveness and innovative ability of
participants by organising conferences, meetings and open house events;

6. Collaborate with other organisations in research, innovation and study programmes, especially in the fields of
equal opportunities and worker motivation;

7. Facilitate participants’ access to common funds, whether regional or national, tenders, fiscal and financial
support, and other contributions and loans in general, identified as needs require by the Common Body. This
Body is composed and operates as per Article 10, and in full compliance with anti-money laundering
regulations, as well as the 231 Codes of Conduct and any internal procedures or policies of the individual
participants, as and where relevant.

This entire process is designed to create a collective system of businesses to train and improve the knowledge of their
workers, and to create awareness of career growth possibilities for those who have traditionally been disadvantaged,
