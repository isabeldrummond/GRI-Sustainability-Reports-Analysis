A NEW GENETIC TEST
FOR AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) include
a series of early onset neuro-develop-
mental disorders characterised by impaired
social skills, such as learning to play with
others, communication problems and repeti-
tive behaviours. ASD is a common condition
(1 in 150), is usually diagnosed between two
and four years of age and seems to affect
more males than females (4:1). Scientific
studies show a general increase in the dia-
gnoses of autism and related syndromes,
which have more than doubled in the last
decade.

The cause of the onset of ASD is not yet
known, although current estimates attribute
equal weight to genetic and environmen-
tal factors. Genetic factors may involve
both new mutations, i.e. mutations that
have arisen in the affected subject but are
absent in the parents, and inherited muta-
tions. Genetic investigations in families with
at least two members with this condition
have identified a number of genes most
frequently associated with autism. Compa-
red to the tests used to date and limited to
the study of abnormalities of chromosome
regions in patients with ASD or intellectual
disabilities (e.g. aCGH), the sequencing of
the entire genome (WGS) has a conside-
ably higher diagnostic potential because
it is able to simultaneously search for DNA
alterations in all genes and relevant regions.

Personal Genomics, a SOL Group company
since 2017, certified UNI EN ISO 9001 and
SIGUCERT (certification issued by the Italian
Society of Human Genetics), operates as a
Medical Genetics Laboratory and aims
to provide genetic tests and services in the
world of research and clinical diagnosis. The
company has obtained institutional accre-

ditation from the Veneto Region, which will
allow the disbursement of its services on
behalf of the National Healthcare Service.

Personal Genomics recently developed a
genetic test for autism spectrum disor-
ders which is performed with a simple blo-
od draw. The test is based on sequencing
the entire genome using Next Generation
Sequencing (NGS) technology and bioinfor-
matics analysis targeting genes and chro-
mosomal regions currently associated with
autism spectrum disorders. The test allows
detecting both small sequence variations
(single nucleotide polymorphisms, small
insertions and deletions) and some large
chromosomal rearrangements (deletions
or duplications) based on the data in the
reference databases. In addition, post-test

 

analyses can be performed by looking in the
parent genome for the presence or absen-
ce of the same mutations detected in the
affected individual, to determine whether
they have been inherited or whether they
are new.

ASD diagnostics is increasingly referring
to genetics for the enormous potential it
offers. The result of the test, in addition to
helping to understand the causes of the di-
sorder, will greatly strengthen the molecular
knowledge of specific phenotypes of ASD
and also allow building a targeted and fami-
liar rehabilitation intervention.
