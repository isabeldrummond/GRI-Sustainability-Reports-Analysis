SOLGROUP

FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER

The development plan of the SOL Group focuses on continu-
al research into innovative technological solutions which,
through the use of technical gases, enable its customers to
pursue goals in the area of energy and production effi-
ciency, the improvement of environmental compatibility
and the protection of the health of their employees.

To achieve these objectives, the solutions offered to custom-
ers include, in addition to the supply of technical gases, the
most advanced gas application technologies, the construc-
tion of specific plants to be combined with customer pro-
cesses and the provision of the necessary maintenance and

technical assistance services. Gas application technologies
and related services are developed and constantly updated
by the Group's marketing services in response to customer
needs and specialised for multiple sectors of the environ-
ment and industry such as, for example, the food, metallur-
gical, chemical, pharmaceutical and petroleum industries.

The gases produced and distributed by SOL are: oxygen,
nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide,
acetylene, nitrous oxide, gas mixtures, high purity gases,
food gases, gaseous helium, liquid helium, gases for elec-
tronics, ammonia, combustible gases for industrial use and
liquefied natural gas (LNG).

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS: SOL'S
TECHNOLOGY AND KNOW-HOW
FOR CLEAN AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY

Thanks to its extensive experience and ex-
pertise in the production, transport, storage
and use of cryogenic gases, SOL has added
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to its list of
products, a clean and highly sustainable
energy solution.

Liquefied Natural Gas is a cryogenic fluid
obtained by purification and liquefaction of
the natural gas at about -160 °C. This makes
it possible to transport large quantities of
product through specific cryogenic tanks,
also at great distances from sources or in ar-
eas not reached by methane pipelines.

Gas combustion significantly reduces emis-
sions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants
such as SOx, NOx and fine dust compared
to conventional fuels, proving to be the best

solution currently available to limit the envi-
ronmental impact of heavy road transport
and maritime transport, as well as of the
industrial sector.

The SOL Group has been active in the LNG
sector from the moment its use began in
the transport sector. The Group is able to
develop and propose technologies, plants
and services that allow its efficient use, de-
signing and creating plants for the produc-
tion of thermal energy and energy efficiency
through cogeneration and refuelling sta-
tions for heavy (LNG truck) and light (gase-
ous methane car) traction.
