GENERATED AND
DISTRIBUTED VALUE

The direct economic value generated and distributed, ex-
pressed as the economic increase produced by the SOL
Group's activities and distributed to the main categories of
stakeholders, allows the Sustainability Report to be connect-
ed to the financial statements.

In 2019, the economic value generated for stakeholders was
406 million Euro, an increase of 37 million Euro compared
to 2018 (+10%). This amount was then distributed to stake-
holders as employee wages (human resources), returns on
loans granted (lenders), return on risk capital (shareholders),
taxes (state and institutions) and amortisation and non-dis-
tributed profits (company system).
