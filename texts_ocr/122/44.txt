CUSTOMERAND
PATIENT SATISFACTION

Customer and patient satisfaction is a priority for SOL and
must be monitored constantly, checking the quality of servi-
ce offered and identifying the areas for intervention with a
view to continuous improvement.

Their satisfaction is constantly kept under control thanks to
key performance indicator (KPIs) monitoring (customer
and patient complaints, response times to customer orders
and patient requests, etc.) in order to promptly activate the
necessary corrective actions.

In addition, in 2019 some Group companies carried out
ad hoc surveys which demonstrated very positive results.
In the industrial and medical sector, 355 customers were
involved in Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,
France, Greece, Ireland, Morocco, Slovenia and Turkey. In the
homecare sector, 1,401 patients were involved in Brazil, Ire-
land, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain and feedback was
collected from 1,780 patients in the UK alone.

VIVISOL, LEADER IN TECHNOLOGICAL

INNOVATION FOR ITS PATIENTS

Last November at the Aboutpharma Di-
gital Awards, Vivisol won an important
award dedicated to projects that enhance
the implementation of the digital sphere in
healthcare.

The award was given for the Resmon
project, which reflects the perfect synergy
of technology with high scientific content
and innovation with the home care provi-
der, the primary actor in the context of chro-
nic disease management.

Resmon Pro Diary allows the early identi-
fication of exacerbations in patients with
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and
the subsequent optimal management of
chronic disease. With remote home moni-
toring of patients with COPD, the Resmon
Pro Diary device can predict any worsening
of the disease, even before symptoms oc-
cur. This leads to the preventive treatment
of patients, and exacerbations and thus the
irreversible deterioration of their state of he-
alth are avoided.

Of the 261 projects presented in the 10
categories envisaged, for 370 total appli-
cations, Vivisol's project was awarded Best
Project in the HTA, Patient and Market
Access category in front of an audience
of representatives from the most important
Italian and international companies.

The selection was made by a jury of experts
from the world of industry, institutions, as-
sociations and universities (Confindustria,
Google, La Sapienza University, the Italian
Federation of Mutual Doctors, Federfarma,
the Italian Association of Clinical Engineers,
Cittadinanzattiva, the Italian Drug Agency).

The award took into account the impact
that the Resmon project has on the quality
of life of patients, also considering the co-
efficient of real innovation, effective imple-
mentation and usability.
