ISO 14001 (Environmental Management):
ISO 14001 is a guarantor of the precise control
of environmental aspects, reducing impact
and ensuring legislative compliance, aimed at
maintaining an Environmental Management
System.

ISO 22000 (Food Safety Management
Systems): the standard defined for the effective
control, improvement and development of food
safety management, for organisations that want
to ensure its safety.

ISO 27001 (Information security): the ISO
27001 standard defines the requirements for
establishing and coordinating an Information
Security Management System (logical, physical
and organisational security), with the aim

of protecting data and information from all
kinds of threats, guaranteeing their integrity,
confidentiality and availability.

ISO 50001 (Energy Management): standard
aimed at helping organisations improve their
energy performance, increasing energy efficiency
and reducing climate and environmental impact.

Sale equipment: technical/technological
equipment purchased from third parties and
supplied for use to customers as part of a service,
but destined to remain the property of SOL; for
example, mobile containers, cold converters, etc.

Policy (quality, safety, environment): general
principles and guidelines of an organisation,
formerly expressed by top management.

REACh: EC Regulation no. 1907/2006
(Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and
Restriction of Chemicals). Its main aim is to
improve the awareness of the dangers and risks
deriving from chemical substances, aiming to
ensure a high level of protection of human health
and the environment.

Mobile container: container for compressed,
liquid, dissolved and cryogenic gases used for
packaging products. Mobile containers are:
cylinders, drums, gas cylinders, cylinder bundles,
dewars, base units and portable units.

Residual mix: refers to the average primary
energy sources that were not intended for

a specific entity or to an end consumer. If a
consumer uses the power grid without having
purchased a GO certificate, he then has to use
the residual mix in the calculation of its footprint.
The Residual mix is calculated for each year and
country by organisations that are part of the
European E-Track program, such as RE-DISS.

Responsible Care: a voluntary program of

the world chemical industry based on the
implementation of principles and conduct
concerning the safety and health of employees
and environmental protection, and the
commitment to communicate the results
obtained aiming for continual, significant and
tangible improvement.

Food safety: hygienic - sanitary prevention, for
which food is subjected to strict controls that
ensure correct preparation in accordance with its
use and consumption, assuring its safety to the
consumer.

SIGUCERT: The SIGU (Italian Society of Human
Genetics) standard certifies the organisational,
operational, management and professional
requirements of Medical Genetics Laboratories to

maintaining active and well-defined quality,
safety and/or environmental policies.

Sustainability (see sustainable development)

Stakeholder: all categories of subjects, private or
public, individual or collective, internal or external,
that can influence the success of a business or
whose interests are involved in business decisions:
customers, suppliers, investors, local communities,
employees, unions, public administration, future
generations, etc.

Steam reforming: process in which methane
reacts with steam, in the presence of a catalyst,
to produce hydrogen and CO...

Primary storage: liquefied cryogenic gas
container filled directly by the production plant.

Secondary storage: liquefied cryogenic gas
container filled by tankers, normally installed in
secondary process units.

Sustainable development: the progress that
helps meet current economic, environmental
and social needs, consistent with the protection
of the environment and the free goods (non-
economic) of future generations.

Primary process units: units where gases are
produced from raw materials.

Secondary process units: units where gases are
conditioned and packaged, normally using gases
coming from primary process units, into their
physical form (which may be compressed gas

or cryogenic liquid) in the containers (cylinders,
cylinder bundles, drums or tanks) best suited

for distribution to end users. These units also
produce pure and high purity technical and
medicinal gas mixtures.
