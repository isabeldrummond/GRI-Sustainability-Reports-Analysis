58 PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY

 

TRAINING AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT

Employee training is an essential element for the Group,
which considers its people's skills as an enrichment and va-
lue to be safeguarded for operational excellence and the
achievement of company objectives.

With the specific intention of meeting the training needs of
each level and conveying a message of corporate involve-
ment and collaboration for staff growth, in 2019 the SOL
Group revised its Onboarding program, an initiative establi-
shed for new hires. In addition to bringing the new arrivals
into contact with all that is SOL, its history and the organi-
sation of its business, the activity offers first brief training
meetings (directed by the quality, health and safety and
regulatory affairs departments) and the opportunity to get
to know the function manager of each new hire. Starting
in 2019, the new hire project was organised according to
a timely scheduling system, updated every six months and
shared with the Board of Directors.

The SOL YOUth Academy project aimed at young talent
was launched in 2018 and successfully carried out in 2019
as well. The training school is entirely dedicated to employe-
es under the age of 35 and seeks to develop Project Ma-
nagement and Business Presentation skills through team
working, sharing and collaboration activities, with the aim
of identifying and training tomorrow's leaders. During 2019,
the organisational foundations were laid for SOL YOUth
Academy International, an international version of the
project that will be launched in 2020 and envisages the par-
ticipation of colleagues from different countries.

IMAGINE THE FUTURE
OF HOME CARE

With the aim of promoting and encouraging the specialisa-
tion of employees, SOL provides funding for specialisation
and qualifying study courses, allowing employees of any
age and level to pursue training suitable for their professio-
nal role.

In 2019, 71,821 total hours were devoted to training, recor-
ding an average of 17 hours per employee (16 in 2018).

The desire to maintain close contact with young graduates
and make itself a reference point has always pushed SOL to
cultivate partnerships with different universities over the
years. In particular, the Group interacts regularly with the
Politecnico di Milano thanks to frequent meetings throu-
ghout the year. Through these moments of contact with
students, SOL has the opportunity to make itself known and
to provide assessment, orientation and recruiting activities,
offering a fundamental service for young people. The Group
continues to provide training projects for the Collége des
Ingénieurs Italia, a management training institute, by ma-
king the skills and experiences of its people available. The
initiative is not limited to the sharing of specialised know-
how but lies in the opportunity to hire young talents stu-
dying to obtain their master’s Degrees after they complete
internships with the company lasting 6 months.

The project involved Vivisol's sales force in
a moment of reflection, led by an external
trainer, on how customers, patients, services,
competitors and technologies in home care
have changed in the last five years and how
they will change in the future.

At the end of the session, a “Once Upon a
Time" blog was created for internal use that
gathered all the different contributions and
some graphics that, thanks to the presence

of visual aids, synthesised the reflections of
the working day into posters.

The results of the day allowed the identifica-
tion of training gaps with respect to the new
market scenarios in order to create a skills
development path that will end in 2020.
