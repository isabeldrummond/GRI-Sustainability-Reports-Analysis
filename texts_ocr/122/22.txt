HOME CARE, PRESENCE
IN BRAZIL STRENGTHENED

Constantly assessing its opportunities for
international development, in 2019 the
SOL Group increased its presence in the
field of home care in Brazil through the
acquisition of 85% of P Par Partecipaco-
es, the holding company that controls the
companies Global Care Assistencia Do-
miciliar Ltda, Unit Care Servicos Medicos
Ltda and DN Global Homecare Ltda.

Each of these companies operates in the
field of home care, responding to the ne-
eds of specific target users. Unit care helps
paediatric patients, taking charge of
both home care and the subsequent phy-
sical and mental rehabilitation of the child

(always at home) after the treatments car-
ried out. Global Care and DN Global, on
the other hand, mainly treat adult patien-
ts in need of complex care, offering a wide
range of home care services such as pallia-
tive care, management of chronic problems
due to aggravated wounds, incontinence,
physiotherapy treatments, speech therapy.

The SOL Group therefore continues its
journey, making the expertise of Vivisol,
consolidated in Europe, a winning card that
confirms the Group as one of the main wor-
Id operators in Homecare.
