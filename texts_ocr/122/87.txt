THE GLOSSARY

Cylinder: container in steel or light alloy for
compressed, liquefied or dissolved gases.

Conditioning: a production operation that
consists in taking gas from a secondary storage
tank and compressing it in a gaseous or liquid
state and transferring it to mobile containers.
Conditioning also includes the sequence of
operations carried out on the containers from
when they arrive at the centre to the storage of
full containers ready for delivery.

Seveso Directive (2012/18/EU and later
modifications): European standard intended
to prevent and control the occurrence of major
accidents, through the identification of one’s
sites at risk.

It governs industrial activities that involve the
stocking and/or use of certain quantities of
dangerous substances.

Medical Device (DM): any instrument,
apparatus, equipment, machine, device, plant,
reagent in vitro or for calibration, computer
software, material or other similar or related
product for use, alone or in culmination, on
persons for one or more specific purposes

of diagnosis, prevention, control, therapy or
attenuation of an illness; for diagnosis, control,
therapy, attenuation or compensation of a
wound or handicap; for studying, substituting
or modifying anatomy or a physiological
process; for intervening on conception where
the main desired action in or on the human
body is not carried out with pharmacological or
immunological means or through metabolism,
but whose function can be aided by these
means.

EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit
Scheme): Regulation 761/2001 of the
European Community. A voluntary instrument
for implementing Community Environmental
Policy aimed at continually improving the
environmental performance of the companies
and businesses adopting it.

Dispenser: container with vacuum insulated
cavity to contain highly refrigerated liquefied
cryogenic gases characterized and composed
by interception, measurement and safety
instruments.

Air separation: process of separation, by
distillation, of gas components of the air,
obtaining liquid and gaseous products.

Medical gases: both gases intended to be
administered to the patient (such as medical
oxygen, oxygen 93%, nitrous of medical
nitrogen, medical air) and gases not intended for
administration but used for other purposes in the
processing of the same, such as air and nitrogen
for foods or surgical instruments.

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI): a multi-
stakeholder network instituted in 1997 and
made up of companies, NGOs, associations of
accountancy experts, business organisations
and other international stakeholders involved

in subjects relating to Corporate Social
Responsibility. GRI’s mission is to develop, supply
and promote global reference guidelines for

the drawing up of Sustainability Reports that
describe the economic, environmental and social
impacts that companies or organisations cause
with their activities.

Accident: unexpected event with potential
harmful effect to oneself, other people or third-
party objects.

Major accident: event such as a serious spill, fire
or explosion due to uncontrolled developments
in activities in the presence or use of dangerous
substances, that could cause grave danger for
human health or the environment.

Frequency index: ratio between the number
of accidents and hours worked multiplied by 1
million. It measures the frequency of accident
occurrence.

Severity index: ratio between days of absence
due to injury and hours worked multiplied by 1
million. It measures the severity of injuries.

Injury: undesired event in the workplace that
provokes bodily damage or objectively verifiable
illness.

IPPC (Integrated Pollution Prevention and
Control): Strategy instituted with European
Directive no. 75 of 24/11/2010 “Industrial
Emission Directive” (1.E.D.) for minimising the
pollution caused by various sources throughout
the EU. All types of installation listed in Appendix
1 of the Directive must obtain integrated
authorisation from the authorities of the various
countries. It is based on the premise that

the failure to adopt a common approach for
controlling emissions into air, water and terrain
could lead not to a reduction of pollution but to
its transfer from one compartment to another.

ISO 9001: Recognised standard for Quality
Management Systems which provides a
method and reference standards for running an
organisation in a smart and aware manner for
customer satisfaction.

OHSAS 18001/1SO 45001: English standard
specifying the requirements for a management
system for health and safety at work, in order to
enable organisations to provide safe and healthy
workplaces, preventing work-related injuries

and illnesses and proactively improving its
performance. The standard has been superseded
by the publication of the international standard
ISO 45001 which will definitely repeal it in

2021, the date on which the transition of the
management systems from OHSAS 18001 to
ISO 45001 will have to be completed.

ISO 13485 (Medical devices — quality
management systems): a standard specifically
aimed at companies operating in the medical
sector such as SOL, designed for those who apply
targeted quality controls to medical devices.
