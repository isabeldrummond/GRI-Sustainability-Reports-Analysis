BIOMETHER, THE SUSTAINABILITY
OF THE BIOMETHANE CHAIN

In 2019 the BioMether project was com-
pleted, an initiative co-financed by the LIFE+
program (EU financial instrument) and the
Emilia Romagna Region, created with the
aim of launching the biomethane supply
chain in the Emilia Romagna region. The
Biomether project was developed by SOL in
collaboration with ART-ER, CRPA Lab, IRETI,
IREN, IREN Smart Solutions and Herambi-
ente, which saw the creation of two pilot
plants with innovative biogas purification (or
upgrading) technology for the production of
biomethane for its introduction into the nat-
ural gas network and/or for use for autotrac-
tion.

Biomethane is a gas consisting mainly of
methane produced by the anaerobic
digestion of biomass, obtained by an up-
grading process that generates greenhouse
gas emissions 75%-200% lower than fossil fu-
els, proving to be a renewable source in line
with the EU 2020 targets.

Biomether's objective is to demonstrate the
technical feasibility and sustainability of the
production and use of biomethane thanks to
monitoring that will continue until 2022.

The project provided for the construction
of two plants in Ravenna and Roncoce-
si, which respectively produce biogas from
non-hazardous waste landfill and sewage
sludge. In particular the Ravenna plant, in
addition to being the first in Italy to produce
fuel for local public transport, is also the first
biomethane production plant from land-
fill biogas built in Italy. The plant consists
of two purification steps: the first, more “tradi-
tional” one in which the CO, present in the bi-
ogas is removed through the use of polymer
membranes, as also takes place in the Ron-
cocesi plant, while the second step is specific
for production plants of biomethane from
landfill biogas, called polishing, in which ni-
trogen, typically present in large quantities in
landfill biogases, is removed.

The biomethane obtained from the first
site will be used to power the buses of the
Ravenna public transport service, while
biomethane from the second site will supply
the IREN Group's methane vehicles and
two of the three Polo TGIs Volkswagen has
provided for product testing. The objective is
to demonstrate the sustainability of biome-
thane, given its low emissions and reduced
negative impact on air quality.

Each year the plants are able to produce
14,656 Sm3 of biomethane, saving 28.76
tCO, of carbon dioxide. The project is an im-
portant example of circular economy, where
acommonly considered waste product is pro-
moted to recyclable and sustainable resource.
SOL won the Responsible Care award in
2017 with this project.

With the final conference Biomethane in
Emilia-Romagna held on 27 September in
Bologna, the regional guidelines were pre-
sented, drafted by Biomether for the devel-
opment of the sector in the region.
