HOME DIALYSIS:

A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION

Chronic kidney disease (CRD) is one of
the world's main health problems, affecting
about 10% of its population. When the
proposed therapies are no longer effective
and the disease evolves to a terminal stage,
the proposed alternatives are dialysis and
kidney transplantation. As for dialysis, about
90% of patients are treated in hospital
facilities, resulting in high costs for the na-
tional healthcare system and a strong social
impact for patients.

On the other hand, there are several advan-
tages that derive from home therapy: mini-
misation of hospital admissions, creating
significant savings for the national health
system, customisation of care, guarante-
ed by services which can be adapted to the
needs of the patient and have a positive
impact on the patient's quality of life, no
longer forced to go to hospital.

To date, home dialysis services are divided
into haemodialysis treatment and peri-
toneal dialysis treatment. While the first
solution involves the extraction of the pa-
tient's blood for extracorporeal purification,
the second involves the introduction into
the peritoneal cavity of an exchange fluid
and exploits the patient's peritoneum as a
natural membrane (thin membrane that en-
velops the abdominal viscera), thus proving
to be a less invasive treatment.

Since 2019 Vivisol has offered haemodialy-
sis therapies at patients’ homes, provi-
ding a service ranging from the provision of
devices suitable for the house, to patient
assistance by competent technical health
personnel. Technological solutions for re-
mote patient monitoring and periodic
visits by healthcare professionals ensure the
effectiveness and safety of the therapeutic

model proposed. In addition, an efficient
logistics structure with widespread deploy-
ment in the territory coordinates home in-
terventions, making the service highly flexi-
ble and operational.

For peritoneal dialysis therapies, Vivisol
aims to provide the same complete and effi-
cient model of care, with the aim of encou-
faging treatments at home and improving
the quality of life of patients and their fami-
lies. It is in this spirit that the SOL Group has
decided to invest in companies dedicated to
the research and development of innovative
drugs, able to provide solutions to the major
causes of chronic end-stage renal failure.
