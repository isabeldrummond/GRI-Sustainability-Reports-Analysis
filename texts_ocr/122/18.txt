SUSTAINABILITY REPORT - SOL GROUP 17

 

DECENT WORK AND SAFE PRODUCT MANAGEMENT
oT eT

Sol uses reusable containers (such as cylinders, cylinder packs and dewars) for each service involving the
distribution of bottled products for a period of several years. Taking charge of the different phases of
use of the containers it owns, from filling and distribution to maintenance, the Group implements a real
“closed loop" system. Furthermore, seeing to the inspection, maintenance and testing aspects ensures
that all the safety and compliance requirements of the containers are guaranteed.

The safety of products is monitored both in the production phase and during transportation, right up to
the final professional user, using risk assessment processes.

The SOL Group takes part in national and international working groups on product safety matters in
order to stay constantly updated on the evolution of regulations and to be able to operate in harmony
with other companies in the sector.

The management of the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) of all substances and for all companies operating
in the European Union is centralised at the Monza headquarters. There are currently more than 4,000
available SDSs in 20 languages. All of the safety data sheets and all of the labels applied to mobile
containers conform to Regulation 1272/2008 (CLP - Classification, Labelling and Packaging), which
regards the European standardisation of the classification and labelling of hazardous substances and
preparations.

As regards REACh (Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals),
following the registration process of 6 substances marketed by SOL in 2018, SOL obtained registration
as Only Representative for the Albanian subsidiary in 2019.

Product traceability, and in particular for medical gas containers, provides information on their
location at any time in order to make timely withdrawal actions, in case flaws were found in the products
delivered.
