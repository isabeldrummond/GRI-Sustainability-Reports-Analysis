26 GOVERNANCE SYSTEM

 

RISK ANALYSIS

SOL Group's activities, products, services and supply chain,
as well as its commercial relations, are exposed to social and
environmental risks.

SOL Group adopts a risk mapping and assessment meth-
odology that assigns a relevance score to each risk according
to the impact assessment, the probability of occurrence and
the management system in place. The analysis of the con-
text in which SOL Group operates, including the expectations
of the Group’s main stakeholders, was a fundamental part
of the process.

The main risks regarding non-financial matters to which the
Group is exposed are the following:

Environmental matters: potential risks related to the elec-
tricity consumption of the Group's primary transformation
plants, potential risks related to direct and indirect green-
house gas emissions, potential risks related to outbound
logistics, with particular reference to road transport.

Social matters: potential risks related to compliance with
existing regulations regarding information to customers and
patients, risks related to the supply of products and services
that address customers’ needs, potential risks related to the
traceability of the origin of products and services, potential
risks regarding the suppliers of services in the home care sec-
tor and in general the management of social and environ-
mental risks along the supply chain, potential risks related to
the market and the respect for human rights, with particular
reference to the supply chain.

Employees’s related matters: potential risks related to em-
ployees’ health and safety and to compliance with legisla-
tion concerning occupational health and safety.

Compliance with laws and regulations matters: potential
risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including
the issue of bribery and corruption.

To face the potential risks identified, the company carried
out an assessment of the protections for each activity, of
any shortcomings to be remedied and changes for improve-
ment. For the identification of risks related to material issues
and the risk responses reference is made to the table in the
chapter “Materiality analysis”.

The Company Managers are coordinated by Central Quali-
ty, Safety and Regulatory Affairs Management and are the
governing bodies that oversee the main environmental,
health and safety risks.

Furthermore the Company Managers, supported by any
local or corporate designated functions, also oversee the
risks related to employees’ management and the issues
covered by the Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics, which
includes issues such as protecting the safety, health and
environment, respect for human rights and preventing and
combating corruption, applies to all those who come into
contact with the Group, including suppliers, partners and
customers.

The Group has activated processes and management sys-
tems in order to mitigate the most relevant risks, in order
to guarantee the correct control of the matters. In particular,
the Group’s units have obtained certifications such as ISO
9001, OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001, ISO 14001, ISO 50001,
ISO 13485, ISO 27001 and ISO 22000. Thanks to the new
requirements introduced by the standards ISO 9001 and
ISO 14001, a new risk analysis process was implemented in
relation to business activities and assessing opportunities.
The analysis included reference to the sustainability issues
that are relevant to the SOL Group, in particular the risks po-
tentially present in product production phases and service
delivery, as well as in business relationships. The assessment
was extended, where relevant, to the supply chain.

The Group has also adopted specific Policies signed by the

Chairman and by the General Managers containing the prin-

ciples that underlie the activities of the Group's companies,

in particular:

¢ Quality management policy of SOL Group companies;

¢ Food safety policy of SOL Group companies;

e Energy management policy of SOL Group companies

e Information security and business continuity
management policy of SOL Group companies;

e Safety and Environment principles of SOL Group
companies;

e Principles and values on which personnel policies are
based in SOL Group companies and the Social Media
Policy for the responsible use of social media.
