FINANCIAL DATA

During 2019, the technical gases sector showed sales
growth of 2.3% over the previous year, achieving sales to
third parties totalling 412.6 million Euro, with slightly increa-
sing volumes in all sectors of use.

The sales growth was more marked in other European coun-
tries than in Italy and was especially greater in the mecha-
nical engineering, food and chemical-pharmaceutical indu-
stries.

The hospital sector, on the other hand, has found stabili-
ty, with still-shrinking prices mainly due to policies to reduce
spending.

The home care business had significant growth (+14.3%
with sales to third parties totalling 491.7 million Euro) achie-
ved more in foreign countries, thanks to a continuous com-
mitment to the development of new products and services,
which flanks and complements the oxygen therapy activities.

Overall in the health sector, Group sales totalled 592 million
Euro, equal to 65.5% of total sales.

The adoption of the new IFRS16 accounting standard resul-
ted in lower lease costs of 14.5 million Euro, higher depre-
ciation of 13.9 million Euro, as well as higher net financial
charges of 0.9 million Euro.

In terms of costs, it should be noted that the gross operating
margin grew to 24.4 million Euro compared to 2018, equal
to 13%.

It should also be noted that, compared to 2018, there was
less energy production of hydroelectric plants due to low
rainfall, the end of the proceeds from the white certificates
related to previous investments for energy efficiency, a signi-
ficant increase in transport costs and electricity.

The operating result, without non-recurring charges, increa-
sed by 8.2 million Euro compared to 2018, equal to 9%.

The Group's net debt, net of debt for leases which were not
considered in 2018, decreased by 5.7 million Euro, even
against the technical investments and acquisitions made in
2019.

Indebtedness indices remain very solid, with the debt/equity
ratio of 0.50 and the cash flow cover reduced to 1.38.
