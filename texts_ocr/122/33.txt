Carbonic fertilisation with CO,; increase in
production and in quality and look of the
product
¢ Fumigation and pest control with CO, of
biological agricultural products for which
no chemical products, such as phosphine,
can be used
¢ Fish and mussle farming with O,; increase
in production and quality of the finished
product.
Cooling, flash freezing, cryogenic freezing,
10F with Lin o LCO,: improved quality
of frozen product, taste characteristics
maintained, better aesthetic aspect,
reduced freezing times and space saving.
Packaging in atmosphere modified with N,
and CO,; shelf life optimisation, improved
aesthetic aspect, freshness maintained
Transport at temperature controlled with
Lin or dry ice: safeguarding of freezing
chain to preserve quality of food and avoid
spread of bacteria
Gassing, pressing with nitrogen, water
dosage: plastic bottle weight reduction.

Technologies and solutions for:

 

METAL FABRICATION

Thermal treatments

Carbon and stainless steel processing

Aluminium and nonferrous metal
processing

e Automotive industry

Aeronautical and railway construction

* Boilers

Tools

Controlled protective and reactive
atmospheres with nitrogen and hydrogen
e Endothermic and exothermic atmospheres
with solmix controlled carbon potential
Keying with Lin: products made not using
heat but cold, limiting fuel consumption.
Lin soldering of electronic cards: reduced
waste and manual elimination of defective
cards, increasing production quality
Cutting and laser welding with nitrogen
and oxygen: increased productivity and
product quality

Oxy cutting and oxyacetylene welding,
Mig/Mag, Tig and plasma welding and
welders.

Gas distribution automation and plant:
reduced manual operations help reduce
risk of accidents

Pressure & fugitive tests with helium

and nitrogen: guarantees tightness of
components treated, reducing risks of
leakage of products, also toxic products,
from plant where they are used (e.g.
offshore oil wellhead valves).
