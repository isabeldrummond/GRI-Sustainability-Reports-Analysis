54 THE ENVIRONMENT

WASTEWATER PURIFICATION FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

The SOL Group has been active for many ye-
ars in the development of solutions to sup-
port the environment, thanks to the targe-
ted application of the properties of technical
gases to treat solid, liquid and aeriform
waste, which allows substantially reducing
the impact they have on the ecosystem.

An example of this is Ecojet technology ap-
plied to purification plants, which provides
for the introduction of pure oxygen in the
sewage treatment process known as “acti-
vated sludge”, where biodegradable pollu-
tants present in the wastewater are decom-
posed by biological oxidation. The supply
of oxygen greatly improves the treatment's
effectiveness.

In 2019 SOL also implemented Ecojet tech-
nology at the purification plant of a major
customer in the food sector which produ-
ces and packages fruit juices, beverages and
tomato puree.

The processing of fruit and vegetables requi-
res the use of large amounts of water which,
contaminated by the pollutants resulting
from the treatment, must be purified in a
special plant before being reintroduced into
the environment.

The solution provided by SOL has allowed
the customer to obtain maximum purifica-
tion performance from its plant, allowing
it to operate in respect of the environment
even during its most intense production pe-
tiods. In addition, the efficiency of the Ecojet
system in the rapid and easily controlled
delivery of pure oxygen into the activated
sludge tanks allows better management
of the energy resources of the purification
plant.
