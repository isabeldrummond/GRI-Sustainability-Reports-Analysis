 

was a great deal of focus on the Domestic Care sector in 2019. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the acquisition of the
majority of P PAR Partecipacoes opens up new interesting prospects in a great country like Brazil, but also
throughout South America. In Basel, Switzerland, the acquisition of Spitex Perspecta strengthens us in a
territory not far from the Canton of Geneva and that of Vaud, where Sitex already operates, with undoubted
synergies and new potential. In Germany, the acquisitions of Intensivservice Wanninger and Medtek
Medizintechnik, the latter in December 2018, reinforce the critical mass of our presence in one of the
largest and most important countries in Europe, where Vivisol companies are among the market leaders.

The Group has maintained a high level of attention to the health and safety of its 4,320 employees and the
environmental impact of its activities; it has also continued to invest in research and development, as shown
in the many numbers and examples shown on the following pages.

2020 is already proving to be a very difficult year, and increasingly so in the coming weeks and months, both
because of the uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic before it can be defeated and because of
the uncertainty about the state of our societies and economic systems in Europe and the world once the
emergency is overcome.

However, we are certain that if we, Italians and others, are able to fight together, united, if we are able to
respect the rules, to continue to do our duty, to commit ourselves with a sense of responsibility and dedica-
tion, our country, Europe and the world will be able and will successfully overcome this terrible situation more
toughened and stronger than before.

Surely this will happen for us, the women and men of SOL.
