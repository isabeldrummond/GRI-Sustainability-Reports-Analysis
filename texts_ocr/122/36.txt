Ambulance management services

Patient care begins from the moment they are transferred
to hospital. For this reason, SOL is able to provide ambulance
managers with medical and electromedical devices for their
vehicles, maintenance and safety verification services,
vehicle sanitisation services and structured and voluntary
staff training.

Monitoring services

SOL offers a complete range of services for environmen-
tal, particle, microbiological, microclimatic and specific
substance monitoring (e.g. anaesthetic gases in operating
environments), custom-designed for each type of room in
the hospital facility according to the actual risk of exposure
established by current regulations.

Design and development of biobanks

The service of designing and creating cryo-biological
rooms is aimed at public and private structures that carry
out scientific research, assisted reproduction and manip-
ulation for cell, tissue and organ transplants and need to
preserve their biological samples for long periods of time in
liquid nitrogen. Turnkey solutions are offered, including the
design, construction of premises, provision of all devices and
maintenance and training services.

Disaster Recovery

The Disaster Recovery service guarantees public and private
structures the transfer and conservation of precious
biological samples to cryobiological rooms owned by the
SOL Group in emergency situations. In particular, Cryolab,
the joint venture with Tor Vergata University of Rome, is
authorised by the Italian Ministry of Health and the Italian
National Transplant Centre for the long-term and disaster
recovery conservation of human gametes and blood.

Bioshipping

The Bioshipping service makes it possible to transport bio-
logical samples between health structures in complete-
ly safe and traceable conditions, with continuous temper-
ature monitoring.

This service is becoming increasingly popular and important
and is also used for delicate and often unique samples such
as gametes. Cryolab, in particular, is able to satisfy the relia-
bility and very high specialisation requirements established
by applicable regulations for Medically Assisted Procreation
structures.

Training services

Training in the safe use of medical gases, their contain-
ers and accessories is fundamental for the correct adminis-
tration and handling of products.

Training is provided through ECM courses, which can be
accredited upon the request of the customer. These can be
held both residentially and remotely in order to satisfy the
needs of structures and individual students.
