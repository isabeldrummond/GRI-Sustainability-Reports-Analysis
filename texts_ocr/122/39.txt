Telemedicine services

Vivisol has well-established experience in Telemedicine
services that allow the clinical contact person to remotely
monitor various parameters of the patient's clinical situa-
tion. Vivisol has developed an innovative home device, the
Resmon Pro Diary, which allows anticipating the onset of
exacerbations and complications of the Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and promptly intervening with
appropriate drug treatments, thus reducing hospitalisations
and related health costs. The device analyses the data than-
ks to a patented algorithm and sends it to the Vivisol teleme-
dicine platform equipped with an alert system that signals
the possible risk of exacerbation in progress.

Healthcare aids

Vivisol has extensive experience and great skills in the ma-
nagement and supply of healthcare aids, with which
it offers a service including delivery to the patient's home,
technical assistance, maintenance, sanitation, disinfection
and online software for the computerisation of data.

Thanks to the information technologies applied to overco-
me disabilities, Vivisol provides an alternative augmenta-
tive communication service that allows patients without
motor skills to have autonomous communication, including
through an eye pointer.
