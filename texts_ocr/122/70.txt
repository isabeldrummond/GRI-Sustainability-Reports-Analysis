IDENTIFICATION OF PRIORITY STAKEHOLDERS

AND MATERIAL ISSUES

The SOL Group believes that doing business in a sustaina-
ble way means creating value for all those involved in the
economic, environmental and social spheres. To do this, it is
necessary to take account of the opinions and expectations
of all of its stakeholders, because they guide the Group's ac-
tions and push it to improve on a continuous basis.

For this reason, we maintain open channels of communi-
cation with all those that can influence the decisions and
actions of the Group and whose actions and decisions can
be influenced by SOL.

The definition of the relevant aspects for the Group and its
stakeholders initially envisaged a comparison of material
issues with industry best practices. Subsequently, the issues
were shared with the General Managers of the SOL Group,
in conjunction with the context analysis update of the In-
tegrated Quality, Safety and Environmental Management
System.

The issues resulting as material from these analyses, which
were then shared with the Board of Directors of SOL Spa, are
summarised in the following graph.

The 2020 objective is to create a questionnaire to directly
collect the requests of the Group's main stakeholders: indic-

atively customers, suppliers, associations, employees, pa-
tients.
