In addition to the certifications listed in the table, the Pure

SEVESO DIRECTIVE

Because of the kind of gases they produce and the quan-
tities they stock, 22 Group plants fall into the field of appli-
cation of Directive 2012/18/EU (Seveso Directive). Directive
2012/18/EC makes it obligatory to adopt a specific safety
management system and, therefore, to be periodically
subjected to controls by the Authorities. Four checks were
conducted in 2019, all of which had successful outcomes.

INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS DIRECTIVE

Some Units of SOL Spa and SGP Srl fall under the field of ap-
plication of European Directive no. 75 of 24/11/2010, “Indu-
strial Emission Directive” (IED), which governs the granting,
renewal and review of Integrated Environmental Authorisa-
tions. The company has authorisations for its hydrogen (Ra-
venna), nitrous oxide (Cremona, Marcianise and Tilburg) and
acetylene (Ancona) production plants.
