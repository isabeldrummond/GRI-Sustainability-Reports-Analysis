CO, RECOVERY: AN EXAMPLE
OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY

Carbon dioxide is a gas with numerous ap-
plications in the industrial sector: from wa-
ter treatment to metal processing to food
processing, as well as for the cooling, free-
zing and transport of food. The sources of
this gas are natural underground deposits or
as a by-product of chemical and biological
processes.

For several years now, the SOL Group has
decided to invest in plants that recover
this gas from production processes, which
would otherwise be released into the
atmosphere. Thanks to SOL, this gas is in-
stead recovered, purified and marketed in
liquid form.

Examples include the plants in Bulgaria
(Ihtiman) and Germany (Zeitz) that recover
CO, from bioethanol. These plants recove-
red 87,840 tonnes of CO, in 2019, which
would otherwise have been released into
the atmosphere.

In 2019 a consortium was created in Italy,
of which SOL holds 50%, for the recovery of
CO, from biogas generated by the anaero-
bic digestion of the organic fraction of mu-
nicipal solid waste (FORSU).
