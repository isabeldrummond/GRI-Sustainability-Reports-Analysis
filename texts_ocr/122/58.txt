collaborative environment that ensures adequate support for
balancing work with the needs of personal and family life, The
Group has 576 voluntary part-time positions in place, corre-
sponding to 13% of employees.

In the face of the Group's continued growth, the contribution
of young talent is considered a valuable and fundamental
resource for future development open to innovation, This led
to the entry of 777 employees in 2019, 30% of whom were
under 30 years of age.

The Group's overall turnover was 15%: lower in Italy (8%)
than abroad (18%), In particular, abroad has increased slight-
ly in relation to the different dynamics of the local and highly
competitive labour markets in which the Group operates and
the different composition of the workforce of each company.

The overall rate of absenteeism was 4% in 2019 but the
rates in Italy and abroad were quite different, In Italy, it came
to 2%, well below both the national average for the sector and
the average for industry as a whole, while abroad it was 5%,
with oscillations that are still in line with the average data of
each country.

In addition to these employees, the Group employs over 2,000

external collaborators for certain services provided to patients
at home, such as nurses, doctors and physiotherapists.
