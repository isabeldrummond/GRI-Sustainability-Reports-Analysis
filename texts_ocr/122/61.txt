SOLCONNECT, THE PLATFORM THAT
COMMUNICATES THE SOL WORLD

The new SOLConnect corporate intranet
was created in 2019, a communication pla-
tform of the SOL Group that has officially
been in place since 1 January 2020.

The system was built on a common infra-
structure with the aim of responding to the
characteristics and needs of the Group at
international level by assigning each user
the specific work area to which they belong,

agues from different SOL companies work to
keep the information in the main database
always relevant, complete and up to date,
taking advantage of the system as a col-
lective sharing desktop.

SOLConnect continues to be the source of
the Group's documents and information,
in particular for quality, safety and environ-
ment activities.

REMUNERATION AND INDUSTRIAL
RELATIONS

The SOL Group makes no distinction between the sexes in
the management of remuneration policies which are based
on merit, competences and results for each role.

Where required by local legislation in the countries in which
it operates, the SOL Group applies the collective contracts
for the relevant sector or, alternatively, salaries above the
minimum legal wage.

64.6% of the SOL Group’s employees are covered by collecti-
ve labour agreements, including 100% of Italian employees
and 50.7% of employees in other countries.

On average, wages and salaries, which are monitored by lo-
cal managers and Personnel and Legal Affairs Central Mana-
gement, are better than those of the market.

In 2019, the total remuneration paid to the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Aldo Fumagalli Romario was 14.31
times the average total remuneration of Group employees
in Italy. (1)

Every year, all managers are required to evaluate the per-
formance of their staff and to refer wage increase and/or
career development proposals to the relevant departments
and Personnel and Legal Affairs Central Management.

and reporting methods.

In any case, the salary increases established by collective
bargaining in the sector or by current legislation are guaran-
teed and where union representation is present, supplemen-
tary contracts are negotiated that can include production
and/or participation bonuses connected with corporate
productivity profitability parameters such as quality impro-
vement and injuries prevention.

Furthermore, the Group strives to promote tools that protect
the health of employees and their families, and those that
integrate the pension services established by local laws.

Personnel and Legal Affairs Central Management directly
manages industrial relations for all Italian companies in the
Group and supports overseas companies, intervening when
necessary.

SOL is an active member of the chemical industry confede-
ration (Federchimica) and takes part in negotiations in Italy
for the renewal of the chemical and chemical-pharmaceuti-
cal national collective labour agreements and in other joint
schemes by the social partners.

At corporate level SOL maintains periodic relations with its
unions based on the utmost cooperation and transparency.
No labour disputes occurred in any of the Group companies
