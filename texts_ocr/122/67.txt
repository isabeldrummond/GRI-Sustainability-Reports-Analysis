FINANCIAL COMMUNITY

The main communication tools for shareholders are the Fi-
nancial Statements and the Sustainability Report, published
respectively in the Investor Relations/Financial Publications
section and in the Sustainability/Sustainability Reports
section of the Group's website (www.solgroup.com).

For this reason, in addition to complying with legal obliga-
tions, the financial statements have been enriched, in parti-
cular in the sections “Explanatory notes" and "Management
report", with useful information for a better understanding
of the activities carried out.

PERFORMANCE ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE

(in Euro)

The communication activity with shareholders and investors
is also powered by:

1. the periodic publication of press releases on the Group's
website and their dissemination to institutional inve-
stors;

2. participation in conferences promoted by financial insti-
tutions;

3. meetings and conference calls with investors and analy-
sts.
