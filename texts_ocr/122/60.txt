PROTECTING DIVERSITY

SOL recognises diversity as a wealth and an opportunity for
self-discovery and acceptance of others; gender equality
and culture are common values in all the companies of the
Group.

The progressive extension of our activities in new countries
requires us to pay increasing attention to the national and
cultural differences present within the Group companies.
The SOL Group’s aim is to promote local resources at all le-
vels of the organisation, giving priority to local managers
and assigning control and monitoring tasks to central fun-
ctions.

The multiplicity and wealth of the SOL Group is clear when

considering the following indicators:

e 40% of employees are women. The presence of women,
slightly up compared to 2018, is more consistent among
white collar employees, accounting for 53%;

e SOL employees are distributed in the following age
groups: 20 years (12%), 30 years (34%) and 40 years
(30%), those over 50 represent 24% of the company
population.

Moreover, the number of women who sit on the Board of
Directors of parent company SOL Spa rose from five to six,
representing 55% of the 11 members.

INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS AND EN-
GAGEMENT

The SOL Group considers internal communication an impor-
tant support for the creation of corporate culture and the
growth of people and the organisation, encouraging and
promoting the exchange of information, knowledge and
experience.

The desire to inform and involve all people has led to the
adoption of different communication tools. First and fore-
most is the company’s house organ, SOL News, renewed in
2017 to reach the entire company population.

In this context, the company intranet SOLConnect also
plays a fundamental role, as it is full of useful information
not only for the correct management of the integrated ma-
nagement system procedures, but to allow everyone to be
an active part of company life as well, also thanks to the
news periodically published in reference to local and global
events.

Thematic newsletters are another way of communicating
with all colleagues: examples include Safety Alerts sent by
HSE Management and other corporate departments. Throu-
gh these periodic communications, SOL intends to provide
its people with the necessary tools to cope with new regula-
tions or to manage critical situations, starting from specific
events in the sector.

In 2019 Vivisol in Austria carried out a climate survey with
the aim of evaluating the strengths and areas of improve-
ment of the business climate. The results of the survey were
analysed and communicated to the employees involved,
and specific internal meetings were held to assess the data
and define any necessary improvement actions. In 2019
Vivisol Nederland implemented an intervention plan in re-
sponse to the areas of improvement that emerged from its
business climate survey carried out in 2018.

The objective for 2020 is to create a real HR Community
that brings together the HR Managers of the Group compa-
nies who, at an annual event, meet to share best practices
and define guidelines at Corporate level on the main issues
concerning human resources management.
