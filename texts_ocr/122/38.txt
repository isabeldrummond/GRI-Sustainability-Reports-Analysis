VIVISOL FOR HOME CARE ASSISTANCE

Vivisol has established itself in Italy, throughout Europe and
Brazil as one of the leading Home care Providers of techno-
logical and health services for complex therapies and often
life support for chronic patients.

In a demographic and epidemiological context characte-
tised by progressive population ageing and the increased
incidence of major chronic diseases, the role of Home care
Providers becomes increasingly relevant for the better ma-
nagement of chronic patients who often suffer from mul-
tiple conditions as well as fragility. In fact, adequate models
of home care provided by specialised providers have a po-
sitive impact both on the health and well-being of patients
and on the sustainability of different national healthcare
systems.

Vivisol has a widespread presence in all the countries in
which it operates thanks to a territorial network of Health
Service Centres and Operational Centres active 365 days a
year, 24 hours a day, from which home activities are coordi-
nated and managed for over 500,000 patients worldwide.

Respiratory therapies

Vivisol provides oxygen therapy services for patients with
respiratory failure, both at their home and in different pla-
ces, thanks to the ViviTravel service, designed to follow pa-
tients travelling throughout Europe.

Through partnerships with well-established global manu-
facturers, over the years Vivisol has used the best techno-
logies to guarantee the patient complete management of
respiratory therapy with invasive and non-invasive home
mechanical ventilation. Supporting ventilatory therapy, Vi-
visol assists the most complex patients who are often suffe-
ring from neuromuscular diseases, also with complementary
technologies and assistance including bronchoaspiration,
cough assistant, humidifier. Vivisol also carries out an aero-
sol therapy service, often used in the treatment of various
diseases thanks to its effects.

Vivisol is one of the leading companies in the market for the
diagnosis and treatment of respiratory sleep disorders.
Innovative diagnostic solutions and personalised therapeu-
tic care are supported by remote monitoring of patient sta-
tus to improve adherence to therapy.

Infusion therapies

To support patients requiring intravenous or subcutaneous
home drug therapy, together with industry experts Vivisol
has designed a series of dedicated services: services for ar-
tificial nutrition, for insulin therapy, for immunotherapy,
for the treatment of pain and for Parkinson's disease.

Each service involves a careful selection of the medical de-
vice by a highly specialised multidisciplinary team, training
the patient and their caregiver, on the use of the device,
the coordination of activities for the management of the
patient upon return from the hospital and the dietary and
nursing care dedicated to them, with the aim of ensuring
therapeutic continuity at home, in complete serenity.

Advanced Homecare

Vivisol provides home healthcare and social care services
for patients with temporary or chronic clinical needs through
medical, nursing and rehabilitation teams. The various he-
alth activities are managed by 24-hour Operations Centres
and on IT platforms that allow fluid communication betwe-
en Vivisol operators and the patient's clinical contact, thus
ensuring the reliability and efficiency of a system built on the
patient's needs. Vivisol has specific know-how in the mana-
gement of highly complex patients, who are guaranteed
the personalised care of their needs that integrates health
services with the management of life support technology.
Vivisol has a structured network of Palliative Care aimed at
patients with oncological and degenerative diseases for whi-
ch there are either no therapies or they are ineffective for a
significant prolongation of life. These benefits can be provi-
ded at the patient's home or in Hospice (as in Germany and
Poland). Vivisol also has specialised facilities such as clinics
dedicated to psychogeriatrics to assist the neuro-psychologi-
cal decay of elderly patients, and protected apartments for
people with complex disabilities which are designed accor-
ding to the clinical-care needs of the patient.
