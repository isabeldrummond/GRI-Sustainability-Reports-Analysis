24 GOVERNANCE SYSTEM

 

The SOL Group is also strongly committed to protecting and
respecting the principles of free market and competi-
tion. In 2017 a specific Antitrust Compliance Program
was adopted and the Antitrust Code and Handbook were
approved by the Board of Directors and disseminated, which
very simply and clearly explained the fundamental prin-
ciples of the legislation to be observed. These documents
have been translated into English, distributed to all Group
companies and been the subject of specific training sessions
dedicated to all recipients of the Program.

An Antitrust Function was also created, which is cov-
ered by the Legal Affairs Department for Italy and by the
Country Managers for the Group’s non-Italian companies.
It is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the
Antitrust program and providing assistance in this area to
everyone in the Group. Among its other duties, the Anti-
trust Function also organises training events to promote the
awareness and understanding of the regulation’s contents.

During 2018, also in light of the entry of the European Direc-
tive on the general data protection (the so-called “GDPR”)
into force, a DPO (Data Protection Officer) was appointed
in the countries where required by law and a Directive was
published, valid at Group level, which defines the basic rules
that all Group companies must know for the collection, pro-
cessing and management of personal data. After this, the

Group continued with a widespread training campaign, also
via distance learning, using the communication tools avail-
able. An audit of the Group's privacy management system
was carried out by an external company in 2019. The anal-
ysis confirmed the substantial adequacy of the SOL Privacy
Management System to the EU Regulation and identified
those areas of improvement that will be implemented dur-
ing 2020.

The systematic monitoring of the correct application of the
corporate governance principles takes place via a system
that involves the presence of dedicated company structures
which carry out monitoring, control and risk management
activities of company risks.

The Board of Directors of parent company SOL Spa has
created the Internal Control Function that responds to
it, which is tasked with ensuring that internal operating and
administrative procedures are correctly respected. The Inter-
nal Control Function reports directly to the Board of Direc-
tors. Verification activities are performed both at the man-
agement offices of the Monza headquarters and at the sites
of the Group’s operating companies. The internal control
function makes use of the structures and personnel included
in the various Departments, assigning them with control and
risk assessment tasks.

GOVERNANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY

Sustainability has been central to the SOL Group's strategy
since its establishment. The approach adopted by the Group
integrates sustainability into the planning and control sys-
tems and therefore into the management of the functions
related to the economic activities managed.

On 28 November 2016 the Corporate Social Responsi-
bility (CSR) Committee was set up with Directors, General
managers and Central managers appointed as its members.
The CSR Committee validates the sustainability goals, coor-
dinates, and stimulates the operating structures of all of the
Group's companies.

For 11 years now, the SOL Group has chosen to communi-
cate its economic, environmental and social performance
with the Sustainability Report. The 2018 Sustainability
Report was chosen from 800 reports and awarded by the

committee of the ConsumerLab.it association for its clarity
and communicative effectiveness that demonstrates SOL's
sensitivity and attention in involving stakeholders in sustain-
able matters.

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

The SOL Group has chosen to organise its Quality, Safety
and Environmental Management System in an integrated
way in order to guarantee coverage of all its activities, em-
phasising synergies.

The governance of the Management systems, the re-exam-
ination of their proper functioning and the verification of
their effectiveness is entrusted to the Quality, Safety and
