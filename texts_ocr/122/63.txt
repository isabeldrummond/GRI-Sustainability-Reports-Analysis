62 PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY

 

COMMITMENT TO THE
COMMUNITY

For two years now, the SOL Group has been working to of-
fer a work-school alternation path, signing an agreement
with Paolo Frisi Scientific High School in Monza. Starting
in June, five students were given the opportunity to work
alongside a company tutor to have an internal perspective
on work in the company.

The SOL Group has always supported bodies, institutions,
associations and sports clubs that operate in harmony with
its values, making financial contributions and offering them
the benefit of its expertise.

In Italy, the SOL Group provided its support to the La Meri-
diana Cooperative in Monza this year as well, promoting the
SLAncio project which provides people affected by invalida-
ting neurological and neuromuscular diseases with assistan-
ce, and the II Paese Ritrovato project, a small village wi-
thout architectural barriers designed for the free movement
of people with dementia.

Vivisol actively supports research by funding grants and
scholarships in favour of different medical hospitals, such
as the Institute of Biomedicine and Molecular Immu-
nology of Palermo, which carries out important outpatient
medical and welfare activities in the diagnosis and therapy
of bronchopulmonary diseases, and the Medicine Depart-
ment of the University of Rome, for which a contribution
for neurological research has been granted.

Vivisol has also renewed its support to the Anna Meyer Pa-
ediatric Hospital Foundation for a project for the creation
of a database of paediatric patients undergoing long-term
home ventilation, and to the ANT Italia Foundation which
provides specialist home medical care services to cancer pa-
tients free of charge.

Several contributions were made in the specific field of
pneumology in favour of university hospital centres such as
Sant'Orsola General Hospital in Bologna for the develop-
ment and implementation of the sleep laboratory, and Mo-
linette Presidium in Turin for respiratory physiotherapy.

This year the SOL Group also participated in the 19th edition
of the Milan Marathon, the event in support of ViviDown
Onlus. The company took part in the relay event with its two
teams, SOL and Vivisol.

In France Vivisol France, France Oxygen and MBAR suppor-
ted organisations for clinical research into respiratory illnes-
ses. In addition to supporting various associations in the
Netherlands, Vivisol sponsored the Villa Pardoes Winter
Run 2019, a charitable race, which also had Group employe-
es participate.
