THE SOL GROUP FOR HEALTHCARE

SOL

SOLGROUP,

SOL FOR THE HOSPITAL SECTOR

The new healthcare and therapeutic protocols require scien-
tifically and technologically updated products, services and
devices, which allow obtaining the best performance and
the best possible therapeutic result.

The SOL Group therefore acts as a partner for the supply
of products, services and equipment, allowing the health-
care system to focus on its core business of delivering the
“health” product to a very particular customer - the patient.

Design and development of medical devices

The SOL Group designs, manufactures and manages
Medical Devices such as centralised plants for the pro-
duction and distribution of medical gases, endocavitary as-
piration and the evacuation of anaesthetic gases; devices
for the administration of drugs, devices for the emergency
management of gases; accessories and consumable mate-
rials for the administration of drugs and the use of gases.

In this context, SOL has accredited its own mobile labora-
tory for verifying the quality of the medical gases ad-
ministered at the terminal distribution units.

 

Total Gas Management services

The Total Gas Management (TGM) service offers healthcare
structures the possibility of optimising the supply, man-
agement and maintenance of medical gas packs and
tanks, as well as medical devices and related systems.
The service is designed on a case by case basis in order to
satisfy the requirements of different organisational models.

The SOL Group uses the web platform InfoHealth® SOLu-
tion to manage the traceability of medical gas packages
and mobile medical devices, supplies and stock, the ordi-
nary and extraordinary maintenance of medical devices
(including electromedical equipment) and plant technology.
Validated according to Good Manufacturing Practices, the
platform guarantees traceability, contributing to patient
safety.

Preparation and distribution of
antineoplastic drugs

The focus on healthcare worker safety is a priority also
in the design and construction of laboratories for handling
antineoplastic drugs, where personal exposure to hazardous
chemicals must be kept under strict critical thresholds. The
adoption of the latest technologies ensures accuracy in the
dosages of therapies and eliminates the risk of potential
handling errors, thus ensuring maximum safety for the pa-
tient.

Electromedical equipment management
services

SOL acts as a partner for the routine management and
operation management of electromedical equipment,
from the simplest devices to diagnostics for life-saving ther-
apies.

Sanitising services

SOL offers specialised hygiene programs that meet the
needs of public and private users: from the design, develop-
ment and operation of surgical iron sterilisation plants and
water and air treatment and sanitation systems, to the pro-
vision of customised integrated services for the sanitisation
of industrial and civil environments.
