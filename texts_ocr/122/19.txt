The maintenance and testing of cylinders
and cylinder packs are very critical phases,
as they can have an impact on the safety
of the end user (customer) and all operators
who manage the production and distribu-
tion phases of the containers, and on the
quality of the product contained therein
(the containers are used in the industrial
sectors, in the food sector, in laboratories
for pure gases and for medicinal gases and
medical devices). The use of gases can save
lives and the cylinder containing them must
always ensure maximum reliability and
safety.

The new SOL Testing Centre arises from
the need to internally manage the testing
and maintenance activities of cylinders for
compressed and liquefied gases hitherto en-
trusted mainly to qualified external testing
centres in outsourcing.

The Centre covers over 22,000 square me-
tres and is located in Pignataro Maggiore,
in the Campania Region (Italy). It is able

 

to process more than 60,000 cylinders
and 1,000 packs annually with a single
work shift. It is a centre of excellence cur-
rently able to manage cylinders and packs
throughout the Group.

The Centre's design was guided by high
standards of quality, technological inno-
vation, safety and efficiency.

A management software (Supervisor) has
been implemented, to which all the ma-
chines are connected throughout the pro-
duction process: valve functionality check,
automatic measurement of the physical pa-
rameters of the cylinder, internal inspection,
sandblasting, hydraulic testing, painting. The
system allows organising, planning pro-
duction, tracking and processing data:
each operation performed is recorded and
stored in a dedicated database, organised
into digital files for individual containers to
allow complete traceability and historicity
of the tests and processes performed.

Integrated and innovative control sys-
tems, combined with the automation
of numerous phases of the process which
reduce the manual handling of cylinders,
guarantee a high degree of safety of the
operating processes and the operators
themselves. In a standard maintenance or
testing process, an operator must handle
each individual cylinder on average between
12 and 15 times. Thanks to the high degree
of automation of the SOL Testing Centre,
the processing cycle involves only 4 manual
operations to safeguard operator safety.

The Centre's operators participated in an in-
tense, specific training plan, which includes
periodic refresher sessions. In 2019, more than
1,700 hours of training were provided, equal
to approximately 136 hours per employee.

In compliance with current legislation, the
processes have been verified and certified
by Certification Bodies specialised in the
manufacture and periodic review of trans-
portable pressure equipment (TPED).
