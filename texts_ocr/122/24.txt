CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE

The SOL Group's corporate governance and control system
refers directly to the central role of the Board of Directors of
the parent company SOL Spa.

The system is based on the concept of balance in the rep-
resentation and roles of the governing bodies, dialogue
with stakeholders and on transparency, both in relation
to the market and to internal procedures.

The SOL governance structure comprises the following
bodies: Board of Directors, Shareholders’ Meeting, Board of
Statutory Auditors and Independent Auditors.

The Board of Directors has the primary role of governing and
managing the company with the basic objective of creating
value for shareholders, in accordance with legislation and
the Group's mission and values.

The Board of Directors assesses all of the most significant
projects, including those relating to sustainability perfor-
mance.

The Board of Directors of the Company, at its meeting of
20 February 2020, examined the new version of the Code
of Conduct for listed companies promoted by Borsa Ital-
iana that was approved on 31 January 2020 (available on
the website www.borsaitaliana.it). With a leaner structure,
the new Code introduced, in particular, a greater ranking of
recommendations in relation to both the size of the issuing
company and the characteristics of its shareholders. There-
fore SOL Spa, which does not currently adhere to the Code
of Conduct for listed companies, has positively assessed the
changes and simplifications introduced and at its meeting
of 20.2.2020 the Board of Directors resolved to adhere to
the new Code of Conduct for listed companies starting from
the financial year beginning on 2021, January 1st.

THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

The internal control system is the set of principles, rules, pro-
cedures and standards aimed at monitoring and preventing
fraud against the Company and the market as well as to pre-
vent the commission of offences reflecting an apparent in-
terest or benefit of the company by either top management
or, more generally, all its employees, ensuring compliance
with laws in every area of the Company's and the Group's
activities based on the principles of fairness, transparency,
efficiency and reliability of corporate management.

The system is guided by the Code of Ethics and all internal
regulations and procedures, which constitute, as a set, the
integrated Quality, Safety and Environmental Management
System.

Furthermore, both SOL Spa and Vivisol Srl have adopted an
Organisation, Management and Control Model estab-
lished by Italian Legislative Decree no. 231/2001 and sub-
sequent amendments and additions, which forms an inte-
gral part of the internal control system. The Model of SOL
Spa was then also extended to Sol Gas Primari Srl, thereby
constituting a spin-off of the parent dedicated to primary
production.

Both SOL Spa and Vivisol Srl have formed their own Super-
visory Bodies which have the necessary independence to
verify compliance with the Organisation, Management and
Control Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree no.
231/2001 and, more generally, respect for the Code of Eth-
ics.

The Organisation, Management and Control Models, first
drafted in 2006, were most recently revised at the end of
2018, with a major revision and simplification of the text
that took account of the experience gained over ten years,
both in the evolution of corporate organisation and consid-
ering regulatory and jurisprudential updates. The Code of
Ethics now implemented by almost all Group companies in
Italy and abroad was also updated and expanded in 2017.

During 2019, training sessions were organised for SOL and
Vivisol employees to ensure the dissemination of the prin-
ciples and behaviours defined within the Model and to il-
lustrate the main changes introduced. Further innovations
in the field of crimes falling within the category of those
required for the purposes of Italian Legislative Decree 231
were analysed for a future updating of the Model.
