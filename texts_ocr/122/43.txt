ENERGY PRODUCTION

FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES SECTOR

'SOLGROUP,

The production of technical gases is highly dependent on
electricity, which is mostly produced from fossil fuels like gas,
coal and oil that have a considerable negative impact on the
environment.

One of the objectives the SOL Group has pursued since 2002
is the production of electricity from renewable sources in
order to mitigate the indirect environmental impact of its
activities.

To date, the Group has 16 Group plants with a total installed
capacity of 31 MW, located in Slovenia, Albania, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and North Macedonia.

It can be estimated that 29,577 tonnes of CO, equiva-
lent emissions in the atmosphere were avoided in 2019
thanks to the generation of electricity in the Group’s power
plants (35,091 tonnes of CO, equivalent in 2018).
