INFOHEALTH®:

CLINICAL ENGINEERING

JUST A CLICK AWAY

Aware of the importance of maintaining
biomedical technologies within a healthcare
facility, SOL has proposed a range of
modular and flexible solutions with the aim
of managing, in an integrated manner,
the entire biomedical technology park at
all stages of the life cycle of each piece of
equipment.

InfoHealth® software was created with the
precise aim of making the technical and
economic administration of medical de-
vices more efficient. The ability to remote-
ly control instrumentation and technical
equipment through registries, to manage
intervention requests and the scheduling of
maintenance and certification interventions

allows keeping the status of the instru-
ments under control, also optimising the
costs of devices maintenance.

InfoHealth® is a simple and intuitive plat-
form that can be used by different users
thanks to personalised registration and ac-
cess systems. The system interface changes
according to the user's role and needs, pre-
senting specially enabled functions.

The platform is completely web-based, is
accessible through the main browsers and
designed to be easily accessible via smart-
phones or tablets.

Every single access is recorded as well as
every action carried out by individual users,
ensuring the traceability and history of all
data.

In 2019 a Disaster Recovery solution was
developed that, in addition to normal sys-
tem backup operations, ensures the full
availability of data and continuity of service
in the event of unforeseen events or inter-
ruptions in the primary Data Center.

The continuous development and updat-
ing of the Infohealth® platform is possible
thanks to the skills of SOL, Tesi and Revi, the
Group companies operating in the specific
field of clinical engineering.
