 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT - SOL GROUP

47

 

MAIN
ENVIRONMENTAL
ASPECTS

Electricity consumption in production plants and the distribution of products to customers,
hospitals and patients are the most significant environmental aspects for the SOL Group.

The activities of the SOL Group have a fairly limited impact on biodiversity as the production units are

relatively small and located in industrial areas.

Furthermore, the substances produced ad handled by the SOL Group do not pose a contamination

risk to the soil and subsoil. Some units have been constructed in locations that have soil and groun-
dwater contamination problems, but these have other causes and pre-dated the arrival of SOL.

 

 

 

 

The table shows the raw materials used for the main types of production units and the environmental
aspects connected to these activities.
The environmental data presented in this Report refer to the types of plants listed below, unless
otherwise indicated.

NaOH) are used for the purification of
nitrous oxide.

 

ACETYLENE PRODUCTION 4
PLANTS

These use calcium carbide as a raw
material, a solid that decomposes in water.

One by-product of this process is calcium
hydroxide which, where possible, is used in
industry or agriculture. Otherwise the lime
is disposed of as waste.

 

PLANTS FOR PURIFYING 6
AND LIQUEFYING CARBON
DIOXIDE

The raw material is carbon dioxide itself,
obtained as a by-product from chemical
plants or from natural underground
deposits. The carbon dioxide is purified and
liquefied with the use of energy.

CO, production plants can emit the gas
produced (greenhouse gas) from their
vents.

On the other hand, the carbon dioxide
obtained in this way is reused in industrial
applications instead of being emitted
directly into the atmosphere.
