HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Group has always put the health and safety of its pe-
ople first and continues to consider it one of its priorities.
Consequently, this issue represents a fundamental aspect
of the management of the theme of sustainability for SOL
and contributes to the Group's operational excellence: at
the heart of the strategy, there are the constant commit-
ment of all, training, reporting and analysis of accidents and
near misses and the sharing of experiences throughout the
Group.

Employee training is absolutely essential: all employees are
involved in constant awareness and training activities ai-
med at reducing the possible risks and ensuring high levels.
of workplace safety. To this end, periodic meetings are orga-
nised, also with the contribution of external specialists, to
enhance expertise and to stimulate collaboration between
units and share management methods.

A training project has been launched in Italy which is dedi-
cated to Safety Executives, Supervisors and collaborators in
the country, called "Safety Fridays”. The course was provi-
ded by the Group's HSE Management in Distance Learning
mode and addressed select topics based on elements that
emerged during audits, inspections or requests from partici-
pants requiring further attention.

8 sessions were organised in 2019, with 282 total partici-
pants and 398 hours of training provided.

The project feedback was very positive, so much so that it
will be proposed again in 2020 with some innovations: in-

volvement of other company functions as teachers, and
provision of the course in Italian and English to extend this
mode of training and updating in all countries where the
Group is present.

2019 also offered other important occasions for discussion
and to share experiences and best practices regarding the
environment, health and safety issues, especially the annual
meeting of the SERP (Safety and Environment Referen-
ce Person) managers, as well as the meeting for all ASPPs
(Prevention and Protection Service Officers).

The SOL Group has various specific communication tools:
these include “Safety alerts” which highlight events that
have taken place in the sector, urging employees to respect
correct rules of conduct, and “Quarterly Accident Reports”
which explain and analyse accidents that have occurred in
the Group and in other companies in the sector that belong
to Assogastecnici and EIGA.

The Group's injury rate (IR) and severity index (SI) improved
in 2019. The injuries that occurred were mainly due to trips
and slips that caused a high number of days of absence.

In 2019 the “zero accidents’ goal was met by 85% of the
companies in Italy and 81% of the companies abroad. Fur-
thermore, there were no cases of occupational disease.

Only injuries that led to at least one day of absence from work, excluding the day of the event, and which were strictly connected with production, logistics and office activities were considered.
