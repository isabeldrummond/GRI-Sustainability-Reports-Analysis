GREENHOUSE GAS
EMISSIONS

The SOL Group's emissions can be separated into:

e direct emissions from its production plants;

e indirect emissions deriving from the consumption of
electricity by the primary production plants;

e direct emissions connected with deliveries to custo-
mers and patients.

Furthermore, the emissions avoided thanks to the installa-
tion of technical gases self-production plants, called “on-si-
te plants”, at customers’ premises have been calculated.
This solution, where the characteristics of the gas and the
customer's needs allow it, represents an alternative to the
traditional supply of cylinders or liquefied cryogenic gas whi-
ch takes place via road transport. This implies a benefit from
an environmental perspective, as on-site plants have lower
specific energy consumption compared to centralised pro-
duction plants, furthermore, emissions due to road transport
are avoided. In 2019, the carbon dioxide emissions avoided
totalled 48,633 tonnes of CO, equivalent.

Direct emissions “"

@ Indirect emissions from electricity procurement

 

Direct emissions

The direct emissions of greenhouse gases are due to:

e carbon dioxide: a by-product in plants producing hydro-
gen through the steam reforming of methane, emitted
in plants producing CO, or vented during the dry ice pro-
duction process;

e nitrous oxide: emitted from plants producing N20 from
ammonium nitrate;

e HFC (hydrofluorocarbons): used in plant refrigeration cir-
cuits.

Direct emissions decreased mainly due to a lower restora-

tion of Fgas in the plant process refrigeration circuits and
lower emissions in the nitrous oxide bottling process.
