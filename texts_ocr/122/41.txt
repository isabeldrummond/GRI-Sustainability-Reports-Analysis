Genomic diagnostics

Personal Genomics, the genetics laboratory accredited
by the Veneto Region and certified by SIGUCERT, provides
pre- and post-natal diagnostic screening services which are
important for ensuring the correct development of new-
born babies, as they allow the early diagnosis of numerous
diseases which, if diagnosed in time, can be treated. These
activities are joined by genetic and bioinformatic analyses
which make Next Generation Sequencing technologies and
advanced bioinformatic tools available to preventive and
precision medicine.

Diatheva develops innovative diagnostic systems which
allow identification and quantification using DNA amplifi-
cation techniques of pathogens in any matrix and for any
requirements. Compared with traditional techniques such
as cultures, the new Diatheva systems can reduce the time
required to obtain results to just a few hours and are aimed
principally at the food and environmental control sectors
where fast analytical results are critical for making decisions
that affect the safety of people and the environment.

Biotechnology and biomedical research and
applications

Diatheva is focused on the research, development, pro-
duction and marketing of new and innovative products
(such as monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, mo-
lecular kits) for research, diagnosis and clinical application
in the hospital, environmental, veterinary and food sectors,
with a particular focus on the field of oncology, microbial
and viral infections and pharmacogenetics.

Diatheva aims to translate basic research results into indu-
strial applications in the biomedical and industrial fields by
cooperating with public and private companies and research
institutions.
