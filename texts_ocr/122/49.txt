ENERGY
CONSUMPTION

The SOL Group uses electricity, methane and steam as
energy vectors.

The Group's most significant environmental impact is the
electricity consumption in its primary production plants. In
fact, both the compression of gases and their liquefaction
are highly energy-intensive operations: it is estimated that
this consumption represents about 90% of the consumption
of the whole Group. In contrast, the methane and steam
consumption in primary production plants and the electri-
city consumption in secondary production plants and offices
are considered negligible.

In light of its highly energy-intensive activities, since 2002
the Group has invested in the production of energy from
renewable sources, acquiring 7 hydroelectric power plants
and constructing another 9 in Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina,
North Macedonia and Slovenia, for a total installed power of
around 31 MW. The electricity produced and sold on the grid
in 2019 was equal to 90 GWh, corresponding to 15% of the
Group's energy consumption.

The actions to reduce energy consumption include care in
the design and operation of production sites, process opti-
misation and renovation of plants, to which an important
percentage of investment budget is set aside each year.

Consumption is however considerably influenced by custo-
mer demand and the start-up (or shutdown) of production
plants.

In particular, the increase in consumption in 2019 is due to
an increase in production compared to a slight improvement
in the efficiency index because better performing plants
were in operation.

Currently the Group has not signed specific contracts for the supply of electric energy from renewable
sources.
