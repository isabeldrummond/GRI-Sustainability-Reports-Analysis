50 THE ENVIRONMENT

 

Indirect emissions

Starting with an analysis of the energy supply mix, the indi-
rect emissions generated by the production of the electricity
acquired by the SOL Group for its production plants were cal-
culated. These emissions came to around 281,310 tonnes
of CO, equivalent (calculated according to the “market-ba-
sed" method), higher than 2018 mainly due to the increase
in production.

Direct emissions from deliveries to customers and
patients

Starting from 2016, the monitoring of emissions as a result
of delivery activities was extended to all product types:

e products in tankers and tube trailers;

e products in mobile containers;

e home care products.

Attention to transportation is of fundamental importance
as regards environmental and safety aspects.

Products are distributed mainly by road and to an extremely
widespread customer base.

The chemical and physical characteristics of the main pro-
ducts also make it necessary to use special vehicles for tran-
sportation (heavily insulated tankers for cryogenic liquids) or
special containers (cylinders for compressed gases and base
units for liquid oxygen for home care use). In both cases, the
unfavourable ratio between the tare weight and the weight
of the transported products results in a low level of fuel con-
sumption efficiency per product unit sold.

Bearing these restrictions in mind, the SOL Group's actions
to reduce fuel consumption and therefore its environmental
impact have consisted of:

e developing production units spread as widely as possible
across the country in order to reduce the journey lengths
of vehicles;

e the periodical upgrading of the company fleet,
particularly with the purchase of next-generation heavily
insulated tankers, with a better ratio between the weight
of the transported product and the total weight;

e the adoption of logistics management methods aimed
at optimising routes.

Rainbow, the software for planning the distribution of liquid
products adopted and fine-tuned in 2012 for companies
operating in Italy, has gradually also been adopted by all of
the other companies.

 

A total of 91.3 million kilometres were travelled.

Based on the type of vehicle for the three main types of pro-
ducts transported, total forecast emissions came to around
53,000 tonnes of co, equivalent.
