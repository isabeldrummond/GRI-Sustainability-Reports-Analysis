LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

SUSTAINABILITY ALWAYS: EVEN IN THE PANDEMIC EMERGENCY

Traditionally this letter should comment, for the benefit of the reader, on the efforts that the SOL Group put
forth and the results it achieved in 2019, under the banner of and with respect to the values of sustainability
and social responsibility that inspire it. However, the emergency of these past few weeks that is disrupting
the world and the lives of all of us with the appearance and spread of COVID-19 is so serious that we cannot
fail to address it immediately. As we will see, moreover, we will always and regardless speak of sustainability.

First of all, we would like to thank our 4,320 collaborators, no one excluded, who are demonstrating a great
sense of responsibility, strength and will, dedication and civic spirit, and also great courage.

SOL is called upon, today in Italy but day after day more and more also in all the other countries in which it
operates, to ensure that medical oxygen, together with the systems for delivering and distributing it, reach-
es tens of hospitals and thousands of patients affected by the virus. This in a context in which the number
of patients in need of oxygen dramatically increases every day and the most involved hospitals have to be
able to deliver five to seven times more oxygen than normal. Without oxygen, many patients would have no
chance of surviving the disease.

At the same time, Vivisol is called upon to ensure that thousands of patients continue to receive life-saving
mechanical ventilation, enteral and parenteral nutrition, integrated home care assistance and oxygen ther-
apy at home every day, the latter also to combat the virus.

The Group's companies must also ensure that the hundreds of companies that continue to operate along
the chemical, pharmaceutical, food and water purification chains never lack the supply of our technical
gases and services, essential for them to continue to produce safely, for the benefit of our communities,
severely challenged by the quarantines and rules that have been imposed by the authorities in order to stop
the spread of the epidemic.

Of the 1,218 women and men of the Group in Italy, 550 are currently using agile working methods, work-
ing in shifts to oversee essential functions both at the headquarters in Monza and in the territorial locations.
But 668 of them continue to work in the primary plants and gas filling centres every day, visiting hospi-
tals daily for Total Gas Management services or the emergency installation of medical systems, going to
patients’ homes for Vivisol life-saving services, along with doctors and nurses, liquid oxygen and cylinder
transporters who have collaborated with us externally, often for many years. Lastly, others continue their
biotechnological research to help science defeat the virus.

All the other 3,102 international colleagues of the Group are gearing up to deal with probable similar emer-
gencies in their respective countries, also thanks to the pooling of experiences in Italy. Some of them have
already been hard at work in the trenches in these past few weeks.

Everyone has our gratitude and admiration for the decisive contribution they are making to the sustaina-
bility of our society, to allow Italy and all the other countries in which our Group operates to defeat the vi-
Tus and to rise again, to resume the path of development with stronger societies toughened up by adversity.

Meanwhile, in 2019 the SOL Group took a new positive step forwards on its development path. Turnover ex-
ceeded the threshold of 900 million Euro with 8.5% growth and high profitability. The growth was sustained
thanks to significant investments for 103.3 million Euro.

In addition to those for the purchase of tangible and intangible assets, considerable resources were also
devoted to strengthening the Group through partnerships and targeted acquisitions. In this sense, there
