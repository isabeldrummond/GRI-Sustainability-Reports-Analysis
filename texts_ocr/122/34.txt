« Components and equipment

Technologies and solutions for:

e EOR processes with nitrogen and CO2:
increased extraction productivity avoiding
the need for new wells

e Fluxing, pressurisation and stripping: plant
cleaning with reduced use of polluting
chemical additives.

© Controlled cooling with Lin: reduced plant
maintenance times, faster cooling and less
risk for operators.

 Inertisation and drying with nitrogen:
plant maintained in controlled stand-by,
limiting accident risks and permitting fast
restart

Cryogenic cooling with Lin: permits work
on filled pipes without need for emptying.

e Claus processes with oxygen: improved
and optimised recovery of sulphur from
refinery flows and lower emissions.

© Control and regulation of technical
and special gases, management and
maintenance of emission control units:
emission control units are kept efficient,
reducing the risks of accidental emissions.

e LNG Services: gas stations, cryogenic
equipment and LNG-powered trucks.

Waste Management

¢ Special waste management

Incineration

© Chemical, pharmaceutical, fabric and leather,
food, paper, petrochemical and extraction
industries.

Waste water treatment with O,: makes.
purification more effective and increases
purification capacity, reducing environmental
impact and giving better control.

Waste water treatment with ozone: reduction
of colour, micro contaminants, nitrates:
optimization of treatments, with reduced
environmental impact

 AOP processes with ozone: on-site
environmental clean-up, less removal of terrain
and combustion treatments having higher
environmental impact.

¢ Deodorising waste water with oxygen: reduced
environmental impact.

Disinfection with ozone: watercourses receiving
treated wastewater are protected from
bacterial pollution without the use of chlorine
compounds.

¢ Reduction of surplus sludge with oxygen:
less sludge to send for disposal, reduced
environmental impact.

* pH control with CO, this substitutes mineral
acids (sulphuric and hydrochloric) which leave
pollutants in the water.

 Recarbonation and remineralisation of drinking
water with CO,: makes water drinkable meeting
legal requirements using a certified food
additive.

* Oxy-combustion of waste with O,; reduction
of aeriform emissions and increased control
of incinerator plant with widely varying waste
loads (tourist areas).

 Afterbumers with O,: complete treatment of
emissions, limiting quantity and environmental
impact.

e VOC treatment and solvent recovery: reduced
environmental emissions and recovery of the
chemical products they contain.
