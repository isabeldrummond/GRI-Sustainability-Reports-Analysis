 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT - SOL GROUP

73

 

This document is the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement
(hereinafter also the "Sustainability Report"), drafted in com-
pliance with the Italian Legislative Decree no. 254/2016
and, as envisaged in Art. 5 of the aforementioned Decree,
constitutes a separate Report from the Management Re-
port. This document addresses the issues considered rele-
vant envisaged in Art. 3 and 4 of Italian Legislative Decree
no. 254/2016 with reference to the year 2019 (January
1 to December 31), to the extent necessary to ensure an
understanding of the Group's activity, its progress, its results
and the social and environmental impact produced by the
same.

The reporting scope of the Sustainability Report is the same
as the SOL Group's Consolidated Financial Statements as of
December 31%, 2019 (§ "Group Composition and scope of
consolidation” of the Consolidated Financial Statements).
In 2019 P Par Partecipacoes was acquired in Brazil, Inten-
sivservice Wanninger in Germany and Spitex Perspecta in
Switzerland.

For environmental data and information, see the chapter
“The environment”, which explains any eventual variations
in the scope of reporting, which do not limit the understan-
ding of the Group's activities or its impact.

The content of this Report refers to 2019 and, in particular,
the activities carried out by the SOL Group during the year,
unless otherwise noted. Data relating to previous years is
reported where possible for comparative purposes, making
it possible to assess longer-term trends in the Group’s activi-
ties. Restatements to previously published comparative data
are clearly indicated. Furthermore, in order to guarantee a
correct representation of the performance and reliability of
the data, estimates have been limited as much as possible.
Where estimates were used, they were based on the best
available methodologies and suitably indicated.

The Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance
with the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Re-
porting Standards: Core option defined in 2016 by the
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Regarding the specific
standards GRI 403 (Occupational Health and Safety) and
GRI 303 (Water and Effluents), the latest version of 2018
was adopted.

The information contained in the Report refers to issues
identified as material and the related indicators that reflect
the significant economic, environmental and social impacts
of the organisation or that could substantially influence
the evaluations and decisions of the Group's stakeholders.
The materiality analysis updated in 2019 and shared with
the Board of Directors of SOL Spa served as a guideline for
defining the content to report, in line with the expectations

of stakeholders. During 2020, the stakeholder engagement
process will be expanded, creating a questionnaire that will
be sent to the Group's main stakeholders.

The emissions aspect, within the topic of the environmental
impact of production, was significant only in terms of CO,
emissions. It should be noted, however, that with regard to
other emissions, some production plants hold an Integrated
Environmental Authorisation. The Authorisation provides for
the monitoring of emissions of NOx, VOC, NH3 and CO into
the atmosphere and the annual notification of the same to
the Competent Authority. There were no out of bounds in
the reporting period.

The SOL Group has published an annual Sustainability Re-
port since 2009. This Sustainability Report was approved by
the SOL Spa Board of Directors on 27 March 2020.

The Report was subject to a limited assurance engage-
ment according to the criteria set out by the ISAE 3000 Re-
vised principle. This engagement was carried out by Deloitte
& Touche S.p.A. which, at the end of the work performed,
issued a specific report with regard to the compliance of the
information provided in the Consolidated Non-Financial Sta-
tement prepared by SOL Group as required by Italian Legi-
slative Decree no. 254/2016.

The Group has envisaged a continuous improvement pro-
cess with regard to material sustainability issues in order to
comply in an increasingly virtuous way with regulations and
best practices in the sector. More specifically, with regard to
the theme of respecting human rights, in 2006 the Group
adopted a Code of Ethics (updated in 2017) which has
specific provisions on human rights issues. In fact, the SOL
Group undertakes to support the protection and defence of
human rights according to the principles laid down by the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), and acknow-
ledges the principles established by the basic Conventions
of the ILO (International Labour Organisation). The Code
of Ethics applies to everyone who carries out work for the
SOL Group (including all employees, interns, agency staff)
and administrators of SOL Group companies. The Code of
Ethics also applies to all those who, in various capacities,
come in contact with the Group (such as suppliers, partners,
customers etc.). During 2018, given the importance of in-
creasingly monitoring the supply chain, the Group adopted
a new directive valid for all Group companies in relation to
the supplier assessment process in terms of risk analysis,
including aspects related to human rights. Several training
sessions were organised in 2019 for the Quality Managers
of all Group companies.

The Group will continue its commitment to the analysis and
reconciliation of SOL's activities and priorities and the SDGs.
