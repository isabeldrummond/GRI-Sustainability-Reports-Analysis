SUSTAINABILITY REPORT - SOL GROUP

Environmental Management System Steering Com-
mittee (CGSQ) made up of the Executive Directors, General
Managers and Central Directors.

The Central Quality, Safety and Environmental Regula-
tory Affairs Management (DIQS) instead deals with the
operational aspect of the management systems, reporting
annually to the CGSQ.

The DIQS presents the progress of the projects and activities
to the Executive Directors and Central Directors on a quar-
terly basis.

Policies are documents at the foundation of the Manage-
ment system and are signed by the Chairman and General
Managers of the Group. These set out the principles underly-
ing the work of the Group's companies and define the objec-
tives that Management intends to pursue in the various are-
as. The SOL Group has recently introduced a new corporate
governance tool, Directives. These documents are issued at
corporate level and are obligatorily received by all the Group
companies.

THE REGULATORY AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT

Oxygen, medicinal air and nitrous oxide, Donopa (a mixture
of oxygen and nitrous oxide) and Neophyr (whose active sub-
stance is nitrogen monoxide) are the main drugs that the
Group distributes in the healthcare sector in hospitals and,
with regard to oxygen, in patients’ homes. Also in the health-
care sector, the Group produces and markets gas for medi-
cal devices, such as liquid nitrogen for cryopreservation and
cryotherapy and carbon dioxide for laparoscopy, and medi-
cal equipment and systems that are used in medicine for
diagnostic and therapeutic purposes (from oxygen distribu-
tion systems in hospitals to home mechanical fans).

Within the DIQS Department, the Regulatory and Pharma-
ceutical Affairs Department (DARF) serves to support, con-
trol and coordinate all SOL Group companies in the authori-
sation process for the production, distribution and marketing
of gases for medicinal use and medical devices.

Drugs and medical devices are subject to strict controls and
the documentation necessary for the authorisation process
is increasingly complex. The pharmaceutical workshops
which produce the drugs must be authorised by the Drug
Agencies, bodies that verify that all phases of the produc-
tion process follow GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) at
national level. Compliance with these guidelines guarantees
the quality of medicinal products, which in turn is a funda-
mental prerequisite for the medicinal product to be defined
as safe and effective. The manufacturer of a medical device

must obtain the CE marking, which proves that its product com-
plies with the safety and health requirements laid down in the
legislation in force. CE markings (for Class 2 and 3 devices, which
are those prevalent in the Group) are issued by Notified Bodies,
facilities (laboratories or companies) authorised by the compe-
tent authorities of the European Union countries.

The DARF is also responsible for managing all post-marketing
activities. Once a medicinal product or medical device has been
placed on the market, the manufacturer must regularly monitor
any adverse effects or lack of efficacy of the products concerned
(pharmaco-vigilance for medicinal products and material-vigi-
lance for medical devices). The company procedures establish
that each Group company sends specific reports to DARF for the
collection of reports, for analyses and for the evaluation of any
notification to the competent authority.

 

MEDICAL GASES:

Marketing Authorisations in
23 European countries;

56 production workshops in 14 countries

 

MEDICAL DEVICES:

DM gases produced in
16 units and distributed in 15 countries.

5 Group companies are manufacturers
(i.e. holders of CE markings) for medical gas
distribution plants or equipment.

RESPONSIBLE CARE

SOL Spa has subscribed to Responsible Care in Italy since
1995, the voluntary program of the world’s chemical industry,
supported in Italy by Federchimica, in which it plays an active
part with its own representative on the Managing Committee.

On 7 January 2015, SOL also adhered to the “Responsible
Care Global Charter”, committing itself to promoting the
principles and contents of the initiative in all countries where
the Group is present.

On 23 April 2015 the subsidiary Flosit also subscribed to the
program, promoted in Morocco by the “Fédération de la
Chimie et de la Parachimie”.

The implementation of the “Responsible Care” Program at SOL
Spa is checked every two years by a certification body.
