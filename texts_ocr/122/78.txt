It should be noted that with regard to emissions, the reporting
standard used (GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016)
provides for two different approaches to calculating indirect

emissions: "Location-based" and “Market-based”.

The “Location-based” approach (shown in the “GRI Content Index”
table) provides for the use of average emission factors related to the
specific national energy mix of electricity production. The “Market-

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

based" approach (reported in the chapter “The environment”)
provides for the use of emission factors defined on a contractual basis
with the electricity supplier. In the absence of specific contractual
agreements between the Organisation and the electricity supplier
(e.g. purchase of Guarantees of Origin), the emission factor related
to the national “residual mix" was used for the “Market-based”
approach, where available.

SOURCES OF EMISSION FACTORS USED

 

Direct emissions

Direct emissions from product deliveries

Indirect emissions according to the market-based method (European Union

countries)

Indirect emissions according to the market-based method (Bosnia-

Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Morocco)

Indirect emissions according to the location-based method
