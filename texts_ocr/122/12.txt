SUSTAINABILITY REPORT - SOL GROUP

 

MISSION AND
VALUES

The SOL Group seeks to provide its customers with inno-
vative and technologically advanced solutions at all
times and to offer patients the best possible home care
services, contributing to improving the quality of life on
the planet.

The values in which the SOL Group believes and from which
it takes daily inspiration are:

Ethical behaviour: in interpersonal relations, towards em-
ployees, customers, suppliers and all stakeholders.

Safety: we consider the workplace safety of all employees
and collaborators, as well as the safety of the products and
services we provide to our customers and patients, as a top
priority.

Customer satisfaction: we are committed to providing our
customers with innovative and technologically advanced
solutions at all times and to improving the quality of life of
our patients, guaranteeing them the best treatment and
the finest home care.

Balanced development: we strive to create balanced eco-
nomic growth and constant development over the long
term, employing resources efficiently and orienting them
constantly towards change.

Environmental protection: we seek to safeguard the envi-
ronment by optimising processes, and therefore using en-
ergy resources in the best possible way, and by developing
technologies and services that help our customers improve
their environmental efficiency.

Development of human resources: we believe that at-
tracting and retaining new talents and, in a broader sense,
training and developing the capacities of individuals are
fundamental tools for the success of the SOL Group.

The SOL Group adopted its own Code of Ethics in 2006,
which is a tool for the implementation of good behavioural
practices, a landmark and a guide for those working at SOL

and those interested in pursuing its mission. It expresses
the commitments and responsibilities that all SOL employ-
ees assume in conducting any business activity. Particular
attention is devoted to the protection of occupational

health and safety, the prevention and fight against cor-
ruption, as well as the protection of the environment and
respect for human rights.

The Code was reviewed in 2017 with the aim of further
highlighting the principles and conduct that must charac-
terise relationships with all stakeholders. A clear and simple
style was adopted to make sure that the contents are im-
mediately comprehensible.
