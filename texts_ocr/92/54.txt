SR 2017

METHODOLOGICAL NOTE

The present document constitutes the first Neodecortech Sus-
tainability Report. The Group is composed of the following com-
panies: Neodecortech S.p.A., Cartiere di Guarcino S.p.A. {in the
document, also referred to as “CDG”) and BEG S.r.l. {in the docu-
ment, also referred to as “BEG"), together “the Group” or “Neode-
cortech”.

Although it represents the first Report for the Group as a whole,
this Sustainability Report is in continuity with the Reports drafted
in 2015 and 2016 by the holding company Neodecortech S.p.A.. This
Report edition has been drafted according to GRI Standards guide-
lines - option “Core”- with the aim to gradually align the Group
Sustainability Reporting to the international best practices.

This reporting model has allowed to perform an accurate as-
sessment of chosen topics through the materiality analysis as well
as to start a related debate with different stakeholders groups.

The result is a complete description not only of Neodecortech
environmental, social and economic impacts, but also of its Group
identity, activities, governance and organization. Document struc-
ture, divided into three parts, reflects the main reporting areas:

1. Neodecortech: identity and economic performance
2. Environment (environmental impacts)
3. Stakeholders (social impact)

As already mentioned, the Reporting framework of data, related

to the calendar year 2017, considers all three Companies in the

Group. The Group goal is to give continuity to its Sustainability Re-
port publication over time on an annual basis. Whenever possible,
quantitative data are reported in comparison to the two previous
years, so that to highlight gradual developments.

In order to provide an accurate representation of Group perfor-
mance, quantitative indicators, directly extrapolated from Group
data or official sources, have been included. Estimates have been
used only marginally and have always been pointed out.

The Report is based on GRI Standards guidelines. To properly
define document contents, the Group has decided to include its
stakeholders, their point of view and licit expectations, identifying
its spokesmen as detailed in the related paragraph. The results
have been integrated in materiality analysis that has allowed to
identify the issues to be presented in the Report.

According to the adopted standards and in order to guarantee the
Report quality, the Report has been drafted with the aim to present
accurate, detailed, clear and comprehensible information, so that to
make all stakeholders able to evaluate Group performances. More-
over, the Report aim to represent all environmental, social and eco-
nomic performances (both positive and negative ones) ina balanced
fashion and in line with Neodecortech transparency policy, so that
stakeholders are properly informed when forming their opinion on
the Group. For further information, clarifications or suggestions:
