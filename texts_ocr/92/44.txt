Training and update
Training activities have a positive impact on human, professional,
technical and function-task growth of the single employee. These are
relevant not only to fulfill law and contract obligations, but also as an
integral part of Company routine activities for its employees. In Neo-
decortech, training activities are performed with a strategic and com-
pliance purpose for employees’ constant growth and improvement.

Training activities can be divided into 2 macro areas:

1. Prevention and safety: goals are established by regulations as
well as according to Neodecortech characteristics and entities.

2. Technical and professional training and refresher courses for
single employee and/or groups: goals are set by the Company accord-
ing to different training projects, with customized paths based on em-
ployee’s profile and task. They can vary in duration, complexity, etc.

By their nature, all training activities are aimed to achieve the con-
solidation and implementation of professional knowledge to improve
company performances. Companies make available their resources
to start collaborations or external consultancies, purchase/rent nec-
essary equipment, involve internal functions for teaching activities.

In 2017, Group Companies provided 4.613 training hours.

Neodecortech believes that a constant and high-quality training
is essential, not only to guarantee occupational safety, but also to
allow the employees to develop transversal capabilities and update
their professional competencies. Constant improvement cannot
and should not be just a mere declaration without follow-ups, but
a working style expressed through a strong professional ethic over
the time and with full collaboration. Knowledge, know-how, aware-
ness, autonomy and task-related technical and professional capa-
bilities blend in a single great, stable and constant training project
without an expiration date because it is vital for the individual’s per-
sonal and professional life. Neodecortech considers training activ-
ities as an instrument to improve not only company performances,
but also the transversal capabilities - essential for a constant pro-
fessional growth - of each one.

Lastly, the Group provided 7 courses on the different certifications
adopted, which have involved 57 people for a total amount of 2.514
training hours.
