Paper

Neodecortech S.p.A. paper is the most important raw material:
since 2015, it has been the only type of support used in the print-
ing department and it still is in the impregnation department.
The paper used in the Company production processes must
have particular printing characteristics in order to reflect as
accurately as possible wood or stone designs as well as, at the
same time, being sufficiently porous to allow the impregna-
tion with different types of resins based on the final application
(laminated, veneered, etc.), that make it resistant to mechanic
and chemical solicitations. The optimization of these two main
qualities and the color and characteristics constancy are the
key factors that make the process more performant and define
the end product quality.

More than 70% of paper is purchased in Italy, at Cartiere di Guar-
cino, while the remaining part comes from European industries.
The total amount of paper waste is accurately separated from pos-

sible pollutants in order to be used in the paper mill without any
additional process. To achieve this result, it has been necessary to
work on multiple fronts: sensitizing the staff in charge of printing
processes, using 100% destructible adhesive tapes and introduc-
ing new technologies to reduce the number of dye tests, saving in
this way both time and paper.

In the last triennium, paper waste in impregnation department
has decreased by 25%, while in the printing department has slight-
ly increased (+9.6%), remaining in any case around 8%.

For what it concerns packaging materials, given the fact that Ne-
odecortech products are not directly intended for the end consum-
er, but for companies that work in the interior design sector, the
Companies use transport packages that as, therefore, the function
of protecting products during the distribution until the following
stage of manufacturing: pallets and other wood components, pol-
ythene, cartons and cardboards.
