2.6 Waste

The Group is aware of the impacts that a good waste management
has both internally - in terms of production processes efficiency - and
externally, in the form of carbon footprint. For this reason, this issue
is managed with great attention, monitoring production processes
waste and carefully evaluating and selecting waste transport and
disposal companies. As a proof of this commitment, Group compa-
nies Organizational Models establish multiple procedures that regu-
late the management of this issue (services suppliers’ classification,
waste classification and management, ADR waste transport, etc.].

In 2017, 52% of Group non-hazardous waste was recovered to be
reused in other production processes.

It is essential the adoption of an increasingly efficient waste and
scrap management generated during production processes, in order
to increase recovery activities or, when this is impossible, the recy-
cling. For further information, see Appendix 2.

Neodecortech S.p.A.
Has converted part of crude paper, once considered as waste, in raw
material for CDG, thanks to a wiser waste sorting.
In 2017, PVC scrap was no longer disposed, but sent to specialized
companies for its recycling.

Cartiere di Guarcino
Has promised to reach the total recovery of organic and inorganic
materials (the first one constituted by cellulose fibers, while the sec-
ond one by titanium dioxide and kaolin) through the reuse of produc-
tion waste and waste sludge.

BEG
Is striving for the adoption of strategies to increase filter and cata-
lytic materials life-cycle in smoke abatement systems as well as the
implementation of mechanic filter systems in order to improve the
quantity and quality of bioliquids into motor-generators and decrease
waste sludge volume.
