Cellulose

Cellulose is one of the main chemicals of fibers that constitutes
wood mass. It is a natural polymer composed by many glucose
units, which form thread-like molecule chains of variable length.
Cellulose extraction occurs mainly from two arboreal families,
from conifers and broad-leaved trees. From conifers, for instance
pines and spruces, it is produced a long fiber, also called softwood,
which fibers a dimension of 2,5 mm and lend mechanic resistance
to the end product and therefore to the paper sheet. From broad-
leaved trees, such as eucalypt and poplar, a short fiber is produced,
called hardwood, which fibers have a dimension of approximately
of 1 mm. The use of short fiber improves paper sheet formation,
printability and opacity.

Cellulose constitutes the 70% of pulp for paper fabrication.
From a sustainability perspective, CDG has always privileged, for
the production of its papers, the use of waste materials, in par-
ticular paper waste recovered from production waste (winders
waste, breaks during paper sheet realization and non-conforming
end products) and sub-product (first and second production waste
made of cellulose fiber). Moreover, 18/20% of cellulose that the

Company uses comes from the reuse and recycle of production
waste, in line with circular economy principles.

For what it concerns cellulose provenance, that of short fiber
mainly comes from South America (Brazil) and Iberian Peninsula,
while the long fiber one comes from South America (Chile) and
the rest of it from Scandinavian Peninsula. Cartiere di Guarcino
complies with a careful purchase policy, preferring raw materials
from certified chain of custody, in compliance with certifications
schemes recognized at international level. As a proof of this com-
mitment, during the last three years, non-certified cellulose pur-
chased has represented only 2% of the total volume and has been
used for secondary product of low added value.

Overall in the last triennium, the Company has registered a
5,33% decrease in the total volume of used cellulose given the
same production level. This decrease is partly due to an improved
efficiency in the production process - as plant performance has in-
creased from 94% to 97% - and partly to an increase of high-ashes
papers production, that involve a greater use of inorganic material,
such as kaolin and titanium dioxide.
