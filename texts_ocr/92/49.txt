3.4 Local community and territory

Neodecortech considers indispensable being open to the dialogue
and debate with local communities and territories where the Group
Companies are located. Over the years it has pursued the goal of be-
ing a reliable, proactive, collaborative, transparent entity. The fair
and regular management of all regulation aspects related to Group
activities, along with the guidelines implemented over the years, has
made it possible to establish a collaborative debate with Entities, In-
stitutions and local Authorities.

In 2017 too, the Group Companies was subjected to local author-
ities’ inspections (Comune di Filago, Provincia di Frosinone, Arpa
Lombardia, and Arpa Lazio) regarding the fulfillment of legal require-
ments. For what it concerns Neodecortech, the inspection regarded
the conclusion of the trial on the atmosphere emissions deriving from
the papers impregnation productive process. The inspections ended
positively, without any formal notice nor fine.

Training on territory
Besides the opportunities of debate due to compliance requirements,
Neodecortech firmly believes in the necessity of establishing a dia-
logue with local communities. According to this purpose, the Group
companies have been offering internships for over twenty years, both
for high-school and university students.

In 2017, the Group offered educational internships and projects for
30 students that will continue throughout 2018, in collaboration with
high-school institutes of the territories in which the Group companies
are located. In addition to investments for employees’ training and
refresher courses, Neodecortech believes in the strategic value of
dialogue and collaboration with territory excellences. From this per-

spective of mutual sharing and growth, the Company has started an
alternating school/work program aimed to train professionals with
specific skills, to be included in departments where the growth path
is more significant: productive department, internationalization and
commercial department, R&D department.
The Company chose the candidates among territory schools and in-
stitutes, with study programs the most pertinent to the insertion de-
partments, as well as specialization courses. Over a 10-weeks period
in Neodecortech, three candidates - selected for their skills, predis-
position and enthusiasm -flank with expert departmental tutors for
their training.

Given the positive results and feedbacks at the end of 2017, the al-
ternating school/work program will continue throughout 2018 too
with more projects and pilots in addition to those already in place.

Donations

Donations are one of the instruments the Companies can use to ac-
tively contribute to the local community life, sharing success and dif-
ficult times. The donations range depends on territory characteristics
and needs and can be purely of social or cultural nature. In the first
case, for example: disabled vehicle purchase for Comune di Madone
and a stair lift for local middle school in Filago, donation of defibrilla-
tors for Comune di Madone and Comune di Filago, a donation to Saint
Bartholomew church in Marne [Filago) for the missionary school in
Makeni (Sierra Leone]. In the second case: CDG donation to the Tour-
ism Development Consortium in Guarcino and Campocatino. Lastly,
donations can be of recreational nature, such as CDG donations to the
Guarcino Football Club.
