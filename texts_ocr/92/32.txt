to reuse that material constituted by cellulose fiber, titanium dioxide
and kaolin, partly in its production cycle and partly selling it to other
paper mills. Consequently, the consignment to disposal and/or re-
cycling plants of non-hazardous waste has considerably decreased
(-78% over the last three years).
