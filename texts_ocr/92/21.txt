In the current scenario, characterized by a marked global compe-
tition for the access to limited resources, Neodecortech aims to
modulate its activity according to circular economy principles, both
to put into practice a sustainable approach and to improve its pro-
ductivity and competitivity. At the exact opposite side of the linear
economic approach, by which raw material are extracted, end prod-
ucts fabricated, used and tossed at the end of their lives - with sub-
sequent impacts on the environment -, the Group commits to put
into practice sustainable procurement policies and to produce less
waste possible, seeking to reuse or recycle them when possible, too.

Raw materials sustainability
The fundamental raw material for the production chain to which the
Group companies belong is produced from different kind of trees,
coming from all over the world: birch, picea and Scots pine from
Estonia, Lithuania, Sweden and Finland; Monterey pine from Chile;

Eucalyptus from Brazil, Spain and Uruguay. With such a wide range
of raw materials provenance, it is essential to verify their character-
istics through reliable instruments at international level.

The Forest Stewardship Council and the Programme for the En-
dorsement of Forest Certification schemes are two of the most
internationally recognized certification systems for wood raw ma-
terials and their sustainability.

Therefore, through FSC and PEFC logos, the customer can rec-
ognize products made of raw materials from sustainably and cor-
rectly managed forests, where trees cutting does not jeopardize the
overall forest health nor has negative impacts on local indigenous
populations. Given legislative provisions, production characteristics
and the sector in which they work, Cartiere di Guarcino and Neode-
cortech S.p.A. have decided to adopt the FSC MIXED certification,
which ensures that the 70% of cellulose comes from certified for-
ests. CDG is also PEFC certified.
