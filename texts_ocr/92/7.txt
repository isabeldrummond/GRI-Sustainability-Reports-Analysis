printing department, digital printing department, Lab., EDP,
Sales and company Union representatives.

- Clients involved, approximately 95% of turnover, have an-
swered, beyond the periodic customer satisfaction survey, to
some questions regarding Company activities and its impacts.

The purpose of stakeholder engagement activities is to exam-
ine the importance of each topic for the above-mentioned stake-
holder categories. Received contributions have been analyzed
and have allowed not only the Materiality Matrix improvement
(see following paragraph], but first and foremost have helped
the Company to better understand the expectations and point of
views of two very important counterparty categories, as employ-
ees and clients are.
