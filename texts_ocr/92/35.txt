2.8 Biodiversity

Biodiversity express the number, variety and variability of living or-
ganisms (plants, animals and microorganisms] and how these change
from an environment to another over the time. One of the main causes
of animal and vegetal biodiversity loss is the destruction of natural
habitats, as it occurs because of practices among which deforestation
is one of the most relevant.

Neodecortech is aware of biodiversity issue importance and aims
to reduce, as much as possible, the impacts of its supply chain, which
has cellulose as a starting point. Following this commitment, the
Group has adopted FSC and PEFC certifications, which guarantee
cellulose and paper provenance from sustainably-managed forests.

Moreover, although the Group Companies are not located in pro-
tected or biodiversity-sensitive areas, all share the same goal of a
correct and balanced integration between production activities and
surrounding environment to avoid negative impacts on the territory
as well as its flora and fauna. This approach is based on the idea that
the compliance with regulations is a minimum requirement, a start-
ing point from which certifications acquisition, monitoring of environ-
mental impacts and definition of steady improvement goals constitute
an integrated strategy aimed to safeguard the territories in which the
companies have been operating for decades.
