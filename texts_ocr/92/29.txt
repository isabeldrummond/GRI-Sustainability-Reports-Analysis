2.5 Emissions

The increase in the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmos-
phere represents one of the main factors for rising temperatures
in our planet. Emissions issue is very important for Neodecortech
because it represents a critical issue in sustainability topic: finding
a fair balance between satisfying current needs without compro-
mising future generation opportunities. Therefore, the Group thinks
in a circular logic that aims to increase the efficiency and improve
production processes of its companies in order to reduce the costs
and the impacts on the environment. In fact, even though the three
companies perform production activities that generate greenhouse
gases emissions per produced unit, the negative impact in terms of
GHG emissions has decreased over the years mainly thanks to the
increasing use of renewable energy resources.

Emissions intensity is calculated with reference to Companies
Scope 1 emissions, in comparison with the volume of respective
productions (CDG and NDT end product kg and kwh of BEG pro-
duced energy]. For further details see Appendix 1.

BEG has a positive impact on Group emissions balance, as it is
fueled with renewable energy resources (previously vegetal oils,
then animal fat). Biomass-induced CO, emissions, in fact, can be
considered as “carbon neutral”, as they are due to the carbon com-
ing out in the atmosphere through biogenic activities within a com-
parable timeframe.

GOALS

BEG: DIFFUSE EMISSIONS REDUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE SELECTIVE CATALYTIC

REDUCTION SYSTEM PERFORMANCES

CDG: INDIRECT EMISSIONS CONTAINMENT THROUGH THE ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION
REDUCTION OF THE PLANT. IN PARTICULAR, THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF HEAT CONSUMP-
TION AND THE OPTIMIZATION OF COMBINED HEAT AND POWER ENERGY USAGE.

NDT: HEAT ABATEMENT SYSTEM AND IMPREGNATION LINES OPTIMIZATION AS WELL AS
REFINEMENT OF THE MONITORING SYSTEM, THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF MORE PRECISE

AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE KPI.
