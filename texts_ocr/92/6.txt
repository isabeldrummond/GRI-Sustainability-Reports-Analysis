#1 NEODECORTECH: THE ITALIAN SIDE OF DECOR

Compliance
Neodecortech believes that the compliance with current regulations
is acrucial aspect for Group policies.

Legality and honesty in business are considered essential ingredi-
ents to develop and maintain good relationships with its stakehold-
ers, based on mutual trust and respect. These relations contribute
in preserving and increasing the Company value over the time, as it
would be considered as a reliable and transparent partner.

The reputation that Neodecortech can be proud of, starting from

he territory in which the Group Companies are based, is the result of
a steady operative and managing honesty over the years.
Moreover, an increasing rigorous approach to compliance issues is
more and more a necessity in the international environment in which
he Group works, allowing a conscious management of the risks that
may arise: equipped with the adequate control system, Neodecortech
ensures the compliance with norms and regulations and decreases
he probability of future incidents that may compromise its future de-
velopment and reputation.

Antibribery

The adoption, by all the three Group Companies, of an Organiza-
ional, Management and Control Model pursuant to Legislative
Decree 231/2001 is a tangible proof of the Group will to set its Gov-
ernance according to the most advanced standards with regards to
he compliance field.

Beyond the scope of the Legislative Decree 231/2001, this kind
of Organizational Model enhance an increased awareness in the
workers about their actions consequences to prevent criminal of-
ences, also through a constant updating and implementation of
measures in place.

All Group Companies, through the adoption of their Organization-
al Models, have carried out an assessment of all activities regarding
bribery-related risks. No process has resulted as significantly brib-
ery-risk exposed. Nevertheless, regarding the bribery issue, in the

 

Group Companies Codes of Conduct it is specifically pointed out the
need that every activity in the name and on behalf of the Group must
be carried out responsibly, legitimately and consistently with Compa-
nies goals and regulations. Relations with Public Administration fall
solely within the remit of deputized functions, which are called upon
to observe the principles of independence, impartiality, transparency
and decency expressed in the Organizational Models.

In line with the above-mentioned principles, bribery, both active and
passive, is strictly prohibited in Companies Codes of Conduct, both to-
wards Public Administration representatives and private party. Last-
ly, in line with what the correct implementation of the Model pursuant
to Legislative Decree 231/2001 requires, all Group staff has attended
a specific training course, receiving the Model and the Code of Con-
duct, and therefore is properly informed about Company policies re-
lated to anti-bribery topics.

Claims against environmental
and local community-related issues

Over the reporting period, the Group has not received any remarks
about non-compliance with laws or regulations related to envi-
ronmental or local-community issues. Neodecortech aims to be
perceived by the local community as a source of resources and op-
portunities for the territory. In this spirit, the Company pays close
attention to claims, related to both environmental issues and im-
pacts on local community, and shapes its activities around decency
and transparency standards, consistently with its own policies.

With its strong commitment to a rigorous compliance, Neode-
cortech aims to formulate and realize “shared” goals with Bodies
and Institutions for a correct Governance related also to environ-
mental issues, safeguarding its own workers and the local commu-
nity in general. Results registered up until now have been generally
positive precisely because decisions are shared and defined con-
sensually with the external counterparties.
