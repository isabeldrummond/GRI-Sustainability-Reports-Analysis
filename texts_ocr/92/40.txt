Turnover
As far as turnover is concerned, the following chart shows that val- v TURNOVER
ues have almost been steady in the last three years, registering a
slight increase in 2017 (+3.6% in comparison to 2016). The greater
number of retirements in comparison to new hiring mirrors em-
ployees’ high average age, (Neodecortech’s in particular) that, in

LL
combination with the technological improvements in production 10 To 100

processes, leads to a natural and gradual contraction in the work- 4,900
force. See Appendix 4 for further details. 5 —!”2 4,700
