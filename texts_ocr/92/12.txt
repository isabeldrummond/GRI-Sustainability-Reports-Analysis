#1 NEODECORTECH: THE ITALIAN SIDE OF DECOR

Cartiere di Guarcino

Making Pulp
Decor paper components (cellulose, fillers, chemicals and recycled
waste] are mixed proportionately into the pulper, where the pulp,
composed of water at 93%, is shacked and smashed.

Refining
To ensure the cellulose three-dimensional development and branch-
ing, which will give to paper sheet the right resistance and porosity
characteristics, the pulp is subjected to a refining process through
appropriate beaters. |

Papermaking
The pulp is distributed evenly on a flat surface that tends to the fibers
and ensures an even profile of the sheet; than a drying cloth sepa-
rates the water from the pulp using some blades and vacuum applied
in just as many drying boxes. Lastly, it is required a more energetic
mechanic action, using presses, to make the paper achieve a dry level
at 45% average. )

Drying
The paper sheet, gradually heated, releases water in form of steam
until it reaches a dry level at 98%. The paper is then pumped into a
curing system in which the epichlorohydrin resin branches, giving to
the sheet the right resistance to humidity. Y

Calendering
The paper sheet is subjected to the calandering process where, af-
ter steam-humidification, it is pressed between two rullers (one hard
and the other soft) to reach the right smoothness level. This process
ends with paper tape coiling. Y

Bioenergia Guarcino
BEG is founded to satisfy CDG electricity and heating needs.

Three Wartsila 16V32 engines with a power output of 6,865 Mw/h
and 3,9 tons/h of steam each ensure electricity production, through
an alternator directly linked to the engine, while the steam production
is guaranteed by the heat recovery through water-tube boilers. The
system has been calibrated to achieve CDG total energy employment
while excess energy is channeled to national sites.

Engines are fed with bioliquids: since 2017, the Company has de-
cided to use rendered animal fat (RAF] made in Italy, choosing in this
way a low environmental-impact fuel and enhancing a short chain at
the same time.
