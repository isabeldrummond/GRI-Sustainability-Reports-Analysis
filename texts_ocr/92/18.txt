2.1 Mitigation of environmental impacts

Environmental issues are fundamental for the Group: The Code of
Conduct and the certifications adopted are proof of a significant and
constant commitment. Considering the productive process of the
companies that constitute Neodecortech, all their activities naturally
meet with environmental sustainability issues. Therefore, it is inev-
itable that Group guidelines and strategic choices result in related
actions in production processes, in business organization and man-
agement with short, medium and long-term projects and programs.
The main environmental aspects considered by the Group are the
consumption of resources such as raw materials, chemicals, water,
and electricity and other fuels (bioliquids, diesel and methane], emis-
sions and biodiversity.
