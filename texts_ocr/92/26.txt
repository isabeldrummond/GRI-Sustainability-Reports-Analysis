In Groups like Neodecortech, chemicals pervade all production pro-
cesses. The presence of this kind of raw materials must be consid-
ered in light of two points of view: a positive one, represented by the
innovation and improvements that these materials allow, as well as
a negative one, represented by the possible side effects (pollution,
waste and pollutants).

Therefore, a responsible management of this issue develops on two
levels, both internal and external to the Group. While this latter con-
sists in the constant monitoring of market innovations and supplier's
selection, on an internal level the Group commits to the periodic and
careful training and refresher courses of its staff about both occupa-
tional safety and technical topics as well as investments on plants,
machineries and tools apt to adequate Group activities to the most
advance innovations.

Neodecortech works in compliance with European regulations such
as CLP (Classification, Labelling and Packaging), CE n. 1272/2008,

and REACH, acronym for the European Regulation on Registration,
Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, entered into
force on 1st June 2007. The Group in constantly committed to moni-
toring possible impacts of these substances on workers and the en-
vironment and, consequently, of norms that regulates these issues,
guidelines issued by local and international Institutions, in addition
to the research of increasingly eco-friendly and less dangerous raw
materials. In line with this commitment, in 2017 Neodecortech S.p.A.
joined a workgroup - self-constituted among companies working in
this industry, trade associations e technicians - on topics related to
European and local regulations and law for dangerous raw materials
such as formaldehyde. Analyzing data related to this issue, as shown
in the below charts, for what it concerns Neodecortech S.p.A., con-
sumption trend variations in the last three years are due to the intro-
duction of new kinds of products, while Cartiere di Guarcino has kept
its consumptions almost stable.
