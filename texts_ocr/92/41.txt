courses: the knowledge and understanding of these issues are the
first and most effective form of prevention against occupational ac-
cidents. The increase in the female absenteeism rate in 2016-2017
in comparison to the previous period is due to two cases of extended
sick leave periods.Considering the whole Group, the number of oc-
cupational accidents increased in 2017, while their gravity decreased
(+25% days of absence in comparison to a 50% increase in the number
of accidents). Data confirm the importance of not lowering the level
of attention regarding occupational health and safety, particularly for
the most simple and routine operations.

In 2017, the Group companies provided 15 training courses on occu-
pational health and safety, for a total amount of 1.157 hours of training
and 289 people involved.
