#1 NEODECORTECH: THE ITALIAN SIDE OF DECOR

1.1 Identity

Neodecortech is a Group composed of three companies that share
the same vision and a clear business strategy: to provide the interior
design sector with high-standards products, enriched with the typical
Italian style.

The Group is leader in Italy in the production of decor papers for
laminates and flooring. Neodecortech activities concern the produc-
tion of complete and technologically advanced solutions for the re-
alization of interior design projects, covering all stages of the decor
papers production process: from the management of raw materials,
through surface coating and impregnation, to the end product and the
end-of-line logistics management.

Group origins date back to 1947, Confalonieri year of foundation
(Neodecortech brand name and holding company) in Filago (Bergamo).

duction of printing inks. In the ‘60s, it modified its business focusing it

implementing also activities like printing and impregnation.

Nowadays the Company owns 900 series of print cylinders: an as-
set in which know-how and innovation meet to best express con-
temporary trends. In a steady flow of visual and cultural influences,
Neodecortech can understand each component of a new style and
transform them in an exclusive interpretation, in a tangible proposal.

In 1990 CDG (Cartiere di Guarcino) was founded. The Company
produces decor papers for high and low-pressure lamination, with a
strong tendency to innovation and a marked attention to environment
safeguard. In 2010, through the new dedicated company BEG Srl and
in collaboration with a leader company in the energy sector, CDG re-
alized a combined power and heat plant, fueled by biomass and in line
with Kyoto Protocol for CO, emissions reduction.

In 2017 the total integration of the three Companies took place,
through the acquisition of BEG entire share capital by CDG and the
following transfer of the entire CDG share capital in Neodecortech
operated by Finanziaria Valentini S.p.A. On 26th September 2017
Neodecortech listed on AIM Italia Capitals Market.
