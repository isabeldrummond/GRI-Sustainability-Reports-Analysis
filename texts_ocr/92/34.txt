Water pollution

Water pollution - due to industrial discharges in rivers, lakes and
seas - is an extremely relevant issue also in light of environmental
aspects, as for example biodiversity and ecosystems preservation.

The proximity to superficial water areas (Dordo creek in Neode-
cortech S.p.A. case, Cosa river in CDG and BEG one) is in fact a key
aspect on which the Group pays close attention to avoid water pol-
lution episodes that can provoke environmental damages and risks
to people. With this purpose, the Group has implemented specific
increasingly advanced instruments over the years, such as waste
waters filtration systems, pools, detectors and alarms that allow

to avoid the potential pollution of water areas and aquifers. This
has been possible through the use of financial, technical and pro-
fessional resources as well as preventive scheduled maintenance,
technical inspection and control interventions, water discharges
analysis. Obviously, the Group Companies interventions regarding
this issue are in compliance with regulations and use the best avail-
able technologies.

Overall, the Group has implemented alternative clean technolo-
gies or the best available ones to reduce liquid effluents impact and
periodically verifies their efficiency.
