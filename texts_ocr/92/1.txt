#1 NEODECORTECH: THE ITALIAN SIDE OF DECOR

Over 2017, Confalonieri S.p.A., along with Cartiere di Guarcino and
BEG, decided to undertake the path to go public on AIM Italia (Alterna-
tive Capital Market], managed and regulated by Borsa Italiana S.p.A.

This path, successfully concluded on 26th September 2017, led
to important changes in the strategic management and modus op-
erandi of the three companies, beyond the business name change
from Confalonieri S.p.A. to Neodecortech S.p.A.

For Neodecortech S.p.A., 2017 was a challenging year, which led
to a consequent reorganization and redefinition of roles, functions
and responsibilities in all business areas.

The present Sustainability Report is the first one issued for the en-
tire Neodecortech and gives us the opportunity to fully express the
Group mission, focused on “the man, the environment, the quality of
life, products and services offered to our clients”. Our strategic vision
is based on these principles, which are fully explained through the
adoption of certifications and business policies aimed to pursue im-
portant and ambitious goals as well as the way Neodecortech S.p.A.,
along with Cartiere di Guarcino and BEG, relates to its stakeholders.
These relations have always been based on mutual trust and com-
mon compliance with laws and rules, ina spirit of transparency.

Future goals and investments focus on two strategic pillars: in-
novation through R&D activities of both new products and the im-
provement of current production processes; human capital, through
training and refresher courses as well as professional growth of our
staff.

These goals and investments are consistent with the strategic
evolution path that Neodecortech has realized over the past years
and that allows the Group to face the challenges of the market with
composure and determination.

Neodecortech achievement in listing on AIM Capitals Market is
just the first step in its growth path: from now on it will be even
more important and strategic to be able to quickly read, interpret
and manage the solicitations we will face and to which we must re-
spond with just as much rapidity, determination and courage.
