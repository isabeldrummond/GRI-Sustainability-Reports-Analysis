Neodecortech is aware that the selection of a supplier is a critical fac-
tor that significantly contributes to determine the productive process
or products quality. Therefore, the Group companies aim to estab-
lish with each supplier a relationship based on mutual collaboration,
sharing quantitative and qualitative goals to constantly improve prod-
ucts quality.

Overall, the Group supply chain involves 140 main suppliers, among
raw materials, auxiliary products and services. As it is a small and
highly-specialized sector, the number of raw materials suppliers the
Company relies on is limited. Moreover, given the specific nature of
the materials used during productive processes (resins, titanium di-
oxide], it is frequently necessary to look beyond national borders to
select the most suitable supplier. Nevertheless, whenever possible,
the Group companies turn to local suppliers, especially for mainte-
nance activities, for transportation and services of all kind offered in
the territory (for further details, see Appendix 5).

Company partners supply not only raw materials - cellulose and
paper, inks and varnishes - , fuels and chemicals, but also mainte-
nance services and waste transportation: all essential factors for
Neodecortech success. For this reason, the Group aims to involve its
suppliers in the implemented environmental and labor policies.

For Neodecortech, it is essential that every supplier complies with
law and regulations: it is the starting point and essential premise to
establish a profitable business relationship based on mutual trust. A
lacking or wrong compliance with regulation on occupational safety
and environmental issue can lead to risks for employees’ health and
safety as well as environmental accidents: in this perspective, suppli-
ers control and management become a fundamental aspect. Over the
years, Neodecortech has selected trustworthy, reliable and compli-
ant suppliers, which can provide high-level and excellent products,
with this approach.

The Group has asked to almost 30% of its suppliers a self-decla-
ration of compliance with occupational health and safety and envi-
ronmental regulations. Of these, almost 20% is UNI EN ISO 14001
certified.
