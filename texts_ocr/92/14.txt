Cartiere di Guarcino products

Print base papers

ting resins and then transformed in laminated or veneered panels.
On these panels marble and wood surfaces are reproduced. Thanks
to its characteristics, this kind of paper allows the best printability in
the rotogravure and digital system. Print base papers are smoothed
mechanically with calenders and their mechanic pressure, because
of heat and humidity. Decor side is called “dandy roll side” and it is
intended to be printed.

Unicolor papers
Slightly smoothed papers, characterized by a low porosity level
and a high degree of opacity, recognizable by the uniformity of their
colors. They are intended for impregnation, the color chosen during
the impregnation process as only decoration. Depending on the res-
ins used during the impregnation process, papers can have differ-
ent features. These papers too are later transformed in laminated
or veneered panels.
