2.4 Energy

For Neodecortech, energy is a fundamental topic: in the form of
methane, steam or electricity, it is necessary in all production and
business management phases. Therefore, the intervention on Com-
pany energy efficiency has a relevant impact on both costs and the
overall Company carbon footprint. Given the high incidence of energy
costs on the paper production costs, as well as the direct and indirect
contribution of energy to the plant environmental performances, it is
important to manage in a systematic way all phases that contribute to
its own energy performances: energy management means constant
and structural attention to the energy use and costs with the purpose
of improving energy efficiency and reducing its costs. The introduc-
tion of an energy management system goes toward this direction:
both manufacturing industries that constitute the Group, Neode-
cortech and CDG, are certified in compliance with the international
regulation ISO 50001.

Energy intensity represents the relationship between energy total
consumption, measured in Mj, and the industrial production, meas-
ured in tons.

As shown in the above chart, for its nature CDG production is more
energy-consuming in comparison to Neodecortech S.p.A. one. Nev-
ertheless, in the last three years CDG energy intensity has slightly
decreased, while NDT has registered an increase in energy consump-
tion due to the introduction of new types of products.

This more energy-consuming characteristic that identifies CDG ac-
tivities in comparison to Neodecortech S.p.A. ones is confirmed also
through the observation of data regarding methane and electricity
consumption with reference to 2017, respectively 72% and 90% Group
total consumption.

Moreover, Group commitment to reduce its carbon footprint deriv-
ing from its energy consumption is developed also through the use of
privileged renewable energy resources that cover up to 92% of total
power energy consumption.
