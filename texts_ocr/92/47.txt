Consumer’s safety

Neodecortech pays particular attention to end-consumer’s safe-
ty, making sure that law requirements are correctly fulfilled and
remaining constantly updated regarding any new regulation. The
Companies decision to use increasingly safe and eco-friendly raw
materials demonstrates this approach and confirms the impor-
tance and the central position of this issue. Products labelling,
traceability and identification activities are part of Group routine
operational activities.

All Group companies take care of identifying possible dangers
related to the products, providing toxicological, environmental,
instructions information regarding products disposal and trans-
portation. The issue is relevant because products in and out trace-
ability enables monitoring and control systems activation.

Moreover, only through an efficient products labelling it is possible
to comply with FSC and PEFC certification (regarding cellulose and
paper raw materials sustainability) requirements on single lots
identification and raw materials origin traceability. Therefore, it is
possible to trace each unit in every moment and to link it to its ba-
sic paper, or even pulp, supplier. Neodecortech interest in ensur-
ing its products perfect traceability, both internally and externally,
has management purposes too: in case of a claim, it is essential
being able to identify each unit to trace back to the production lot
and analyze, through available data, causes and possible solu-
tions. During the reporting period no cases of non-compliance
with current regulation on labelling and consumers’ safety have
been registered.
