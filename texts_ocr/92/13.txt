#1 NEODECORTECH: THE ITALIAN SIDE OF DECOR

Neodecortech

Design and project of a décor
The process of creating a new decor can be triggered with a sample of
natural wood, stone or fabric, or from the idea for a purely geometric
fancy design. The Internal Laboratory begins the development of the
design, scanning the material to be reproduced and continues with
technical and creative interventions on computer. Color separation or
“variation " by color decomposition in the primary colors for each of
the engraving planes, each of which will correspond to a cylinder, is a
very important step because the accuracy with which it will be made
will affect the quality of the decor printing. |

Construction and photoengraving of the cylinders
The decorative design developed by the Internal Laboratory is deliv-
ered to the external laboratory for the photo-engraving phase of the
cylinders, the only one that takes place outside the Company. The cyl-
inders are then checked for verifying the proper engraving.

Rotogravure printing process
The cylinder surface is made up of numerous engravings of depth and
variable width that make up a design. These incisions receive the ink
in a differentiate quantity, then the cylinder surface is pressed against
the decorative paper on which the ink is transferred. Afterwards, the
paper passes through drying hoods up to four times until the final
design is realized. |)

Impregnation process

The impregnation process, which concerns only MEL and FINISH
products, consists in the treatment of special papers, plain colours
or woodgrains printed, with aqueous solutions containing melamine,
urea and acrylic resins. Each impregnation plant consists of an im-
pregnation station and a coating station, spaced by a drying tunnel
after each stage. After both passage steps in a number of ovens this
allows proper paper drying and, at the output of the plant, the paper
can be rolled on cardboard cores or cut in sheets.
