Specifically, sector-related sustainability aspects, relevant topics
to describe Group performance and environmental, social and eco-
nomic impacts: these are the topics analyzed also through the de-
bate with its own stakeholders (see previous paragraph], with the
purpose of expressing in a complete and transparent way respective
points of view and bring out the most relevant information contents.

The Materiality matrix is the result of this analysis and assess-
ment work: it depicts the importance level of each topic for Neode-
cortech (horizontal axis) and its stakeholders (vertical axis], giving
an overview of truly significant sustainability issues.

As stated above, the purpose of this analysis is also that of bet-
ter knowing its stakeholders expectations and interests to kick off
a path of Group performance improvement, starting from external
inputs that are then integrated in Neodecortech strategy and har-
monized with its principles.

Compared to the previous edition (Neodecortech S.p.A. Sustainability
Report 2016), the Matrix has been integrated and improved consider-
ing the different Report scope, to include CDG and BEG points of view
too. Therefore, these two companies have launched a first stage of
materiality analysis, through the involvement of Companies key of-
ficers, with the purpose of drawing an internal evaluation of the most
relevant topics for each Company and their respective stakeholders.
Asaresult, “Cellulose” topic has been added to the material aspects, as
a fundamental raw material for the industry in which the Group works.

Moreover, the materiality analysis has been integrated with new
evaluations expressed by stakeholders Neodecortech S.p.A. involved
during the assessment performed in 2017, measuring stakeholders’
evaluations according to the importance the Company attributed to
each counterparty group. Lastly, the three Companies evaluations
have been weighed according to each specific characteristic.
