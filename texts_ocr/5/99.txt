Risk management

IN Management Approach

Risk of failure to define/extend measures (e.g. We want to attract more women to technical professions. This is why
round tables, workshops) to involve we promote our company at the main local schools and universities,
stakeholders (e.g. educational institutions) in setting up meetings with professional women who already work in
raising public awareness about the issue of Alperia. Our communications department has also produced a video on
women in technical professions gender equality.

We want to be a family-friendly company for both men and women. For

Risk of work/life imbalance this reason, we promote reduced and flexible hours for our employees.
As a result of the measures we’ve adopted, we’ve been awarded the
Family and Work Audit certification from the Family Agency of the
Autonomous Province and Chamber of Commerce.

We are aware of how important it is for a modern, efficient and sustainable company to encourage the
employment of women. Currently, 23% of our people are women (+18% compared to 2018). During the year,
some important steps were taken in relation to closing the gender gap. For the first time, a woman was
appointed chairperson of the Management Board; we have achieved an equal gender balance in the same
body. However, we are convinced that more can be done. Although gender imbalance in a company like
Alperia is partly attributable to the particular sector in which we operate, with specific planning and measures,
there is still room for the percentage of women employed to be increased. Again this year, the Family Agency
of the Autonomous Province and Chamber of Commerce awarded us the Family Audit certification, which is a
testament to our efforts to harmonise the work/life balance of our staff. We are increasingly developing
conciliation and flexibility activities, including through the use of parent-support tools. From 2019 forward, for
example, parents receive a grant for children aged 3 to 10 to be used during school holidays. In addition, we
extended our contribution to nursery schools, including those in the municipal sector. By doing this, we
increased potential beneficiary numbers from 9 to 90 people. There are also measures for working hour
flexibility, including for part-time staff, and teleworking. Teleworking and remote working are two central
components of the digitalisation process, which is already underway.

In order to attract more women into the technical professions and increase the percentage of female managers,
Alperia also organised information days at province high schools and invited students to visit its plants, giving
them the opportunity to meet professionals already working for Alperia. University Career Days were also
organised in Trento, Innsbruck, Vienna and Graz. The communications team also produced a video on gender
equality. In 2020, a partnership will be signed with Valore D, an association of companies that promotes gender
balance and an inclusive culture within companies.
