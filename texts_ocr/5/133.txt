Mitigation/observations monitoring

 

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 1 — To help
create local value and select suppliers of raw
materials suitable for our business, we strategically
set ourselves the objective of making our

purchases as locally and sustainably as possible
from an ecological and social perspective. All of our
new suppliers are screened according to
environmental and social criteria. To achieve the
target objectives that we have set ourselves for the
selection of new suppliers on the basis of social
and environmental requirements, we have adopted
the BravoSolution system, assessing sustainability
criteria by goods category (high, medium, low
criticality).

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 2 - To avoid
the risk of a lack of transparency in the supplier
selection process, in particular in relation to
active/passive corruption issues, we are committed
to ensuring responsible supply chain management
by checking suppliers meet the requirements of
integrity, professionalism, technical standards and
good reputation. Furthermore, to avoid the risk of
non-ethical conduct on the part of suppliers,
employees, customers and other stakeholders, a
respect for human rights clause is included in the
group’s general terms and conditions for
contracting.

 

 

Asset integrity

Operational

RISK 1: OPERATIONAL - Risk
of failure to manage inspection
and maintenance activities for
dams and other hydraulic works
(e.g. pipelines, tunnels etc.) to
guarantee their structural
integrity and avoid potential
total or partial collapses, which
have the potential to impact on
the surrounding environment
and result in penalties from the
authorities.

RISK 2: OPERATIONAL - Risk
of damage to local communities
due to accidents at plants in
locations potentially sensitive to
natural disasters or terrorist
attacks.

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 1 — We want to
guarantee the maximum safety of our infrastructure,
dams and hydraulic works, to protect personnel, the
population and the surrounding area. For this
reason, we have introduced an accurate internal
control system, developed constant monitoring and
maintenance activities in compliance with legal
obligations and managed penstocks in compliance
with regulatory obligations. We also want to ensure
the resilience of our works and plants even in the
event of flooding. For this reason, we have
developed immediate action plans and signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Civil
Protection Agency of the Autonomous Province of
Bolzano for the management of emergencies
including flooding.

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 2 — We want to
ensure business continuity of all IT systems and
plants and minimise risks associated with sensitive
terrorism targets (e.g. cyber security and sensitive
locations). To this end, we have developed a
special business continuity and disaster recovery
plan.

Compliance

 

RISK 1: COMPLIANCE - Risk
of failure to achieve
adequate/maximum levels of
occupational health and safety
for employees and
collaborators (external
companies), in relation to
injuries, accidents and
occupational diseases with
potential non-compliance with
the legislation on the protection
of occupational health and
safety in workplaces

 

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 1 - We want to
ensure the highest level of safety in the workplace
for our employees and external staff (external
companies). For this reason, we are installing 30
semi-automatic defibrillators in our workplaces from
2020. We have numerous other tools including a
monthly HSE report on health and safety and
environment, online information tips on the issue of
safety, dedicated training for each group company,
partnership with the Civil Protection department and
ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 9001 and ISO 27001
certification, revised and renewed every year. We
have also introduced an accident, near miss and
environmental incident information collection and
reporting system. External companies are also
assessed on the basis of safety-related criteria.
