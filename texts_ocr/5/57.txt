Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

Each large dam with a reservoir of more than one million cubic metres of water and/or a barrier height of more
than 15 metres has a Civil Protection Document drawn up by the Autonomous Province of Bolzano and an
internal procedure for employee actions in the event of significant weather events. Supervisory staff at the dam
are qualified and authorised to carry out operations on the discharge units, even in the absence of telephone
communications. Alperia periodically trains the staff in charge of large-dam management; in the event of major
weather events, it ensures closer monitoring of the dams by specialist technical staff.

The first phase of flooding is not considered an emergency because the presence of dams can delay or reduce
the discharged flow rates compared to the incoming flow rates. Through this management, Alperia has the
opportunity to retain the volume of water that flows downstream during floods (lamination), reducing its
disruptive force. As a result, greater safety can be ensured for the population. In addition, any destructive effect
on the ecosystems immediately beneath can be contained.
