To further facilitate parenting, Alperia is also encouraging fathers to take advantage of parental leave to
improve the gender balance in the company. In 2019, 100% of women and 84% of men entitled to leave took
advantage of this measure. The average length of parental leave is around 9 months for women and around
2.5 weeks for men. After the parental leave concluded, 100% of men and 33% of women returned to work in
the company. Of the six who planned to return, two returned regularly while three took voluntary maternity
leave and one stopped working for Alperia.
