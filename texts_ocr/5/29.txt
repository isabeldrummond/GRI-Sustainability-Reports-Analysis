Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

Green Bond

In June 2016, Alperia SpA approved the establishment of a Euro Medium Term Note programme (EMTN
programme) up to a total amount of €600 million. In the period between June 2016 and October 2017, it issued
four tranches under the EMTN programme for a total nominal amount of €475 million, placed privately with
qualified Italian and foreign investors and listed on the regulated market of the Irish Stock Exchange. In October
2017, Alperia placed a Green Bond on the European market for a total amount of €100 million with a 10-year
maturity at a yield of 2,20% (the same as government bonds with the same maturity), destined exclusively for
a Norwegian institutional investor. This issue represents the fourth tranche of Alperia’s EMTN Programme and
the first in Italy in Norwegian currency, thus consolidating its presence as an issuer on the European capital
market. No new Green Bonds were issued in 2018. Alperia has used the proceeds of the Green Bond to:

1. Refinance debt used for the acquisition/creation of a portfolio of:

 

- hydroelectric plants in Northern Italy: 249 MW, generating about 0,9 TWh per year of energy. A similar
amount of energy generated from conventional sources would have resulted in 0,76 Mton of COz
pollution per year in the case of coal plants and in 0,33 Mton of COz pollution per year in the case of
natural-gas plants (combined cycle)

- photovoltaic systems in central Italy: 1 plant for 4,3 MW of installed power, generating about 4,4 GWh
per year of energy. A similar amount of energy generated from conventional sources would have
resulted in 3,74 Mton of COz pollution per year in the case of coal plants and in 1,62 Mton of CO2
pollution per year in the case of natural-gas plants (combined cycle)

- biomass power plant (wood chips) in Northern Italy: 1 plant of 9,5 MW of installed power, generating
about 20 GWh per year of energy. This plant has replaced a total system of equal power from domestic
heating boilers powered by heating oil. According to the declaration verified and accepted by EMAS
(Ecomanagement and Audit Scheme — the European Community Ecomanagement System and
Audit), this plant saved about 5,1 Kton per year of COz2 emissions in comparison with the previous
diesel-fuelled heating system

According to the report released by ISPRA (Istituto Superiore per la Ricerca Ambientale), the Italian institute
for environmental research, combustion of vegetable oil biomass is considered to have zero impact on COz
emissions; a similar amount of energy generated from conventional sources would have resulted in 0,22 Mton
of CQz pollution per year in the case of coal plants and in 0,1 Mton of COz pollution per year in the case of
natural-gas plants (combined cycle);

2. Refinance debt used to purchase a section of the electricity distribution grid from another network operator
served by the company in Northern Italy.

These investments have allowed the connection of 265 renewable energy production plants (hydroelectric,
photovoltaic, biomass) to the electricity grid, with a total capacity of 51 MW and an average annual production
of 91,5 GWh. As a result, there were 32.000 tonnes of COz2 saved from being released into the environment.

3. Finance the modernisation of hydroelectric power stations and the electricity distribution grid, and continuing
in 2019.

These investments made it possible to:
- achieve a significant reduction in grid losses by increasing the efficiency of the entire power
management system
- increase the technological level of the grid by introducing several devices for "smart" solutions aimed
at optimising power flows into the grid and minimising the need for further grid extensions
- increase the production of hydroelectric power by increasing the efficiency of the plant infrastructure

Alperia has commissioned DNV GL Business Assurance Italia S.r.l. to provide a Green Bond eligibility
assessment. The scope of the DNV GL opinion is limited to the Green Bond Principles 2017. In the course of
the assessment, DNV GL also took into account the requirements of Version 2.1 of the Climate Bond; however,
at the time of review, no Technical Criteria for Hydropower was available for Issuer use.
