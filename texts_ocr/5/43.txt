Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

Investments in the electricity grid

Alperia’s subsidiary Edyna manages a low, medium and high-voltage electricity grid. The grid covers 8.736
km with related plants and infrastructure. In order to ensure widespread and efficient coverage and reduce
power interruptions, investment is made every year to modernise and upgrade the networks. The main projects
in 2019 included:

- purchase of vegetable-oil transformers for secondary substations and low noise-impact transformers
for primary substations

- overhead line inspections and plant cutting where necessary (31 plant-cutting operations per 20,35
km and 55 line inspections)

- burying of cables or use of helicopter cables which, even if affected by an adverse weather event, do
not result in a power failure (in particular, 2 km of helicopter cables have been put in place)

- dismantling of the lines in Brunico and Sarentino, followed by those of Colma and Marlengo

- _ installation of three primary substations in 2019 and five new ones planned for 2020

- merger of the medium voltage grid from 16 kV to 20 kV, completed and already operational in Laives,
to be followed by Bolzano and Merano

- gradual transition of grid operation from isolated neutral to compensated neutral via a Petersen coil in
Cardano and the Resia station

- expansion of Petersen coils in Dobbiaco

- implementation of new automations on the network for better fault selectivity

Furthermore, the meters of over 200.000 customers will be replaced with new-generation Smart Meters in
2020. Meters will be replaced across Edyna’s entire distribution area, which includes 96 South Tyrolean
municipalities. Smart Meters will render the electricity grid even more intelligent and digital, with more efficient
energy distribution. The new meter is capable of detecting energy consumption in greater detail, allowing
customers to keep their energy use under control by viewing their home’s consumption curve, which is updated
every 15 minutes. This information will facilitate more rational energy use, opening the way for new technology
developments in energy savings and home automation. The first municipalities to have their meters replaced
will be Ora, Egna and Cardano. Edyna took on six new employees in 2019 to install Smart Meters, and foresees
a savings of more than €41 million.

Investments in district heating

In 2019, investment in the district heating sector, which has around 2.250 exchangers in South Tyrol, amounted
to over €13 million (91% more than in 2018):

- extension of the district heating network to Merano

- extension of the district heating network in Bolzano

- the extraordinary replacement of Merano’s gas turbine

- connection of a gasification plant in Merano, joining the network of energy from renewable sources

Construction of a biomass district heating plant in Merano also continues, involving an area of 13,000 square
metres. The project will be completed in 2020.

Investments in the hydroelectric sector

Hydropower is one of the major sources of renewable energy. It is ideal for electricity production, especially in
a region such as South Tyrol. Alperia invests in the upgrading and modernisation of existing plants to ensure
the safe and efficient management of this resource. In 2019, investment in the hydroelectric production sector
amounted to €30 million. The most significant projects include:

- development of dredging systems in Monguelfo and Vizze

- asset integrity activities with monitoring and installation of specific equipment to improve the safety of
hydraulic works (tunnels, penstocks etc.) in compliance with current legislation

- renovation of the Santa Valburga hydroelectric plant in Val d’Ultimo, with the replacement of the two
hydroelectric power production units (turbine and alternator) of the power plant’s electromechanical
equipment and the machine transformer
