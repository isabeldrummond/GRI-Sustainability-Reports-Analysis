Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

developing new products, services and business models to help our customers reduce their own
energy needs and improve their efficiency.

SDG 8 — Decent work and economic growth

Target 8.5: By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all
women and men, including young people and persons with disabilities; equal pay for work
of equal value — We have harmonised Alperia’s union agreements and HR policies to provide
uniform and fair framework conditions for all our employees.

Target 8.6: By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth that is neither employed
nor undergoing education or training — We want to support our employees in their
development. To achieve this, we have implemented internal training activities and developed
our Talent and Pillars of Alperia programmes. We're also developing policies aimed at attracting
and training new staff in order to support the generational shift.

Target 8.8: Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for
all workers: this includes all migrant workers, women in particular, and those in precarious
employment — We actively promote the health of our employees, guaranteeing the highest level
of work safety to protect our staff, the general population and the surrounding area. We have
adopted plant monitoring and maintenance measures, promoting wellness initiatives in all of our
workplaces. In addition, we scheduled the installation of 30 Red Cross and White Cross semi-
automatic defibrillators in 2019, which went operational in 2020 inside and outside of Alperia
workplaces and at some customer sites.

SDG 9 - Business, innovation and infrastructure

Target 9.1 and Target 9.4: Develop high-quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient
infrastructure, including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic
development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for
all // By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, with
increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally
sound technologies and industrial processes, with all countries taking action in
accordance with their respective capabilities — We want to ensure a safe and efficient energy
supply. To do this, we are developing increasingly modern distribution networks, maintaining and
making our plants more efficient and launching specific Smart City and eMobility plans;

Target 9.5: Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of
industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including, by 2030,
encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and
development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and
development spending — We want to actively contribute to the energy future and develop new
technology with innovative research projects. Our Innovation Board works to develop innovative
sustainability-oriented projects and we support innovation-related projects such as the Alperia
Startup Factory.

SDG 11 — Sustainable cities and communities:

Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per-capita environmental impact of cities by
focussing on air quality as well as municipal and other waste management — We invest in
research and innovation to encourage the development of greener, less energy-consuming,
traffic-free and smarter cities. Some examples of our work in this area include: investments in
green mobility, the Smart City project, which transforms cities into more sustainable and
integrated environments with advanced digital sensors, and the expansion of the district heating
network, which is understood to be the most ecological form of heating, to include Merano and
Bolzano.

SDG 12 — Sustainable consumption and production:

Target 12.6: Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to
adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting
cycle — We want to anchor ecological, social and economic sustainability to our governance and
management processes. We have set up a sustainability plan and implemented a new
sustainability policy; we have integrated at least one sustainability objective into the MBO scheme
for group executives; and from 2020, sustainability will take an even more central role in the new
business plan. Furthermore, we want to make our communications, both external and internal,
