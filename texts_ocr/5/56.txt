Risk management

itt Management Approach

Risk of failure to manage inspection and We want to guarantee the maximum safety of our infrastructure, dams and
maintenance activities for dams and hydraulic works in order to protect personnel, the population and the
other hydraulic works (e.g. pipelines, surrounding area. For this reason, we have introduced an accurate internal
tunnels etc.) to guarantee their structural control system, developed constant monitoring and maintenance activities in
integrity and avoid potential total or compliance with legal obligations and manage penstocks in compliance with
partial collapses, which have the regulatory obligations. We also want to ensure the resilience of our works
potential to impact on the surrounding and plants even in the event of flooding. For this reason, we have developed
environment and result in penalties from immediate action plans and signed a memorandum of understanding with
the authorities the Civil Protection Agency of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano for the
management of emergencies including flooding.

Risk of damage to local communities We want to ensure business continuity of all IT systems and plants and
due to accidents at plants in locations minimise risks associated with sensitive terrorism targets (e.g. cyber security
potentially sensitive to natural disasters and sensitive locations). To this end, we have developed a special Business
or terrorist attacks Continuity and Disaster Recovery plan.

Alperia operates 34 hydroelectric plants with large and small branches, 14 dams and 17 smaller sites, with
which it produces an average of around 4.000 Gwh of clean energy every year. Hydropower is one of the most
important renewable energy sources. It has no negative impact on the climate, is efficient and is particularly
suited to a mountainous region such as South Tyrol. Alperia is committed to ensuring its sustainable use and
minimising plant management risks. These are complex infrastructures, in potentially sensitive locations in
terms of accidents, natural disasters and terrorist attacks. A responsibility taken on by both individual business
units and the entire group. Planning monitoring and maintenance activities is essential to reducing faults and
ensuring increased system availability. This value was 86,43% in 2019 (87,67% in 2018) compared to a target
of 85,31%. The target for 2020 is 86,90%.

Vegetable oil

In the event of non-operation, Edyna plants could be at risk of environmental accidents. Edyna assesses this
risk and adopts possible corrective actions. An example of such an action is replacing mineral oil transformers
with vegetable oil transformers. This activity was developed in 2019 and is considered essential in reducing
environmental impact. Vegetable oil has a combustion point twice as high as mineral oil and therefore
significantly reduces fire risk compared to currently used mineral oils. In addition, vegetable oils are not
dangerous for human health and the environment; they are a renewable substance, can be reused and have
a high degree of biodegradability. The vegetable oil transformers used by Edyna are purchased in Italy and
must meet certain technical specifications. Priority is given to substituting transformers in protected areas such
as nature parks or areas crossed by rivers and/or streams within 15 metres.

Dam safety

More than 200 employees work in the hydroelectric power stations, overseeing the control and maintenance
of both the dam works and all the components of each hydroelectric plant. Dams are equipped with an
extensive monitoring system that detects the hydraulic and structural behaviour of the structures and the
reservoirs to ensure hydraulic safety. The main operating data is transmitted to the remote centre in Bolzano,
which monitors it in real time. The monitoring data as a whole are managed remotely by technicians from the
hydro-civil service of Bolzano. Twice a year, representatives of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport's
Technical Office for Dams visit the plant and carry out thorough inspections together with the responsible
engineer appointed by Alperia Greenpower or their designated representative. The Hydrology and Dams Office
of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano is responsible for checking smaller dams. Its officials, accompanied
by the appointed Alperia Greenpower technician, carry out annual or semi-annual inspections.
