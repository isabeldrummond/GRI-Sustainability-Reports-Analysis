renewable sources
and of the Smart City
project (ended in
2018)

* Implementation of
the
STORAGE4GRID
project (ends 2020),
for electric mobility,
and the FLEXIGRID
project (launched
2019), with the
objective of making
the electricity grid
safer, more reliable,
sustainable and
innovative. The latter
project involved a
test site in the
Sarntal Valley.

 

we intend to assess future
demand for domestic and
commercial/industrial use
of electric mobility, by
expanding storage
technology at the
distribution-network and
end-user level, through
development of a new
holistic methodology for
modelling, planning,
integration, management
and evaluation of
distributed energy storage
systems. There are
already two storage
systems installed in
Edynaâ€™s car park;

* Continuation of the
FLEXIGRID research
project, which will lead to
the development of future
secondary electrical
substations with the use of
new generation smart
meters.
