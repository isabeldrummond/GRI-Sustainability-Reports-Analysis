Corporate Governance {GRI 405-1, 102-16, 102-18}

In 2019, Alperia SpA and a large number of its subsidiaries or affiliates saw the members of their respective
management and/or control bodies reappointed on reaching the natural expiry of their mandate.

The parent company has adopted the two-tier system pursuant to Article 2409-octies of the Italian Civil Code,
which provides for a Management Board composed of six members and a Supervisory Board also composed
of six members, of whom three are appointed by the Autonomous Province of Bolzano and Selfin Srl and three
by the Municipalities of Bolzano and Merano.

Neither gender makes up less than one third of the membership of both bodies. Absolute gender equality was
achieved on the Management Board, with a membership of three women and three men. The body is chaired
by Flora Emma Kross, while the Deputy Chair is Renate K6nig. The other members of the Management Board,
who will remain in office for three years, are Helmuth Konrad Moroder, Daniela Vicidomini, General Manager
Johann Wohlfarter and Deputy General Manager Paolo Acuti. The Management Board has sole responsibility
for the administration and management of the company and therefore is responsible for the preparation and
implementation, once approved by the Supervisory Board, of the general strategic and programmatic policies
of the company and the group.

The Supervisory Board is made up of Mauro Marchi (Chairman), Wolfram Sparber (Deputy Chairman), Paula
Aspmair, Manfred Mayr, Maurizio Peluso and Luitgard Spdégler. Women make up 50% of the ten external
members on the company's two senior bodies. Meanwhile the Supervisory Board monitors compliance with
the law and the company's bylaws and the principles of sound administration. It also approves some operations
decided by the Management Board, which are considered strategic by the bylaws.

Operational control of the company rests with management, which is made up of General Manager Johann
Wohlfarter, Deputy General Manager Paolo Acuti and Corporate Strategy Director Paolo Vanoni. The General
Manager is the head of the management structure, guiding company business and overseeing all technical,
administrative and financial activities. Therefore, just like the Deputy General Manager, the holder of this
position has a dual role as a director and a member of the Management Board, contributing to Board’s
decision-making process. The Deputy General Manager, Paolo Acuti, has also been appointed as a member
of the Executive Committee and the Energy Management Board of Utilitalia, the Italian federation of energy,
water and environmental companies.

Alperia's governance structure is completed by the Internal Audit function, which carries out independent
and objective assurance. It evaluates the effectiveness of the internal control system and helps the
organisation pursue its goals by assessing whether the risk management and corporate governance processes
are adequate and function effectively. Internal Audit therefore assesses all corporate functions and
departments, systems, processes, directives, procedures and practices adopted by them, the parent company
and the companies belonging to the group.

Governance Tools {102-18}

Alperia has adopted various governance tools to ensure proper management of both internal and external
activities. Some of these tools comply with national legislation provisions and guarantee specific control of
activities; others, however, have been deliberately put in place by the group to strengthen the spirit of legality,
transparency and fairness.
