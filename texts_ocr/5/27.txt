Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

- Ageing workforce: Alperia and its Human Resources department are preparing for this issue through
an appropriate succession and talent-development plan.

- Development of electric mobility: Following the establishment of the new company Neogy Srl, with
Dolomiti Energia SpA, the objectives in this area will be revised and no longer managed through the
Alperia Sustainability Plan.

- Stakeholder engagement on sustainability issues: This is an area where Alperia is strengthening its
efforts.

Alperia has also set itself the objective of defining a system for reporting to top management in order to facilitate
the monitoring of corporate risks through the identification of specific indicators. This detailed analysis will also
be extended to other group companies to ensure sustainability is approached with an organic and integrated
vision. In 2018, structured analysis of HSE Health, Safety & Environment risks began for Alperia Greenpower
Srl, with particular reference to the Top ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) risks.

Finally, it should be noted that Alperia is part of the CSR Manager Network association ERM working group,
established to respond to the increasingly pressing need of companies to manage risks with an integrated
approach. For this reason, the ERM working group aims to: share sustainability experience and best practices,
define guidelines and risk-management methodologies related to ESG issues, and experiment with these
guidelines.
