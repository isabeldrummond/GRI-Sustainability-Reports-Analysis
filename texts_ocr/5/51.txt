Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

To limit inefficiencies, Edyna has:

- improved the quality of the distribution service and modernised the grid infrastructure
- started remote control on 92 secondary substations already in service and newly built
- continued with high- and medium-voltage connections, through the installation of three primary
substations
- merged the medium- and high-voltage grid in Laives
- continued to bury power lines, currently equal to 71% of the grid, reducing environmental impact and
improving the grid’s resilience. In detail, Edyna now has:
o Edyna low voltage: 5.169 km — of which 78 are underground
o dyna medium voltage: 3.315 km — of which 65 are underground
o  Edyna high voltage: 252 km — of which 8 are underground
