Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

were installed in the fields of 60 South Tyrolean fruit and vine growers, recording and monitoring irrigation
data. The system advises the farmer about soil-moisture levels and combines weather and current temperature
data. Modern data transmission technology makes it possible to give farmers the collected information directly,
online and in real-time. Alperia Smart Region, the Alperia business unit in charge of the project, has made its
know-how available to develop the technology that will allow farmers to manage the irrigation process without
waste. In the future, farmers will be able to retrieve sensor data on their mobile phones in real time, allowing
them to react promptly to water shortages. This will not only increase crop quality and ensure volumes, but will
also allow for an increasingly sustainable and natural agriculture industry.

Sybil

Alperia Bartucci has developed Sybil, an innovative system that regulates heat distribution by adjusting
generators and mixing valves, within the required comfort levels for the building. The technology works with
Artificial Intelligence algorithms and allows a lower average temperature to be maintained in boilers and
distribution circuits. The system produces intelligent alerts that correct non-optimum user behaviour and report
system malfunctions to the thermal power plant. All this generates savings of up to 30% on heating and
guarantees remote management of systems. The technology is unique (international patent pending) and
innovative in comparison to traditional control and monitoring systems.

Flexi-Grid

The electricity sector has seen a radical transformation in recent years: On one hand, there has been
exponential growth of non-programmable renewable source (NPRS) plants connected to the medium- and
low-voltage grid and, on the other, conventional plants capable of providing the necessary regulation services
to ensure safe system operation have been decommissioned. The Flexi-Grid project was launched to make
the electricity grid increasingly safe, reliable, sustainable and innovative. It involves 16 partners from five
European countries (Spain, France, Italy, Croatia and Greece) and will lead to the development of:

- future secondary electrical substations with the use of new generation smart meters

- protection systems that allow for and integrate a high penetration of renewable source produced
energy into the grid

- software modules that can identify anomalies or malfunctions along the network, first attempting
to resolve them automatically and then, if necessary, requesting the intervention of on-call staff
from the remote monitoring centre

In addition, a platform will be developed integrating hardware and software solutions to exploit data provided
by local energy resources and distributed with Flexi-Grid solutions, which will be interoperable with stakeholder
IT systems, increasing their potential to be replicated. This will allow the distribution operations along the DSO
(Distribution System Operator) electricity grid to be rendered more flexible, reliable and cost-efficient,
promoting market growth and development.

Edyna, as the main DSO of South Tyrol, participates in the project with the MV and LV grid at the Sarentino
primary substation. Here the medium-voltage and low-voltage grids are powered by a primary system. We
want to test the technical feasibility of modulating the production and loads connected to the medium-voltage
grid (to optimise grid power flows and reduce congestion) and use the available production for isolated
management of the electricity grid in emergency conditions. The project began on 30 October 2019 at the
CIRCE headquarters in Zaragoza, a research centre leading the consortium of partners; it will continue for 48
months.

Alperia Startup Factory

Alperia launched the Alperia Startup Factory, a competition for innovative ideas in the field of renewable energy
and the green economy. The project brings together start-ups, innovative SMEs, university researchers and
talented young people. The international call for innovative ideas covered five sectors: smart mobility, smart
home & building automation, public lighting, hydropower and call-centre optimisation. After a multi-stage
selection procedure, the candidates with the most interesting projects were invited to South Tyrol to participate
in a two-day workshop, the Innovation Camp. In a second phase, the finalists worked on creating prototypes
and carrying out market testing with a view to possible product marketing. The winning start-ups were
FieldBox.ai and Beedata, beating out 142 other candidates from across Europe. They then began a
collaboration with Alperia to implement the projects for customers and the company. FieldBox.ai, specialised
in artificial intelligence solutions for the industrial sector, put forward the Hydrobox project, a digital solution for
