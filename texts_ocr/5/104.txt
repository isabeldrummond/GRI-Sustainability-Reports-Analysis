Safe working

Each Alperia Group company has an HSE manager, who is also the Head of the Prevention and Protection
Service (RSPP). The RSPP is a role required by law, responsible for promoting all procedures to protect
workers and maintain a safe and healthy working environment. Alperia has always had a procedure for the
management of accidents and near-misses, which makes communication of these events systematic and
faster.

Alperia has implemented and certified an integrated Environmental Safety Quality management system,
compliant with the ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 standards which, as required by the
standards, are subject to annual review. Continuous improvement relates to both the management system
and its performance. The certification body (third party) carried out external audits of all the integrated
management systems in parallel with a complete internal audit cycle to assess general progress.

To raise worker awareness, a monthly report is published on quality, asset integrity, environment and health
and safety; any workplace accidents are discussed during periodic meetings. In addition, we scheduled the
installation of 30 Red Cross and White Cross defibrillators in 2019 (operational from 2020 forward) both inside
and outside of Alperia workplaces and at some customer sites. Emergency teams of workers will be adequately
trained in their use. There were also a number of other activities. In order to ensure all employees are aware
of the importance of occupational health and safety, Alperia provided 8.984 hours of training for the group
companies, in which a total of 707 employees took part.

Awareness-raising also takes place online and on the company intranet, with information tips accompanied by
the hashtag #weworksafely. This is also the title of a video made during the year on the issue of working safely.
Information about lessons learnt and periodic discussions about workplace accidents are also outlined. From
2019 forward, the HSE monthly report also includes a section called Zero Waste, aimed at further raising
awareness about environmental sustainability.

Alperia also continued activities under its agreement with the Civil Protection department for the management
of activities, facilitating communications related to critical infrastructures that could potentially cause serious
emergency situations. Health-surveillance management was also digitalised, using a dedicated IT system.

The Alperia Groupâ€™s workplace accidents remained almost unchanged compared to 2018, equal to 14 events
(13 in the preceding year). Absence days increased significantly, from 293 to 427. This increase was the result
of a very serious accident at Edyna, which forced employees to stay at home for several days. The Frequency
Index (Fl) subsequently went from 8,94 to 8,68 and the Severity Index (SI) from 0,20 to 0,26.
