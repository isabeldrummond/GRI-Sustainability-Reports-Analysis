Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

In August, Edyna faced a service interruption following a lightning strike that put two high-voltage lines to
Bolzano South out of service. This resulted in blackouts for the municipalities of Bolzano, Laives, Appiano,
Settequerce, Vilpiano, Terlano, Andriano, Nalles, Postal, Gargazzone, Lana, Tesimo, Prissiano, Renon, San
Genesio and Cornedo all’lsarco. By contacting the Terna Operations Centre, the national transmission grid
operator, Edyna restored supply to all the affected areas in four to six minutes.

For even more efficient management of future emergencies, Alperia signed a memorandum of understanding
with the Civil Protection Agency, to launch a stable and resilient communication system.

Snowfall in November

In November 2019, heavy snowfall hit South Tyrol and many people were affected by power outages. The
areas most affected were Val Pusteria, Val Badia, Val Gardena, Valle Isarco and Val d’Ega, where a state
of emergency was declared as a result of the high number of interrupted power lines. Overall, 57 medium-
voltage power lines suffered one or more failures. On 13 and 16 November, the peak was reached, with
25.000 users simultaneously disconnected. Edyna took action through its own staff, those from contracted
third-party companies and/or those brought in specifically to tackle the emergency, and with companies
from the neighbouring provinces. During the work, temporary generators (GE) were installed to restore
service as soon as possible. Indeed, most Edyna services were back to normal within 6 days.

Capacity market

Through the tender process managed by Terna, Alperia will make the generation capacity of some of its
hydroelectric power plants available to contribute to the stability of the national electricity system, in return
for an overall premium of €90,4 million. Alperia was awarded 557 MW for 2022 and 614 MW for 2023, and
46 MW for plants under complete refurbishment, the premium for which amounts to €51,7 million for 15
years. The goal of the capacity market is to lower the costs of the national electricity system, managing
peaks in energy demand and avoiding the risk of blackouts, even temporary ones. The Ministry for
Economic Development (MiSE) estimates that adoption of the capacity market will reduced market costs
for the Italian electricity system by around €3,35 billion. According to the MiSE, if the capacity market were
not adopted, it would neither be possible to guarantee the expected 2025 shutdown of the coal-fired

power plants still in operation nor to support further expected growth of renewables. With the same
systems, Alperia will continue to participate in the dispatching services market with additional
remuneration provided through the sale of energy. All this will allow Alperia to make a significant
contribution to safely managing the transition to a decarbonised energy system, in line with Pniec (the
National Energy and Climate Plan), with expected benefits for the Alperia Group in terms of lower volatility
of hydroelectric generation margins, which are exposed to weather and risks associated with market
pricing.

 

District heating: safe and sustainable heat

District heating is now the most environmentally friendly, safest and simplest way of providing buildings with
heat and hot water. It is a remote system that works by transporting heat generated by large cogeneration
plants through a network of pipelines to individual homes. It is considered particularly safe as it replaces the
many smaller gas and diesel fuelled boilers, which can be unstable and are, above all, unsustainable.

Through its subsidiary Alperia Ecoplus, Alperia operates five district heating plants in South Tyrol, located in
Bolzano, Merano (where the tender for the construction of a new biomass plant is in progress), Sesto, Chiusa
and Lazfons. The heat begins its journey at the production plant and is delivered directly to homes through an
underground network that is expanding every year, resulting in annual savings in CO2 emissions of several
thousand tonnes. To produce thermal energy, Alperia uses both biomass and natural gas. In addition, it utilises
residual heat from industrial processes as well as heat from Bolzano’s waste-to-energy plant, which recycles
municipal waste. For demand peaks or in the event of failure of the biomass boiler, district heating plants also
have gas or diesel boilers. Three plants are also equipped with co-generators (plants that produce electricity
and heat at the same time and therefore ensure extremely high energy-efficiency levels) that are fuelled by
natural gas.
