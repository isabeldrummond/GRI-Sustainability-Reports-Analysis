Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

Cyber Security

103-1 Explanation and definition

Management has identified the topic of IT security as relevant in the context of the materiality analysis. Alperia
contributes directly to collected data security management through its commercial activity in the markets. In
relation to data security and protection, the group has set up a specific unit that reports on activities and
measures. Information security protects Alperia’s know-how and the integrity of management systems,
safeguarding the general public’s peace of mind and ensuring the supply of electricity, gas and heat to the
community. The group defines the boundary of information security as the set of all the boundaries that derive
from the different areas involving IT and business. Specifically, these are the following boundaries and
operating environments: data centres, cloud computing, Wi-Fi, mobile and local networks, Internet of Things,
production plants, distribution plants, telecommunications, smart grids, transmission systems and fixed-line
and mobile devices. Specific limitations derive from the business organisational structure of the various BUs
and areas each with their own specific needs.

103-2 The management approach and its components

Management approaches include, among other things, certifications such as ISO 27001 and business
continuity plans (INS-212. 01 Business Continuity—Disaster Recovery IT), the plans for the prevention of
security threats (INS-105. 02 Information risk management, INS-220. 11 IT vulnerability management), etc.
The management approach aims to establish state-of-the-art data protection and security standards, and to
prevent negative impacts inside and outside the company as far as possible. Tools for this purpose include
ISO 27001 and the team capable of providing a professional response in the event of a cyber-attack (INS-
220.10 Incident Handling IT). Alperia has defined internal managers (e.g. Security Officer) who coordinate
security-related projects; the DPO (Data Protection Officer) oversees the implementation of the GDPR
(General Data Protection Regulation) and monitors compliance. The group also participates in national safety
conferences (e.g. CLUSIT) and promotes the training and continuous updating of its employees on the subject
of security and data protection.

103-3 Evaluation of the management approach

Evaluation of the management approach. Management systems are evaluated on a regular basis (from daily
to annually). For example, since 2015, the ISO 27000 certification has been assessed annually by an external
auditor. The effectiveness of management systems is also regularly reviewed and monitored on the basis of
set indicators and procedures. The necessary adjustments are constantly implemented throughout the year, if
and when required.

EMPLOYEES

Employee Development

103-1 Explanation and definition

This topic was identified as essential both in terms of impact and by stakeholders. With a staff of over 1.000
employees, the Alperia Group is one of South Tyrol’s largest employers, active in all areas of the energy sector,
from production and distribution to the sale of energy and innovative services. This activity has direct and
indirect impact both inside and outside the company.

103-2 The management approach and its components

The energy sector is constantly evolving, with increasing demands. Within this context, the specialisation and
qualification of employees is fundamental. To prevent any shortage of skilled labour resulting from the
numerous upcoming staff retirements, Alperia is intensifying partnerships with universities and secondary
schools. It also pursues the objective of ensuring regular training and further training of its staff. In order to
increase satisfaction and performance, reduce fluctuations and ensure high quality work, Alperia is committed
to supporting its employees in various ways. In addition to promoting health in the workplace, the company
offers measures to improve compatibility between work and family life, such as flexible working hours and
various models of part-time working. Responsibilities have been defined within the company. The family and
work audit was also maintained for 2019, with the aim of renewing it again in 2020.
