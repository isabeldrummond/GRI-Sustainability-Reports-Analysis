‘Alperia Bartucci was not included in 2018 data. Gruppo Green Power, Bluepower Connection Srl, Green Energy Group, and Unix Group Srl are not
included in 2019 data. The total number of 2019 Alperia Group employees (with the exception of Bartucci) — equal to 970 — cannot be compared to the
total number of employees indicated for 2018 — equal to 945 — net of employees leaving plus new hires in 2019, excluding Alperia Bartucci. The
appropriate 2018 figure in order to make this comparison is 961, not 945. This misalignment is due to a different scope of reporting for 2019 compared
to 2018 (entry of Alperia Sum and Alperia Trading) and a switch from the TPC to Zucchetti application (incorrect counting of terminated employees
