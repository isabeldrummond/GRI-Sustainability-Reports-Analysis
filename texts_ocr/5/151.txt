‘The main gases included are COz and SF6; emission factors used according to DEFRA (car fleet, biogenic emission) and ISPRA (gas, gasoline); data
consolidated according to financial control; data aggregated based on the GHG Protocol
Biogenic emissions out of wood-chip biomass are calculated with the IPPC Guidebook (2006); palm oil with DEFRA.

Data for 2018 restated due to an update in calculation method.

Location-based emission factor used for purchased electricity: TERNA (2017) based on the Italian energy mix; emission factor used for purchased
heat: EURAC. Market-based emissions have been calculated considering all renewable-certified electricity by an emission factor equal to 0. The
remaining, non-renewable certified electrical energy has instead been multiplied by the residual mix as per the European Residual Mix provided by AIB.

3Includes rental car fleet and well-to-tank associated emissions (emissions associated for the extraction, refining and transport pf raw fuel material

sources)

4Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions are included in the intensity ratios. Biogenic emissions are included in ratio.
