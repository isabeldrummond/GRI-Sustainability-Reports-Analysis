Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

CORPORATE STRATEGY

Alperia is already working on its 2020—2024 Strategic Plan, which will be presented in 2020. The document
will see sustainability become an increasingly central issue, with the integration of the UN SDG into the
planning for each business unit. This approach will make the group’s commitment to CSR increasingly strategic
and concrete. All investments, core and acceleration, will consequently be in line with the adopted business
strategy to further modernise plants, increase the sale of energy and green gas with a specific marketing
strategy and prioritise the development of innovation and energy-efficiency projects in the Smart Region.

In 2019, Alperia was involved in some significant corporate operations, namely: Dolomiti Energia Holding’s
entry into the share capital of Neogy (formerly Alperia Smart Mobility) — with a 50% share — to proceed with the
joint development of the electric mobility sector; the acquisition of 86,53% of the shares of Gruppo Green
Power SpA, a company based in Mirano (Venice) and active in providing services for the domestic energy-
efficiency sector; and the acquisition of 70% of the shares of SUM — Unindustria Multiutilities Services SpA,
operating in the market for electricity and gas sales to SMEs.

Materiality Analysis {GRI 102-46}

To improve sustainability performance within the company, Alperia has created a group-wide sustainability
reporting system. Through materiality analysis carried out in line with the Sustainability Reporting Standards
defined by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), we have defined the relevant issues where Alperia is
committed to developing concrete and coherent actions and initiatives. This materiality analysis ensures that
the topics and sustainability indicators essential for Alperia are identified, managed and reported. The process
to identify relevant topics was as follows:

- Preparation of a "long list" of relevant sustainability topics based on competitor analysis, relevant
megatrends, the media, stakeholders’ feedback and Alperia’s activities. Thirty topics were identified
in this analysis.

- Assessment of the potential impact of Alperia’s activities on the topics selected, during an internal
workshop with the departments and subsidiaries involved (ranked on a scale of 1 to 10, depending
on the extent of the impact). Twenty main topics resulted.

- Definition of priorities with stakeholders in relation to the 20 selected topic blocks, as part of an
anonymous online survey which 176 participants answered.

- Preparation of the materiality matrix through the selection and classification of topics based on
relevance. A topic is considered essential if: it is among the 10 main topics in the stakeholder survey
or among the top 10 significant impacts and/or scored more than 7 points in both the stakeholders
survey and impact assessment.

The 15 most relevant topics, classified in the materiality matrix by relevance, are: supply security; innovation,
research and development; employee development; customer satisfaction; occupational health and safety,
asset integrity; emissions; energy consumption; water; marketing and transparent communication; cyber
security; diversity and equal opportunity; sustainable energy products and services; supplier management;
economic development.
