Investments in the Smart Region {GRI 302.4, 203.1, 102.12}

Building a Smart Region means creating digital highways that allow people, things and means of transport to
communicate and interact. The goal is to apply maximum energy-efficiency principles so as not to waste our
renewable energy and to reduce COz emissions as much as possible. A Smart Region has an infrastructure
that promotes development of digital and connected communities; mobility is electric and consumption of
primary sources is reduced and efficient. The transformation of South Tyrol into a modern, sustainable and
innovative region is an ambitious programme to which Alperia is contributing with its investment programme.

According to the Strategic Plan, €88 million in investments are planned for the Smart Region. This will be self-
financed until 2021, with a further €18 million earmarked for other projects and digitalisation of assets and
processes. In 2019, Alperia Bartucci received €3,5 million (€2,1 million in 2018), Alperia Fiber received €4,3
million (€4,6 million in 2018) and Neogy €1,4 million.

The main 2019 activities included:

- energy efficiency consultancy for over 150 companies, including Pirelli factories worldwide

- creation and development of an artificial-intelligence system for building air conditioning (Sybil)

- development and launch of a new business model for building energy efficiency

- completion of the connection of 3.500 homes in the municipalities of Sesto, Chiusa and Tirolo to the
broadband network, bringing more than 500 service users online

- creation, development and launch of an loT (Internet of Things) network in South Tyrol

- launch of pilot project for prototype-connected sensors in the agricultural sector, in order to render
water consumption more efficient

- — launch of pilot project to create an Energy Community in collaboration with the Suedtiroler Bauernbund
Union of Direct Farmers and Growers

eMobility {GRI EU7}

Alperia Smart Mobility, the company responsible for developing electric mobility, saw Dolomiti Energia
Holding, energy provider of the Autonomous Province of Trento, enter into its share capital with a 50%
stake, leading to the establishment of the Neogy joint venture. For this reason, eMobility-related activities
are no longer consolidated. The aim of the merger is to encourage electric-mobility development by taking
advantage of the infrastructure already developed by Alperia and Dolomiti Energia. Through the merger of
the two existing networks, Neogy has more than 800 charging points and plans significant investment to
expand the charging station infrastructure to other areas of the country, with public charging stations and
dedicated charging points at commercial and accommodation facilities and a wide range of services.

All Neogy charging stations are powered by 100% renewable energy, produced in the hydroelectric power
plants belonging to Alperia and Dolomiti Energia groups. The infrastructure guarantees the widest
interoperability between different systems and circuits, as well as easy accessibility. All charging points
will be available both to customers who have a contract with the company or its other partners, and to
occasional customers. Similarly, Neogy customers will be able to charge their vehicles across Italy and
Europe by using other affiliated operators’ infrastructure. The estimated potential market, in a border area
such as Trentino-Alto Adige, is 400 thousand users, with 30% of monthly charging today already on a
roaming basis. To this end, an agreement has been finalised with Enel X, an Enel group company for the
development of electric mobility and digital services, and with the partners of the European roaming
platform Hubject, to allow Neogy customers to access over 70 thousand charging stations across Europe.
Neogy’s chargers will be reciprocally available to 300 e-mobility providers. Agreements have also been
