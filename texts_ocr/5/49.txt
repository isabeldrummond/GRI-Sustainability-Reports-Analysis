‘Net energy output includes energy produced in our consolidated plants (34 hydroelectric plants, 5 heating plants, 3 photovoltaic
parks, 7 photovoltaic plants, 1 biofuel plant) at 100%

? Includes thermal energy produced by biomass, gas, gasoline and energy acquired from waste plant. Heat acquired from waste plant
accounts for approximately 4 of produced thermal energy.

A secure distribution grid {GRI EU4; GRI EU28; GRI EU29}

Alperia manages a large part of the electricity grid in South Tyrol through its subsidiary Edyna and a 113 km
natural gas distribution network in four municipalities. Specifically:

- 8.736 km of electricity distribution lines, of which 71% is underground
- 181 additional km of underground lines

- 96 municipalities supplied out of a total of 116 municipalities in South Tyrol
- 2,6 TWh electricity distributed in South Tyrol

- 233.335 customers connected to Alperia’s electricity grid

- 5.169 km low-voltage lines (+1%)

- 3.315 km medium-voltage lines

- 252 km high-voltage lines

- 37 primary AT/MT substations

- 4,121 secondary MV/LV substations

- 46 MV switching substations

Edyna is replacing old meters with new generation Smart Meters, which are able to measure consumption in
greater detail and communicate with other devices. This represents a new frontier in Smart Home
development. The new meters will allow customers to keep their energy use under control by viewing their
