Smart Edyna

In 2018, Edyna launched the Smart Edyna project to create an intelligence base at the Edyna headquarters,
located at via Lungo Isarco 45/A in Bolzano. With the use of innovative technologies and through a single
dashboard, it will be possible to monitor different areas, such as:

- water reuse: Smart Water is a project dedicated to the collection of rainwater for irrigation,
measurement of water transit and detection of soil moisture, as well as intelligent irrigation based on
forecast and/or received weather data.

- parking management: Smart Vehicle is an intelligent parking system that identifies free spaces for
cars, bikes and motorbikes, counts vehicle numbers and has electric charging columns.

- lighting sensors: Smart Lighting is an LED lighting system activated by detection sensors when
pedestrians pass by

- access control: Smart Access is an automatic access recognition system.

Intelligent waste management is to be added to these already active four areas. The entire project, which

Edyna presented in the Long Research Night 2019, will end in 2020. Once the development phase is complete,
it will be offered to the market to encourage better energy resource management.
