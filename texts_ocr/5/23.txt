Alperia and the SDGs

On 25 September 2015, the United Nations approved the Global Agenda for Sustainable Development and its
17 goals, which are to be achieved by 2030. The European Union took part in the negotiation process that led
to the adoption of 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), launching a ten-year
strategic framework for growth and employment in 2010 (Europe 2020).

Aware of the essential role that energy can play in addressing these global challenges, Alperia is committed
to making its contribution to the implementation of some of the 17 SDGs. In particular, we are working on:

SDG 5 - Achieve gender equality:

Target 5.4: Recognise and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of
public services, infrastructure and social-protection policies, as well as the promotion of
shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate — We
want to be a family-friendly company for both men and women. For this reason, we promote reduced
and flexible hours for our employees. As a result of the measures we’ve adopted, we've been
awarded the Family and Work Audit certification from the Family Agency of the Autonomous
Province and Chamber of Commerce.

Target 5.5: Ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for
leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life — We are
working to attract more women into technical professions and to increase the percentage of female
managers. We have already made significant progress in this area: in 2019, the chairman of our
Management Board is a woman for the first time and the body itself is made up of 50% women. We
intend to further improve this trend in the future, and to reduce the gender pay gap.

SDG 6 - Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all

Target 6.5: By 2030, implement integrated water-resource management at all levels,
including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate — We are working on the
modernisation of our water infrastructure, in order to ensure that our systems are always reliable
and safe. With the development of innovative technology and new products, we are putting in place
specific initiatives such as the Smart Land Project designed to promote sustainable water resource
management. We also support responsible governance of water through our collaboration with
consortia and dedicated public bodies;

Target 6.6: By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains,
forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes — We want to minimise the impact of our
hydroelectric power plants on nature and the environment, actively protecting the biological diversity
of waterways. To achieve this, we operate in full compliance with legal provisions on Minimum Vital
Flow, building ladders for fish and implementing appropriate compensation measures. We have
committed ourselves to the renaturalisation and restoration of the landscape where there are
disused plants. We also supervise the reduction of contamination risk from recycled water and from
open cycle cooling.

SDG 7 - Affordable and clean energy

Target 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy
services — We want to ensure a safe and efficient energy supply, which is why we invest in the
development of sustainable energy solutions and in the modernisation of our plants and networks.
Target 7.2: By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global
energy mix — We produce 94% of our energy from net renewable sources. We intend to further
increase this through targeted investment, adopting new business models, monitoring and reporting
on the amount of energy produced, purchased and consumed by source. Full involvement of all
stakeholders and suppliers in the supply of clean energy is also important.

Target 7.3: By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency — Because
we want to make our energy consumption more efficient, we are using targeted initiatives to reduce
energy consumption in our buildings and plants. We are also developing new technology and
services that will further improve energy efficiency and reduce energy needs. Furthermore, we are
