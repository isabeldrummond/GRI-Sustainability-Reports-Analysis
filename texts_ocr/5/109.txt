Ensuring access for all to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy systems
— We invest in the development of sustainable energy solutions and in the modernisation of
our plants and networks. Through the development of innovative projects, we aim to primarily
generate our energy from renewable sources (we are already at 94% today). We involve our
suppliers to promote sustainable supply and we are developing new products, such as green
gas, as well as services and business lines to help our customers be more energy efficient.

Building a resilient infrastructure and promoting innovation and equitable, responsible
and sustainable industrialisation — We develop modern distribution networks, maintaining
and improve our systems. We also launched the Smart City and eMobility projects and provide
support to innovative research projects with our Innovation Board and dedicated initiatives such
as the Alperia Startup Factory. The many projects in this area include: the UVAMs we
developed in connecting the Bolzano district heating plant, LIFE4HeatRecovery for a new
generation of intelligent district heating and cooling networks where low-temperature waste
heat sources (10-40 °C) can be distributed to consumers and Flexi-Grid, a project that will lead
to the development of future secondary electrical substations with the use of new generation
smart meters.

Making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, durable and sustainable — We
have launched projects that will encourage the development of more energy-efficient and
sustainable cities. For example the Smart City project, the Smart Land project where we
installed intelligent moisture sensors in the fields of 60 South Tyrolean farmers to record and
monitor data to improve the irrigation process, investments in green mobility, the expansion
of the district heating network to Merano and Bolzano and the Regalgrid project for energy
communities and virtual aggregation units where consumers become prosumers, or "co-
producer consumers."

Ensuring sustainable patterns of production and consumption — Through targeted
marketing measures and information campaigns, we aim to raise our customers' awareness of
more sustainable consumption patterns and we strive to continuously develop our green
product and service portfolio through investing in research and development and promoting
innovation.

We want to contribute actively to South Tyrol's energy future and develop
new technology solutions with innovative research projects. We are
preparing innovation guidelines at the group level to support the activities
of the Innovation Board and are carrying out the projects selected in
2018. After the success of the previous year's event, we launched the
second Alperia Startup Factory.

To encourage the implementation of internal research and development activities, Alperia founded the
Innovation Board in 2018. This is a working group made up of employees from different business units and
services. The Innovation Board, created to promote a multidisciplinary approach to innovation, also continued
its activities in 2019. There were nine projects selected in 2018: two ended, two came to fruition (UVAM and
