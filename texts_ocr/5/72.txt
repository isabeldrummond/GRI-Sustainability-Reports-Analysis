Risk management

itt Management Approach

Risk of failing to optimise eco-sustainable We support the South Tyrol 2050 Climate Plan by reducing our
technology and define monitoring instruments greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, we have begun reporting
for greenhouse-gas emissions (e.g. activities related to environmental KPIs for the purposes of the
establishment of a group level report) Sustainability Report to monitor group emissions and carbon intensity.

Risk of non-compliance with mobility plans We want to reduce emissions related to mobility, making 50% of the fleet
developed for the company vehicle fleet in green in three years. We already have over 100 electric or hybrid
relation to reducing emissions vehicles.

Risk of non-compliance with activities to We want to minimise the pollution caused by our plants, which is why we
reduce pollution generated by the group's used part of the proceeds of the Green Bond to finance the modernisation
plants (e.g. air emissions, discharges into of the hydroelectric plants and the related distribution network.

water, waste, etc.)

The Alperia Group's activities generate emissions both directly and indirectly: the former being from production
and the latter through procurement of electricity from third parties. In particular:

- Scope 1: direct emissions of greenhouse gases produced by sources owned by the group (the COz
emissions generated by fuels burnt in energy production plants and those produced by the company
owned fleet/vehicles)

- Scope 2: COz emissions originating from the group's indirect consumption (emissions generated by
the purchase of electricity from third-party suppliers and consumed both in plants and in sites)

- Scope 3: emissions that, although connected to the core business and the business in general, are
not directly controlled by the group (the rental car fleet; emissions from the well to tank associated with
extraction; refining and transport of raw fuel sources such as palm oil and natural gas)

Alperia is committed to reducing its emissions to contribute to the South Tyrol 2050 Climate Plan. Currently,
European emissions amount to 9 tonnes of COz per capita annually; in South Tyrol, that amount is 5 tonnes.
We intend to further reduce that figure to 1,5 tonnes of COz per year, per capita, in accordance with the plan.
COz emissions, largely attributable to the energy sector, contribute significantly to the increase in the
greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. Alperia has therefore implemented regular monitoring of
greenhouse gases, and has set a group-level target for reducing emissions and identified possible corrective
actions. In 2019, we further improved the emissions monitoring system in order to provide a more structured
analysis, with a view towards digitalisation as well. Specifically, we estimated the generation of 127.749 t of
direct and indirect (market-based) COze, of which 13,08 are SOx and 46,58 NOx. Direct gross greenhouse
gas emissions (Scope 1, which also includes SF6) merit special attention: in 2019 they were 52.709 t COze,
while in the previous year they were 45.019 t COze, an increase of 17%. This is a physiological change, the
result of data-collection refinement which has led to a broader and more complete view of the situation. The
Edyna company SF6 values were included and the Alperia Green Power Marlengo plant was topped up, which
also increased the figures. The increase in emissions was also attributable to the higher use of diesel fuel
during the exceptional snowfall in the previous November.

NOx and SOx have adverse effects on climate, ecosystems, habitat, agriculture as well as human and animal
health; they lead to deterioration in air quality and acidification. These emissions come from combustion
processes, which relate to a small part of the Alperia business. A detailed analysis of the group's activities has
also shown that there are no activities that involve the emission of other climate-altering gases. Considering
the large proportion of renewable energy used by Alperia, the overall GHG Intensity is 0,03 tCO2e/Mwh. Even
if emissions in absolute terms have increased, the intensity has therefore remained unchanged compared to
2018 values (0,03 tCO2e/Mwh).

Finally, we connected our distribution company Edyna to district heating in 2019. It was the first company
within the group to be connected to this innovative and ecological form of heating.
