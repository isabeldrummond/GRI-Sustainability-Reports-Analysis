Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

to keep it up-to-date and reliable. In 2019 alone, we invested €104 million in this area. Even in times of
emergency, such as the extreme bouts of bad weather that hit South Tyrol last autumn, we were able to quickly
restore service, with no permanent damage to plants or injuries to our staff, who are highly trained and always
prepared to deal with this kind of situation.

During 2019, we also continued to extend the district heating network to Bolzano and Merano, and connected
our first subsidiary, Edyna, to district heating. With this system, we are investing in an ecological form of
heating, allowing us to further reduce fossil-fuel consumption and COz2 emissions. Just as important is the
commitment we made to energy efficiency and emissions reduction through Alperia Bartucci, including the
development of Sybil, an Al-based technology that creates alerts to correct non-optimum user behaviour and
reports system malfunctions, generating energy savings of up to 30%.

Water, a key asset

Water is our primary source of energy. It is clean, efficient and has no negative impact on the climate. It is of
particular importance in South Tyrol, a region which is naturally rich in water resources. Because we are aware
of its importance, we have developed a sustainable water-management system. In addition to holding
discussions with the provincial offices responsible for the protection of the aquatic environment and fish, and
carrying out regular river cleaning, we have signed an agreement with the Venosta Valley Reclamation
Consortium to guarantee the necessary water to protect orchards from night frosts during the spring flowering
period. A similar agreement has been made with the Piazzadella Consortium in Bolzano.

We have also launched the Smart Land project, together with the Laimburg Research Centre and the Fruit
and Vegetable Consultation Centre, with over 120 moisture sensors installed in the fields of 60 South Tyrolean
fruit and vine growers. These sensors are able to record and monitor data that can be useful for the irrigation
process, giving farmers real-time measurement information as well as avoiding waste and dispersion loss.

Finally, with Alperia Bartucci we have developed a project to optimise the Trento aqueduct water network
managed by the Novareti company. Alperia Bartucci has designed and implemented an advanced algorithm
based on predictive models that allows optimised water-pumping from wells to tanks and minimises network
pressure, ensuring more efficient management with lower loss and waste levels.

Research and development to create new sustainable business models

South Tyrol is on its way to becoming a smarter, greener province. Alperia intends to make an active
contribution to achieving that goal. Already to date, 94% of the energy we produce is from renewable
sources. To improve on this, we are developing new products such as green gas, as well as services and
business lines that help our customers be more energy efficient. In addition, we work with our suppliers to
promote sustainable procurement and collaborate with some of Italy's leading academic and technological
institutions by investing in research, development and innovation. Through our commitment to R&D, we are
working on projects to encourage the development of energy-efficient and more sustainable cities. The
Regalgrid project promotes the development of energy communities by changing consumers into
"prosumers" (co-producing consumers). Our Flexi-Grid project, meanwhile, will make the electricity grid more
and more safe, reliable, sustainable and innovative. Furthermore, between 2020 and 2024, Edyna, Alperia's
energy distribution company, will replace the meters of its more than 200,000 customers with new generation
Smart Meters, which will allow more efficient management of energy resources.

During 2019, we continued to carry out our Innovation Board projects, promoting a multidisciplinary approach
to innovation. Of the nine projects selected in 2018, two ended, two came to fruition (the Mixed Enabled Virtual
Units and ELISA chatbot) and five are still in progress. We also chose the winners of the Alperia Startup
Factory, our competition to promote innovation in the field of renewable energy and the green economy. Out
of 142 candidates from all over Europe, two came out on top: FieldBox.ai, with their digital solution to monitor
strain in penstocks, and Beedata, specialised in creating energy bills with additional information and
sophisticated data analysis. Given the success of the competition’s first year, we have already launched the
second edition, which has attracted applications from 230 teams based in 37 countries worldwide. We see this
as a sign that innovation in the energy field is truly a global mission.
