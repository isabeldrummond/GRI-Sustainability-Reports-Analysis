Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

LETTER TO THE STAKEHOLDERS (er! 102-14}

Dear Readers,

Three years have passed since Alperia started out on a formal sustainability journey. It is a concrete
commitment that has implications for our values and on a social, environmental and business level, as we
seek to generate long-term added value not only for our customers, but for the whole of the province where
we operate, South Tyrol.

As an energy service provider, we know how crucial our actions can be in contributing to the development of
amore sustainable and smarter province. A province where clean and accessible energy can be a widespread
and inclusive driver of well-being.

To achieve our goal, we must first have an in-depth understanding of today's risks and challenges and then
adopt the most suitable tools to face them. So, in 2019, in addition to measures to detect financial and plant
risks, Alperia developed a project to assess the group's non-financial risks, analysing the adequacy of our
planned monitoring. This allowed us to further refine our activities, specifically aligning them with the local and
global situation. The central challenges faced by all humanity include climate change, major natural disasters,
extreme weather events, but also the loss of biodiversity, environmental damage caused by humans and risks
associated with cyber security. We see these challenges as new opportunities for responsible development.
Through our work we want to contribute to the achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development
Goals. These are ambitious goals, to which we know we can make a real and positive contribution.

In an unprecedented historical moment, in which tens of thousands of companies and freelancers found
themselves confronted with no income from one week to the next, our company also had to face the difficulties
and insecurity related to COVID-19. The greatest attention was paid to safeguarding the health of employees.
The measures taken to support customers, our community and the region in which we operate will be detailed
in the Sustainability Report 2020 which will be published next year.

A sustainable vision

In 2019, we achieved 78% of the targets set out in the sustainability plan; in this, our third report, we would
like to illustrate to readers just how much progress has been made to structurally integrate sustainability into
our corporate strategy.

From the outset, we defined material topics in consultation with our stakeholders, giving us clear and
measurable objectives. This led us to establish the Steering Committee on Corporate Social Responsibility
and a CSR governance structure. In 2019, we also adopted a new sustainability policy and incorporated the
achievement of sustainability objectives into the assessment of our executives MBO scheme, in addition to
that of the company bonus scheme. But we have gone further still. Starting from the 2020-2024 Strategic Plan,
to be presented in 2020, sustainability will become increasingly central to the Alperia world, with UN SDG
indicators being integrated into each business unit's business plan.

With this as our driving vision, we have continued to increase investments in infrastructure, modernising it and
making it increasingly stable and efficient. We have continued to support the local economy; invested in
innovation, research and development; promoted transparent communication; and strengthened our trust-
based relationship with customers. In the next years, we will continue to strengthen the sale of sustainable
products and services (green gas and green energy), increasing their importance in our activities.

Commitment to the local economy

Supporting the economy of South Tyrol has always been one of our priorities, so much so that in 2019 we
created an added value locally of almost €235 million; we aim to reach €1.2 billion by 2021. We will achieve
this target through a range of actions, including tax payments, employee salaries and benefits, dividends to
shareholders, donations and sponsorship, as well as by purchasing products and services from local suppliers
whenever possible. In 2019, for example, 62% of our purchase orders went to suppliers based in South Tyrol.
And that's not all. Supporting our region means limiting the environmental impact of our activities as much as
possible (it's no coincidence that 71% of our power lines are underground) and working on our infrastructure
