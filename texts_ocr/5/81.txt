Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

- Information material: All the material Alperia uses for our communications to customers and internal
use is printed on 100% Forest Stewardship Council-certified paper; we offset the COz emissions.
Every year, we scrutinise our advertising materials to ensure we are making the most sustainable
choices. In 2019, we reduced printed brochure numbers from 35.000 to 17.250. In addition, during the
year, we also certified a new fully digital consulting system that further reduces paper use.

- Gadgets: The gadgets and small gifts that Alperia gives customers are in line with brand values. New
customers also receive a basket of sustainable local products, assembled in collaboration with Pur
Sidtirol.

- Paperless bills: All new contracts signed outside of South Tyrol include the adoption of paperless
bills, 100% COz neutral. Those who are already Alperia customers in South Tyrol have the option to
choose. Alperia is promoting the transition to paperless billing by offering tickets for events (e.g. tickets
for hockey games) to incentive the change. Currently, 27% of Alperia’s total customers receive
paperless bills, 3% more than the previous year (equal to 100.000 less DIN A4 pages printed a year.
This percentage includes energy and gas contracts on the open and protected market. Reseller
contracts, where Alperia does not manage billing are not considered).

- Monitoring complaints: Customer complaints are handled by Alperia Smart Services. In 2019, a
content-response procedure was defined for the first time, with Q&As available for more complex
questions. Domestic users were also given a monthly estimate, making use-management even more
transparent for customers. All packages, as presented on the website www.alperia.eu, were subjected
to independent verification and found to comply with the consumer code.

- Online Reviews: Alperia is the only utility company that allows Facebook reviews to be left freely and
openly. It is established as a Facebook partner and currently has a rating of 4 out of 5.

- Intranet: Alperia uses its. Intranet to communicate with its employees and strengthen corporate
cohesion.
