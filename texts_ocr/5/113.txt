Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

monitoring strain on penstocks. The automated surveillance system also has an important forecasting
capability. Beedata works in the data analytics sector of the energy market in Europe; its BeeTeam project
produces energy bills with additional information and sophisticated data analysis. Alperia Bartucci leads this
team. The project allowed for the production of customised reports for some industrial customers, with
suggestions for energy efficiency and changes in behaviour, sector benchmarking and initiatives to reduce
their carbon footprint.

Following the success of the first year, Alperia has launched the second Alperia Startup Factory, which will
end in May 2020 and will cover five themes: energy sharing, smart mobility, stakeholder and customer
engagement, district heating and intelligent & safe infrastructure. With 230 teams having applied for the
competition, there were 60% more than in the previous year (142 applications). Applications have come in
from 37 countries around the world, in Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Australia.

Open Innovation

Alperia collaborates with local and international partners from the scientific world and industry, including
research institutes, companies and start-ups. In 2019, it strengthened its collaboration with the Free University
of Bozen/Bolzano. One example is an event entitled â€œEnergy Day: Synergies between economic and technical
aspects," organised by Alperia and Edyna in collaboration with the university's Science and Technology
department. The event was held for students taking an econometrics course on their way to a degree in
economics and management, as well as those enrolled in the Hydropower Plants and Hydropower Systems
course in the Energy Engineering section of the M.S. programme. The aim of the event, attended by over 120
people, was to introduce students to real industry issues and highlight job prospects in the energy economy.

Collaborations also continued with Eurac Research Institute, IDM Sidtirol-Alto Adige and NOI Techpark, the
innovation campus in Bolzano. These collaborations are reinforced by a common predisposition to innovation
and multilingualism, an important driver for sharing ideas between the German and Italian world. South Tyrol
is privileged in being able to host experimental pilot projects, to test out and launch new technology solutions.

Smart Net

Edyna worked with 21 partners from nine European countries on Pilot A of the SmartNet research and
innovation project. The three-year project ended in June 2019, and focused on the crucial issue of how to
optimise grid storage of electricity produced from renewable sources. In Europe, production of electricity from
renewable sources is constantly increasing; likewise its use in electricity grids, mainly those of DSOs. This
involves major changes, not only for the European energy market, but also in the coordination between the
various operators of the electricity grids, especially in relation to medium- and high-voltage grids. The aim of
the SmartNet research project is to find and apply efficient tools and systems to improve coordination between
network operators, at both a national and European level. The exchange of information for network monitoring
and the development of ancillary services (voltage balancing, frequency adjustment and network congestion
management) is at the core of the project. The project is funded by the European Commission's Innovation
and Networking Agency (INEA) under the auspices of the Horizon 2020 research programme. Both industrial
and scientific partners participated in the project, and in addition to Edyna, the other parties involved include:
Terna (Italy's main national network operator), the Technical University of Denmark, Vodafone (Luxembourg),
Endesa (Spanish energy company), Sintef Energi As (Norwegian research facility) and Visa (Belgian research
institute). Ricerca sul Sistema Energetico, or RSE (managed by parent company GSE), coordinates the
SmartNet project. The new, varied equipment designed, built and installed as part of the trial under SmartNet's
Pilot A, with the related financial coverage, remains installed and working in the Valle Aurina production plants
that participated in the project. During autumn of 2020, a meeting is scheduled with technicians (plant
managers who collaborated in the project activities) in collaboration with the RSE coordinator, Gianluigi
Migliavacca, in order to illustrate the remarkable results achieved and the prospects for real-time data
exchange between generator, DSO and Terna.

Storage4Grid

The European Storage4Grid project looks at identifying a decision-making model to estimate the costs/benefits
of planned storage-system installations at private and public sites, where there is a simultaneous presence of
consumption, RES production (typically photovoltaic) and charging stations for electric vehicles. The
installation of storage equipment and a column for recharging electric car batteries in the Bolzano suburbs,
the Residential Site, was completed in a short period of time. During the autumn of 2019, storage equipment
was switched on that simultaneously feeds about a dozen charging columns for electric cars at the second
site, the Commercial-Industrial Site, at Edyna headquarters in via Lungo Isarco 45/A in Bolzano.
