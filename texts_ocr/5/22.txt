Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

neutrality by 2050. This is an ambitious mission to respond to a global challenge, to which we at Alperia also
want to contribute. We are highly aware of the coming risks, not only for the particular sector in which we
operate but also because water is our main resource: an asset increasingly influenced (and threatened) by the
current megatrends.

The world of IT also merits some attention. The 2020 Global Risks Report lists IT infrastructure failure as the
sixth most impacting risk for the years up to 2030. By 2025, approximately 75 billion devices will be connected
to each other and the internet, a market worth $11 trillion. The vulnerability of critical technology infrastructure
is a growing concern. For companies like ours, it is becoming an absolute priority. Attacks on the energy,
health and transportation sectors are becoming much more common and odious. The Internet of Things is
further amplifying the potential of cyberattacks. It is estimated that there are already over 21 billion loT devices
worldwide (which could double by 2025) and attacks have increased more than 300% in the first half of 2019.
In 2021, the cost of cybercrime damage could reach $6 trillion, an amount equivalent to the GDP of the world's
third largest economy. The challenge for both the public and private sectors is therefore to build modern
infrastructures and develop safe and reliable systems.

The energy challenge for South Tyrol

According to the Eurac Research Institute climate report, the average annual temperature in South Tyrol has
increased by 1,5°C since the 1960s. According to the worst-case scenario, summer months could see an
increase of a further 1,5°C by 2050. Such an increase would also have an impact on rainfall by 2100 and at
1.500 metres above sea level there could be 80-90% less snow than today, with even less water available in
the summer months. Meanwhile, extreme weather phenomena such as torrential rains will become
increasingly frequent.

Although in South Tyrol there are few industries using fossil fuels and the use of renewables is widespread,
we produce almost 5,3 tonnes of COz equivalent per year per capita. Transport alone is responsible for 44%
of total greenhouse gases, with higher figures than the national average. This is followed by the production of
thermal energy, with the heating of a pool of non-energy efficient buildings having an impact of 36%. The
agricultural sector ranks third, with our 18% of mainly methane and nitrous oxide emissions being higher than
the national average.

In 2011, the province adopted the South Tyrol 2050 Climate Plan, a strategic instrument providing a roadmap
to becoming an internationally recognised KlimaLand, with a sustainable approach to the energy issue. The
vision of South Tyrol's energy policy for 2050 includes:

- alimit on energy consumption per inhabitant (excluding grey energy)

- the reduction of COz emissions to less than 4t per year per capita by 2020 and to less than 1,5t per
year at the latest by 2050

-  anincrease in the percentage of energy needs met by renewable energy up to at least 75% by 2020,
and over 90% by 2050

South Tyrol has an advantage because of its autonomous status and the specificities of its economy, which
allow it to further consolidate its pioneering role in energy and climate policy. This is a commitment to which
we at Alperia actively contribute by focussing on sustainable water management, reducing emissions, plant
maintenance and developing innovations that contribute to the creation of the South Tyrol Green Region.

The South Tyrol 2050 Climate Plan®, which is joined by numerous other instruments such as CasaClima
certifications and the Green Mobility programme, will be updated in spring 2020 with measures that will:

- increase the energy efficiency of municipalities and production processes

- increase the use of wood products with long life cycles for energy and building renovations

- — limit greenhouse gas emissions from the production of equivalent materials from non-renewable raw
materials

- introduce integrated public transport climate protection measures

- further develop renewable energy (already today, 70% of energy needs in South Tyrol are met by
renewable energy production)

- increase connections to district heating
