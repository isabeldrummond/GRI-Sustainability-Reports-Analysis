TERRITORY
Security of Supply

103-1 Explanation and definition

This topic was identified as essential in the 2019 materiality analysis, both in terms of impact and stakeholders.
The direct impact on customers is the result of Alperia’s production and distribution of electricity. Alperia limits
itself to its core business, namely electricity production and distribution.

103-2 The management approach and its components

As the largest energy supplier in South Tyrol, Alperia aims to ensure a safe and efficient supply of electricity
from renewable sources. This is in keeping with the South Tyrol 2050 Climate Plan, which provides for the
promotion of renewable energy. In view of the growing demand for electricity in South Tyrol, it is essential to
supply and produce sufficient renewable energy now and in the future. The energy distribution system is
becoming increasingly complex and decentralised; it needs to respond more flexibly to energy production and
demand. Alperia must respond to this evolution, developing an efficient and intelligent network. The group
defines responsibilities internally. The remote monitoring centre in Bolzano is responsible for reporting any
malfunction or breakdown in the electricity supply service. The service, provided by bilingual operators, is
available 24/7, 365 days a year. Alperia budgets for investments to improve service quality and upgrade
network infrastructure to increase stability. They are reported annually in the sustainability report under
Investments.

103-3 Evaluation of the management approach

Management systems are regularly reviewed and monitored against set indicators; electricity distribution is
subject to the requirements of the national supervisory authority (ARERA). The systems are constantly
updated.

Supplier Management

103-1 Explanation and definition

This topic was identified as essential both in terms of impact and by stakeholders. As a complete supplier of
energy services, Alperia purchases its products, materials and raw materials from various Italian and foreign
suppliers. This leads to direct social and environmental impact throughout the supply chain.

103-2 The management approach and its components

In selecting suppliers and commercial partners, Alperia aims to ensure respect for environmental and safety
standards in the workplace. Alperia works with suppliers and commercial partners to make the supply chain
increasingly transparent and eco-sustainable by favouring local suppliers wherever possible. To this end,
Alperia selects suppliers based on specific sustainability criteria and standards, updating both the register of
suppliers and the vendor-rating system. In addition, all purchase contracts and the general terms and
conditions for contracting at a group level contain a binding human-rights clause. Responsibility for this topic
has been defined internally. The volume of purchases from local suppliers is regularly recorded and reported
annually in the sustainability reporting.

103-3 Evaluation of the management approach

The effectiveness of the management approach is regularly reviewed and monitored based on set indicators.
To ensure the quality of suppliers and to minimise the risk of loss and dependence, Alperia’s main suppliers
are evaluated according to a vendor rating system. The evaluation criteria are also integrated with sustainability
