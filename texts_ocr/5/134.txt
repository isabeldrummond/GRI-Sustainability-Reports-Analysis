Mitigation/observations monitoring

 

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 1 — We have
created individual career development plans for our
employees and organise specific internal training/e-
learning courses according to needs (e.g.
workplace safety, change management, cyber
security, etc.).

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 2 — We want to
ensure the presence of and compliance with group-
wide policies and procedures for the recruitment,
management and development of staff. To achieve
this, we apply the measures required by the Model
pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01 (segregation
of duties, powers of attorney and proxies,
traceability, objectives definition and selection,
performance measurement, etc.).

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 3 — We want to
ensure compliance with regulatory obligations
relating to staff training, updating training plans in
accordance with the quality system and monitoring
their actual performance in the area of compliance
(e.g. SSL, Legislative Decree 231/01).

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 4 - We want to
increase our employees' satisfaction. For this
reason, we carry out periodic surveys, including in
consultation with external bodies (e.g. Great Place
to Work® Institute Italia). The survey carried out in
2019 showed a 50% satisfaction rate and therefore
an increase of 9 points compared to the survey
carried out in 2016.

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 5 — We want to
create a stable and efficient company that has long-
term economic success and is capable of
consistently addressing the retirement plans of its
key staff. To do this we have taken the following
measures:

- we Carry out promotional activities at the main
schools and universities in the area to attract young
talent, in particular in the technical professions;

- we launched the Talent project which identifies
employees with growth potential among internal
staff;

- we continue to develop career development plans
for Pillar employees who want to get involved and
who have the skills Alperia needs.

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 6 —- We
establish relationships with employees and their
respective unions based on dialogue, limiting
conflict and generating development opportunities
in the mutual interest of all parties.

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 7 — We want to
establish a culture of transparent communication to
avoid potential inefficiencies in the management of
company activities. We do this with motivational
and team-building activities, for which we have
allocated a budget of €50/year per person, and with
training and career development activities.
