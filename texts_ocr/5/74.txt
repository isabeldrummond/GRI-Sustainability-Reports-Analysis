Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

Merano: the new Alperia headquarters focussed on emissions

A focus on sustainability principles is an integral part of the tender process for the construction of the new
Alperia headquarters in Merano. Alperia held a public international design competition, with the patronage of
Fondazione Inarcassa, the foundation of the National Engineers and Architects Fund. A temporary association
of companies won: Studio Cecchetto di Mestre for construction and design; engineering firm Von Pféstl &
Helfer Srl of Lana (BZ) for structural design; Steam Srl of Padua for systems design; Paolo Ceccon of Laura
Zampieri Architetti CZ for landscape design. The competition, in which more than 50 local, national and
international teams took part, focussed on building energy efficiency and aiming to acquire the highest levels
of existing energy and wellness certifications (LEED Platinum/Gold, CasaClima, WELL and CasaClima Work
and Life). The buildings will be designed with a focus on sustainability, home automation and smart living. The
spaces will be flexible and integrated into the existing and future urban context. The architecture will be inspired
by the landscape, incorporating essential elements such as water and nature, key elements in Alperia’s
corporate philosophy. The tender specified the construction of iconic buildings, recognisable and in some way
representing the essential elements, such as water and the roof garden. The goal is to build the first part of an
urban park that will redesign the surrounding area from a green perspective.

The project sees the Alperia and Edyna buildings separated but linked to each other via the underground
parking lot. Above this will be a large water pool mirroring the buildings which will appear to float. The Alperia
offices will be located in the centre, in a 22-metre high elliptical building that will be connected by means of a
walkway that will cross the water pool. The Edyna building will be much lower and partially underground, with
a pedestrian entrance from the park-road. It will have a roof garden for collective use, creating a green cover
with typical shrubs from the subalpine belt, such as juniper and mountain pine, alternating with a meadow and
rock garden.

Construction will begin in 2021 and the buildings are scheduled to be ready for 2023. The new headquarters
will host about 300 employees from various Alperia Group companies, as well as Edyna offices, technical
areas and warehouses. The approved budget for the entire project is around €25 million (excluding VAT).
During 2019, Alperia also awarded the project for the design of the new Alperia Greenpower headquarters in
via Claudia Augusta, Bolzano. Again here, there was an intense focus on the issue of energy efficiency and
well-being, with the aim of gaining certifications similar to those for the Merano office.

Noise pollution

Alperia is not only committed to reducing the COz emissions deriving from its activities, but also to limiting
environmental noise produced by its plants. To this end, a transformer was changed in Cardano in 2019,
replacing it with one with a lower noise impact. More information about these issues can be found in the Alperia
Greenpower and Alperia Vipower EMAS declarations, updated in 2019 and available on the
www.alperiagroup.eu website. The noise levels measured at district heating plants fall within the limits set by
current regulations.
