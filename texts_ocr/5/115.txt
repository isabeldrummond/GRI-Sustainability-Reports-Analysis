Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

Energy communities

The project dedicated to energy communities continued in 2019. Alperia signed a framework collaboration
agreement with Regalgrid Europe Srl, one of the digital energy sector leaders, back in 2018. The aim is to
develop a proprietary and patented digital platform and make it available to customers. The platform is capable
of offering advanced features allowing for the monitoring, optimisation and real-time management of self-
produced, accumulated and consumed energy. In the near future, increasing numbers of consumers will
become prosumers or co-producer consumers. The solution proposed by Regalgrid® allows the prosumer to
further evolve, by becoming part of a community of connected prosumers and optimising exchangeable energy
flows. This is useful to meet each of their needs and to reduce consumption costs, as well as those related to
investment in self-production and storage devices. It is a win-win mechanism: the user is more aware of his or
her needs, and the energy provider is more aware of its customer's needs. All this means personalised offers
can be made to customers, resulting in greater savings on bills and more transparency.

In 2019, the first devices supplied by Regalgrid were installed at the NOI Techpark in Bolzano. This made it
possible to launch the first virtual energy community in South Tyrol and one of the first in Italy. The SNOCU
(Smart NOde Control Unit) devices were connected to the existing photovoltaic system and specific users
inside the technology park, which were also equipped with storage systems and inverters supplied by Huawei
and SolarEdge. Additional internal users will be subsequently connected to the same community, together with
charging stations for electric vehicles. SNOCUs work by transmitting production, consumption and energy
storage data from the various connected prosumers to the cloud. A proprietary algorithm then defines the
different consumption profiles of each user, redistributing the energy intelligently and optimising flows within
the community. During the same year, another pilot project was launched in collaboration with Regalgrid.
Again, it was within the energy sector but this time more specifically aimed at the South Tyrolean farming
community. This second project involved 20 farms in South Tyrol. In seven, adequate inverters and storage
systems working with existing photovoltaic systems were installed in addition to SNOCUs, based on the
consumption needs of each user. The remaining 13 farms have only SNOCUs installed. By March 2020, all
installations will be complete, creating the Bauernbund Energy Community and virtually connecting the various
volunteers participating in the project. The detection and certification phase of the algorithm that governs the
operation of the SNOCUs will then begin. Eurac Research Institute has been given the task of ensuring the
effectiveness of the algorithm developed by Regalgrid for both projects, and will be required to give feedback
on the actual advantages in terms of economic savings and optimisation of flows in energy communities using
SNOCUs. The device, which is much more than a simple router, not only transmits data but allows inverters,
batteries and smart meters to communicate. It thus acts as a real actuator, capable of receiving orders from
the algorithm that governs the process, carrying out the switch-on and standby operations of the various
devices and therefore managing the energy flows of the energy community, transforming each system into an
active node in the community. The system offered by Alperia is unique because it provides for the existence
of a third-party network operator. Alperia itself will act as the managing body and deal with payments.

Alperia is in the final stage of defining its offers in the domestic field related to the supply and installation of
photovoltaic systems with accumulation. The company intends to also directly equip its customers with
SNOCU, making them energy community ready — that is, ready for access and active participation in the
energy community, so as to generate an economic advantage both for themselves and the energy provider.
The pilot phase of this project began in 2019. Ten users already equipped with a photovoltaic system had
adequate storage systems and related inverters installed to assess the results of at least one year's self-
production and actual self-consumption. This allows for the optimisation of future sector-specific offers in terms
of power size (photovoltaic systems) and energy (batteries) that can be installed, relative to the typical
consumption ranges of domestic users.
