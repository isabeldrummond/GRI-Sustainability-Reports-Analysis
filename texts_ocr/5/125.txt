Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

CUSTOMERS
Customer Satisfaction

103-1 Explanation and definition

This topic has been identified as essential, especially in terms of impact. Clearly, this is also very important for
stakeholders, but it is not among the top 10 key issues. Alperia’s direct impact derives from the sale of
electricity, gas and district heating. The impact concerns both the domestic customers of the protected and
free market and district heating customers, as well as business customers (small and medium) and large
customers.

103-2 The management approach and its components

Alperia pursues the goal of improving and expanding customer service and service quality, minimising
complaints. The complaint mechanism made available to customers is a freephone number answered by
bilingual local operators. Customers can also contact freephone operators by email. Complaint response times
are strictly regulated by the national regulator (ARERA), which obliges operators to comply with and, if
necessary, improve on these requirements. Responsibilities have been defined within the company. A
complaint control centre has been set up to ensure that complaints are dealt with promptly. A conciliation
service is also available.

103-3 Evaluation of the management approach

The national supervisory authority (ARERA) regularly reviews and monitors the achievement of the aims and
compliance with its requirements. In 2018, a customer survey was carried out which showed an 87%
satisfaction index. The survey is carried out every two years and will therefore be repeated in 2020.
Adjustments or improvements are also made during the year, whenever necessary.

Transparent Marketing and Communication

103-1 Explanation and definition
This topic was identified as essential in the materiality analysis both by stakeholders and in terms of impact.
The direct impact generated by Alperia’s energy sales is 323.772 customers served.

103-2 The management approach and its components

Alperia aims to perform responsible, authentic and adequate marketing. This implies a transparent and
understandable pricing structure and customer communication, the guarantee of adequate and fair offers and
transparent and verifiable sponsorship. Only projects that comply with the guidelines published online are
considered for sponsorship. In terms of customer communication, Alperia is committed to providing clear and
comprehensible information and energy bills. Any margin of manoeuvre is very limited due to the numerous
requirements imposed by the national authority for the sector (AEEGSI). For example, the information that
needs to be included in the electricity bill is prescribed in detail and leaves little room for creativity. Customer
service consultants receive complaints on the toll-free telephone number, by email or directly at customer
office counters. During 2019, estimates were also made available to customers to allow them to monitor their
energy consumption more clearly. Activities were also developed, respecting legal requirements, to encourage
customers to adopt paperless billing.

Responsibilities have been defined within the company. The budget for marketing and sponsoring activities is
defined annually.

103-3 Evaluation of the management approach
The evaluation is carried out regularly. Effectiveness is monitored several times a year on the basis of set
indicators and, where necessary, adjustments are made.
