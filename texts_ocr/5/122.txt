criteria. For each contract signed with a new supplier, Alperia can perform an audit and verify the supplier's
data by checking the information received; this happens partly through on-site inspections and interviews. In
2019, the BravoSolution tender-management system was implemented to make document management with
suppliers more efficient.

Economic Value

103-1 Explanation and definition

This topic has been identified as essential in terms of impact but, above all, by stakeholders. Alperia is one of
the largest companies in South Tyrol; all its shareholders are public institutions. The group’s economic growth
therefore has direct and indirect impact, both internally and externally.

103-2 The management approach and its components

Alperia aims to generate significant added value for the various stakeholder groups every year, in order to
boost local economic development (including dividends, salaries, taxes and environmental funds). In addition,
economic growth has indirect effects, such as investments in the development of infrastructure or the Smart
Region of South Tyrol, with which Alperia intends to create ecological added value for the province and to
make its own contribution to a smart and digital South Tyrol. Responsibilities are defined within the company.
The financial resources used are recorded annually in the context of sustainability reporting and reported
externally.

Omissions: complaint procedures.

103-3 Evaluation of the management approach
Effectiveness is assessed annually on the basis of previously defined indicators and, if necessary, adjusted.

Asset Integrity

103-1 Explanation and definition

This topic was identified as essential both in terms of impact and by stakeholders, in particular by coastal and
host municipalities, as well as stakeholders. For Alperia, the topic includes the use of security solutions and
plant security management to protect employees and residents. Business activity has direct and indirect impact
on the environment, the economy and society.

103-2 The management approach and its components

Alperia’s distribution infrastructure and power plants, reservoirs and dams are considered sensitive to
accidents, natural disasters or terrorist attacks. Alperia seeks to minimise the risks through investments in
safety and modernisation. Regular drills and comprehensive emergency plans are carried out to prepare for
emergencies. A serious accident would not only have an impact on the surrounding areas but would also have
a direct impact on the company itself. Responsibilities have been defined within each business unit.

103-3 Evaluation of the management approach
The evaluation is carried out regularly in the individual business units. Additional external inspections are also
carried out regularly, in accordance with legal requirements for plant safety

GREEN MISSION

Water

103-1 Explanation and definition
This topic was identified as essential by stakeholders and also in terms of impact. Alperia’s activities in the
field of hydroelectric production have direct impacts on water ecosystems.
