RISK 1: STRATEGIC — Risk of

inadequate measures/failure to
manage long-term climate
change with potential variable
demand of various stakeholders
determined by different weather
scenarios (e.g. expansion of the
heating network vs. global
warming)

RISK 2: OPERATIONAL - Risk
of potential malfunctions or
interruptions in the distribution
of energy, gas and district
heating due to: inadequate
activities to prevent damage
from adverse weather events,
inadequate inspections,
maintenance and planning of
new connections

RISK 3: OPERATIONAL - Risk
of potential malfunctions or
interruptions in the distribution
of electricity due to:
infrastructure inadequacy of the
electricity grid (e.g. availability,
reliability, efficiency);

inadequate level of automation
(e.g. fault and malfunction
detection); inadequate new
connection planning

RISK 4: OPERATIONAL - Risk
of inadequate connection
expansion measures in the
Bolzano district heating network
with potential impact on
customer satisfaction

RISK 5: FINANCIAL — Risk of
inadequate investment in
measures to improve plant
performance in terms of
availability, reliability and
efficiency

 

  

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 1 We're
diversifying our portfolio because we want to be
ready for climate change forecasts.

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 2 We've
created a portal for businesses where they can
register to view the status of underground line to
avoid the risk of potential malfunctions in electricity
distribution, with the aim of reducing both the
frequency and duration of power interruptions
themselves; we have taken out insurance policies
for adverse weather events risks.

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 3 We've
provided for the progressive burying of lines to
ensure greater stability of the distribution
infrastructure, improve service quality and
modernize the grid infrastructure, ensuring greater
stability.

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 4 We're
expanding the district heating network in both
Merano and Bolzano and have also connected our
first company to district heating: Edyna.

MITIGATION / CONTROL ACTION 5 We've
planned €400 million in investments into the core
business (Strategic Plan 2017-2021) over a period
of five years, in order to improve the availability,
reliability and efficiency of plants; we’re also
expanding the district heating network in Bolzano
and Merano.
