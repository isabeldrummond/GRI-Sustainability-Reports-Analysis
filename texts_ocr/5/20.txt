group), where it contributes to research in various areas such as energy efficiency in buildings and
smart buildings, industrial energy efficiency, energy sector innovation and water management.

-  Elettricita Futura: Italy’s main association of companies operating in the electricity sector, established
to form a basis for an efficient electricity market capable of responding to future challenges. Alperia is
a member, and its managing director Johann Wohlfarter has been part of the Strategic Committee
since 2019. The association is made up of 600 operators that have more than 75.000 MW of installed
conventional and renewable electrical power and about 1.150.000 km of lines.

- CSR Manager Network: This national association brings together professionals from a range of
organisations (companies, business foundations, professional companies, P.A., non-profit
organisations) who work in the management of socio-environmental and sustainability issues related
to corporate activities.

Human Rights

Respect for human rights is fundamental at Alperia. We adopt a system of values based on transparency and
respect for the dignity, equality and freedom of each individual. This is a commitment that we make both
internally and externally, including in the selection of suppliers, to the extent that purchase contracts and the
group's general terms and conditions for contracting include a binding clause of respect for human rights. In
line with the UN SDGs, we have identified the following human rights as pillars of the sustainability actions
described in this report, connecting them to the key themes of the 2017-2021 Sustainability Plan:

- Diversity and equal opportunity: Our employees are our most important asset. We want to create a
healthy, stimulating and family-friendly workplace for them. In 2019, we confirmed our Family Audit
certification from the Family Agency of the Autonomous Province and Chamber of Commerce. This
certificate demonstrates our efforts to improve the work-life balance of our staff. We are working to
attract more women into technical professions and to increase the percentage of female managers.
An area where we have already made significant progress in the governing bodies. In 2019, the
chairman of our Management Board was a woman and the body itself was made up of 50% women.
We intend to continue improving this trend in the future, with a focus on reducing the gender pay gap.

- Employee development: It is essential to support each of our employees on their path of professional
and personal growth. This is why we developed the Talent Programme, which highlights strengths and
suggests improvements for candidates. Its goal is to promote targeted personal development and
possible career advancement, offering specific training activities in relation to individual needs. In order
to encourage efficient and fair generational turnover, we are also working on a succession plan for the
replacement of key roles within the group over time. To guarantee the right to leisure and free time,
we support activities organised by the employees social club, CRAL, which has always been very
active. Every employee is guaranteed the right to privacy and social security; we also protect the
confidentiality of their data and information.

- Inclusive growth, safe and dignified work: We want to promote and guarantee the highest level of
occupational health and safety for our employees and external suppliers. We carry out monitoring and
maintenance activities of our offices and plants in compliance with regulations, encouraging the
research and development of innovative energy-efficiency solutions. In 2020, we scheduled
installation of 30 Red Cross and White Cross semi-automatic defibrillators, both inside and outside of
our workplaces. We actively promote initiatives to improve well-being, with targeted initiatives in the
Welfare Package, the introduction of water fountains in company workplaces and supplementary
health insurance. We have also continued to harmonise union agreements for all employees, in order
to establish uniform and fair framework conditions.

Risks and Opportunities {GRI 102-11, 102-15}

Climate change is one of the greatest environmental, social and economic threats to the modern world. Over
the past 150 years, the average global temperature has increased by nearly 0,8°C and by around 1°C in
Europe. Unless global action is taken to limit emissions, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) predicts that global temperatures will rise to between 1,8° and 4,0°C higher than pre-industrial times,
with an increase of between 6 and 9 metres in average sea levels, the loss of all coral reefs and the Amazon
rainforest, and large parts of the planet becoming uninhabitable?.
