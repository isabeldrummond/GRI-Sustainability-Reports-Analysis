resources. The water used in the energy-production process, after being taken from the intake structures, is
returned to the environment (river or lake) through a canal or tunnel. The quantities of water withdrawn and
turbinated are determined by concession decrees (administrative acts issued by the Province of Bolzano
regulating the use of water for hydroelectric plants), which also establish the quantities to be released into the
downstream sections (minimum vital outflows) in order to ensure the functioning of the aquatic ecosystem.

Sediment management
The management of sediment that accumulates upstream of hydroelectric plant intake works (river dams and

artificial basins) is of particular hydraulic and environmental importance. During flooding, and also in low water
periods, large waterways take in solid matter from various tributaries and transport it to the valley. Sediment
transport is a natural phenomenon, which is necessary for the river system itself, but also for lagoon systems
at the sea mouth and for the maintenance of coastal areas.

In South Tyrol some systems are managed by Alperia with barrier structures on the large watercourses of the
Adige, Isarco and Rienza valley floors.

There has been a discussion for the last twenty years on the issue of management of sediments that
accumulate upstream of intake works: fisheries managers would like this sediment not to be released
downstream due to the impact of these operations on fish fauna (requiring mechanical removal). The
authorities that oversee safety and hydraulic management consider the operations necessary to guarantee
the transport of sediment to the valley. The Concessionaire has the task of guaranteeing the hydraulic safety
of the intake works (effectiveness of the discharge components) and of maintaining the useful storage capacity
of reservoirs. In the last decade, Alperia presented management projects for reservoirs, which took into
account the various ecological, hydraulic and water-resource use needs including for other purposes (e.g.
irrigation). The individual management plans were drawn up in a climate of constructive dialogue with the
competent authorities, seeking sustainable solutions. The Concessionaire has made every effort to comply
with the requirements of these management plans.

For the artificial basins of Rio Pusteria and Fortezza, the management project foresees a release (draining)
during the low-water period, generally at three-year intervals; this involves the release of accumulated
sediment downstream. Studies carried out in the past— and also confirmed by the findings in 2019 — show that
these release operations cause a loss of the youngest fish (fish born in the release year); the adult population,
meanwhile, survives the prolonged periods of turbidity. The Concessionaire has tried to extend the time
between these releases to the extent possible, carrying them out in periods with high outflows; this guarantees
the highest dilution of sediment and good operational effectiveness. The release operation in the Rio Pusteria
basin carried out in summer 2019 received some negative press coverage. Alperia has launched a feasibility
study to implement alternative release methods.

Mitigation and offsetting measures
The operation of hydroelectric power stations in South Tyrol is accompanied by the adoption of environmental

measures. For the first time, and the only case in Italy, the granting of concessions for large hydroelectric
power plants in 2011 is linked to important environmental measures and the allocation of the necessary
financial resources. The adoption of environmental measures is also envisaged for the expired concessions
which are currently extended. Alperia has provided environmental funds annually for 16 large hydroelectric
plants: Santa Valburga-Pracomune, San Pancrazio, Lana, Sarentino, Cardano, Ponte Gardena, Bressanone,
Lappago, Molini di Tures, Lasa, Brunico, Glorenza-Castelbello, Tel, Marlengo, Vizze and Barbiano.

For the entire 30-year duration of the concession, Alperia will allocate approximately €400 million to
environmental projects, to benefit the coastal municipalities affected by the presence of the power stations. In
2019, Alperia made available €18,8 million to carry out these projects, of which €17 million was destined for
the Alperia GreenPower and Alperia VIPower plants. In so doing, it implements numerous environmental and
landscape conservation and improvement projects previously identified by the boards of the individual
hydroelectric plants. Environmental improvement measures are carried out by the coastal municipalities
themselves, by the Autonomous Province of Bolzano or by the concessionaire. A part of them deal with water
courses (morphological improvements, removal of obstacles to the migration of fish, renaturalisations,
measures promoting indigenous species of fish fauna, etc.). For some plants, the responsible province offices
and fishing associations provide for the breeding of fry every year, in accordance with the Concession
Regulations, in order to rebalance the distribution of fish species and to allow fishing. To encourage the
improvement of the life of fish species, artificial passages (fish ladders) to the intake structures are planned
for some plants. Currently there is no centralised complaint mechanism; complaints are handled locally at the
individual power plants. We have set a target to implement a centralised complaint mechanism by 2021.
