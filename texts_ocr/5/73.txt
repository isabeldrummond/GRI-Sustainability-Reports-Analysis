‘The main gases included are CO2 and SF6; emission factors used according to DEFRA (car fleet, biogenic emission) and ISPRA (gas, gasoline); data
consolidated according to financial control; data aggregated based on the GHG Protocol

Biogenic emission from wood-chip biomass are calculated using the IPPC Guidebook (2006); palm oil with DEFRA.

Data for 2018 restated due to an update in calculation method.

Location-based emission factor used for purchased electricity: TERNA (2017) based on the Italian energy mix; emission factor used for purchased
heat: EURAC. Market-based emissions have been calculated considering all renewable certified electricity an emission factor equal to 0. The remaining,
non-renewable certified electrical energy, has instead been multiplied by the residual mix as per the European Residual Mix provided by AIB.

sources)

Green mobility to reduce emissions

In 2019, Alperia developed a study on mobility to understand how best to promote green mobility to its
employees. A questionnaire distributed on the intranet was completed by 30% of the total Alperia population.
The analysis of the data collected revealed that: 50% of employees travel to work by car (40%) or motorbike
(10%); 40% by bike (32%) or on foot (8%); and 10% by bus (6%) or by train (4%). In addition, 71% responded
that they would consider using a bike if given one, or if a contribution towards buying one existed; 67% said
they would consider using public transport more; 26% would be willing to take part in carpooling. Numerous
suggestions came from employees completing the questionnaire, including: e-bike charging stations at offices;
kits/tools for minor maintenance and inflating tyres at offices; contributions to the purchase/rental of electric
bikes; contributions to public transport costs; car and/or bike sharing. Alperia had already started to add electric
and hybrid vehicles to the company car fleet in 2018. In December 2019 it reached the symbolic number of
100 electric vehicles, with which employees can travel creating zero emissions. Among these, 91 vehicles are
electric, 11 are hybrids and one is a hydrogen car. The target is to reach 120 electric/hybrid vehicles by the
end of 2020 and 170 by 2021, equivalent to 50% of Alperia’s potentially electric fleet. All these vehicles will be
charged with 100% renewable energy produced in the group’s hydroelectric plants. Given the numbers, it is
possible that the target set will be achieved even earlier than expected. This will mean a significant reduction
in the environmental impact of transport, both in terms of air quality and noise. And from 2020, new measures
of various kinds will be put in place to develop green mobility for home to work journeys. Finally, it should be
remembered that Alperia already provides traditional bicycles and e-bikes for service journeys.
