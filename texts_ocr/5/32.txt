Strategy and Action Areas

Employees, Green Mission, Community, Customers, Development and Innovation: these are the five action
areas upon which we are developing our sustainability programme. Our aim is to reduce energy consumption
and greenhouse gas emissions, develop the Smart Region of South Tyrol, increase customer and employee
satisfaction, increase the share of turnover from the sale of sustainable products and services and create an
added value of â‚¬1,2 billion for the whole province over a period of five years. It is a programme implemented
by Alperia through the reconciliation of economic objectives with ecological and social goals. Being sustainable
not only means looking after the province, but also thinking about the well-being and satisfaction of the people
who work with us, as well as promoting the development of an increasingly smart and green South Tyrolean
community. One of the ways this can be done is investing in research and development that will allow us to
develop cutting-edge energy models capable of reducing consumption, waste and emissions. To make our
efforts more concrete and coherent, the 2020-2024 Strategic Plan will be fully integrated with our sustainability
strategy. According to the results of the annual review, 78% of the operating objectives planned for 2019 were
achieved. The degree to which objectives are achieved affects company bonuses and, from this year forward,
our executive MBO scheme. In 2019, we achieved 25 of the 32 objectives we set for ourselves. The seven
that we did not achieve are:

- Reduce the duration of interruptions: In 2019, the duration of customer-supply interruptions recorded
was 28,07 minutes with a 3% increase in SAIDI (power outage duration per customer) compared to
2018.

- No accidents involving employees and those of external firms: In 2019 we had 14 accidents which
involved employees and two which involved external firms.

- 100% of significant tenders contain minimum sustainability requirements: In 2019, we reached 80%.

- Increase in the number of customers receiving e-bills to 90%: In 2019, we reached 27%.

- Organise regular feedback interviews with 100% of employees: In 2019, we reached 51%.

- Reduction in the rate of absence: In 2019, the rate of absence increased from 5,5% (2018) to 6,01%.

- Improvement of staff data quality: The development of an IT dashboard is still ongoing.
