Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

In the year 2019, there were 2,250 exchangers providing heat for thousands of South Tyrolean families. Work
to expand the network has continued, specifically:

- with an investment of €6,8 million, excavation work began in Bolzano to lay new pipes to connect
many more public and private buildings by the autumn of 2020. This further reduced fossil-fuel
consumption and CO2 emissions, as required by the Municipality of Bolzano's Climate Plan. Through
the use of this network and waste heat from the incinerator, around 14.800 tonnes of COz emissions
were saved in 2019. The expansion works began at the crossroads at via Genova and via Alessandria,
stretching along the bike path on the right bank of the Isarco to Druso Stadium, encompassing a part
of via Rovigo. The second lot covers viale Europa, via Sorrento, viale Druso, via Amalfi, via Roen, via
Gaismair and the remaining part of via Rovigo. For the Bolzano district heating service, Alperia mainly
uses the residual heat from the city's waste-to-energy plant. Inside Alperia Tower, a 40-metre high
heat-storage tank at the Bolzano South district heating plant, water warmed by the residual heat of the
waste-to-energy plant is stored and then fed into the district heating network when necessary. The two
expansion lots are a further step forward in Bolzano’s plan to expand its district heating network, as
envisaged in the Municipality of Bolzano’s Masterplan, COz Plan and Sustainable Energy Action Plan
(SEAP). Connecting the capital's hospital to the district heating network is strategically important,
powered by the heat from the waste-to-energy plant. This is considered an essential part of the district
heating expansion plan and the hospital complex will be the largest user of thermal energy, with a
supply of approximately 8,300 MWh of energy. The connection will make it possible to save more than
1,500 tonnes of COz emissions every year. It will also be possible to connect the Scuola Superiore di
Sanita Claudiana as well as the White Cross and Red Cross buildings to district heating, thereby
saving another 700 tonnes of CO2 every year. It should also be noted that a tax credit is offered to
anyone using district heating.

- In Merano and Lagundo, Alperia supplies 475 substations with district heating, providing green heat
to more than 5.600 families and approximately 520 additional company, school and office users. Here
too, expansion works began in 2019, on the stretch of network between via Cassa di Risparmio and
piazza della Rena. As part of this expansion work, the Kurhaus, the symbol of the city on the Passer
River, will also be connected to the district heating network and supplied with eco-friendly thermal
energy. Alperia is also building a new biomass district heating plant in Merano, in order to guarantee
an even more sustainable and reliable heat supply. Currently, the district heating system saves 8.000
tonnes of CO2 emissions every year, roughly equivalent to the COz absorption of a 5-square-kilometre
forest; this represents 1/5 of the Municipality of Merano’s surface area.

Heat created from waste. (1) Steam produced by combustion in the Bolzano waste-to-energy plant drives a
turbine (2) to produce electricity. The residual heat (3) is used by the Alperia district heating plant, meeting
citizens' needs. In addition to the heat from the waste-to-energy plant, Alperia has a heat storage tank (4) and
spare boilers and co-generators (5) which allow it to cope with demand peaks. From the power plant, the heat,
in the form of hot water, is fed into the district heating network (6), made up of a closed circuit of underground
pipes. The hot water flows into the district heating network then onwards to individual homes. Here, thanks to
a heat exchanger (7), energy is used to heat the sanitary water of homes and heating systems. All this happens
without the loss of any water. After the heat has been released, the water goes back to the plant through the
district heating network (8) to be reheated and resume its cycle. In addition to heating private homes, the
district heating system meets the energy needs of many public buildings in the city, including the hospital (9).
