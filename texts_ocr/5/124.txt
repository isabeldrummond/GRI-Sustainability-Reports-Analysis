Alperia Sustainability Report 2019

Omissions: Complaint procedures

103-3 Evaluation of the management approach

For the large branches, the concession for which was renewed in 2011 (a total of 11 large plants), Alperia is
obliged to manage a monitoring system that measures the quality of the watercourse concerned. Water quality
monitoring is carried out in agreement with the Province of Bolzano. Any adjustments are made during the
year.

Emissions

103-1 Explanation and definition

This topic was identified as essential in the 2017 materiality analysis in terms of impact but, above all, by
stakeholders. Alperia’s direct impacts are generated by the operation of hydroelectric and district heating
plants and electricity distribution infrastructures.

103-2 The management approach and its components

Alperia aims to minimise noise pollution, electromagnetic fields and CO2 emissions deriving from its activities.
To this end, a reporting system structured at group level is under development, which will be followed by the
preparation of a comprehensive management approach to be published in the next Sustainability Report.
Alperia Ecoplus (which manages district heating), Alperia Greenpower and Alperia Vipower (which manage
hydroelectric power plants) run all the sites certified according to the ISO 14001:2015 standard. They are also
EMAS registered. This issue is coordinated centrally by the HSE department and then implemented in the
individual BUs. The relative budgets are drawn up internally.

103-3 Evaluation of the management approach
A structured reporting system is currently being developed for this topic. The evaluation and effectiveness of
the management approach will be described in detail from the next financial year.

Energy Consumption

103-1 Explanation and definition

This topic was identified as essential in the 2017 materiality analysis in terms of impact but, above all, by
stakeholders. Alperia’s direct impact is generated by the operation of hydroelectric and district heating plants
and electricity distribution infrastructures.

103-2 The management approach and its components

Alperia aims to promote energy- and system-efficiency (e.g. reduction of grid losses) and climate-friendly
energy use within the company itself. To this end, a reporting system structured at group level is currently
under development, which will be followed by the preparation of a comprehensive management approach to
be published in the next Sustainability Report. Alperia Ecoplus (which manages district heating), Alperia
Greenpower and Alperia Vipower (which manage hydroelectric power plants) run all the sites certified
according to the ISO 14001:2015 standard. They are also EMAS registered. This topic is coordinated centrally
by the HSE department and then implemented in the individual BUs. The relative budgets are drawn up
