Ensuring access for all to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy systems — We
invest in the development of sustainable energy solutions as well as in the modernisation of our plants
and networks. We plan to invest €400 million over a period of five years, in order to make our structures
even more resilient and reliable, even in the event of emergency or disruptions. It is our aim to primarily
generate our energy from renewable sources (we are already at 94% today). We involve our suppliers
in promoting sustainability and are developing new products such as green gas, services and business
lines to help our customers be more energy efficient. Together with Edyna, our distribution subsidiary,
we have planned to replace the meters of more than 200.000 customers with new-generation Smart
Meters, which will allow more efficient management of energy resources. This activity involves an
investment of over €41 million.

Building a resilient infrastructure and promoting innovation and equitable, responsible and
sustainable industrialisation — We have planned €88 million in investments for the Smart Region,
which will be self-financed until 2021. Further projects will digitise assets and processes, backed by an
investment of €18 million. We develop modern distribution networks, maintain and improve our systems,
promote Smart City and eMobility projects and support innovative research projects with our Innovation
Board and dedicated initiatives such as the Alperia Startup Factory.

Making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, durable and sustainable — We have
launched projects that will encourage the development of more energy-efficient and sustainable cities.
Examples include the Smart City project, investments in green mobility and expansion of the district
heating network in Merano and Bolzano.

Ensuring sustainable patterns of production and consumption — Through targeted marketing
measures and information campaigns, we aim to raise our customers’ awareness of more sustainable
consumption patterns and we strive to continuously develop our green product and service portfolio.
Our commitment to more responsible consumption also involves our suppliers, making sure that

production products meet sustainability standards. Lastly, we ensure that our communication is increasingly
transparent, socially and economically sustainable and even more central to the new business plan.
