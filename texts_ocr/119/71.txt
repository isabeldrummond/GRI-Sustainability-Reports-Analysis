Remuneration

SIT’s remuneration policy is based on incentive systems designed to acknowledge the commitment
and merits of its employees, to foster a sense of belonging, to attract talented resources and to align
the interests of personnel with the goal of creating sustainable value for shareholders in the medium
to long term.

To ensure fairness and transparency, SIT has aligned its remuneration system for Executives and
managers with the dimensional and organisational characteristics of the Group and with the market
in which it operates. Said remuneration includes a fixed annual component and a variable component,
which is linked to the achievement of specific performance objectives, including those of a non-
financial nature. The variable component is paid when the economic or pre-set individual results are
achieved via a Management By Objectives (MBO) incentive mechanism providing for the award of
annual bonuses for the achievement of quantitative and qualitative objectives.

In 2019, the Group updated its Management by Objectives policy, which oversees incentive plans
linked to business objectives.

In fact, the criterion to measure objectives has been revised and the maximum achievable value for
each objective has been set at 125%. A barrier threshold has also been introduced, which sees a failure
to reach 80% of the Group's EBITDA value invalidate the entire bonus.
