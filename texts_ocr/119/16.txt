 

SIT S.p.A. — Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at
December 31, 2019

 

Group profile

The SIT Group develops and manufactures instruments for the measurement of consumption and the
safety, comfort and performance of domestic gas appliances.

 

The head office is located in Padua, Italy, where SIT La Precisa was founded in 1953 by brothers
Pierluigi and Giancarlo de’ Stefani. SIT has approximately two thousand direct employees across six
production sites?, one logistics hub and 26 sales offices in Europe, America, Asia and Australia. 60% of
these workers are employed outside Italy.

Representative offices and sales branches are located across Europe, America, Asia and Oceania.

Production and applied research facilities are located in Italy (in Padua, Milan, Rovigo and
Montecassiano), the Netherlands (Hoogeveen), Romania (Brasov), Mexico (Monterrey) and China
(Suzhou).

The Group is a shining example of an enterprise that, over the years, has acquired an effective
managerial and international structure, and is now listed on the Italian Stock Exchange.

In addition to significant quality, innovation, know-how investments, product range expansions and
new market acquisitions, key factors in the SIT’s development as a leading operator in its field include
continuous improvements and increasing automation in facilities, machinery, structures and the
organisation of production processes.

2 The number of production sites here differs from the number given in the Consolidated Financial Statements, since it adopted a legal
entity-based approach, and therefore considers the production site in Romania both for SIT Romania and for Metersit Romania.
