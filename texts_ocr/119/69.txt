professional training and refresher programmes aimed at guaranteeing the achievement of
corporate goals.

ae erivE In addition to an annual training plan, a behavioural assessment

project was launched in 2019 that made use of an online tool.
Said assessment allowed the company to map the behavioural
preferences of its employees, with the aim of acquiring a

snapshot of current preferences, behavioural potential, and work team dynamics. In particular, the

tool allowed the company to map motivational needs, behaviours, independence and risk-taking skills,

as well as tenacity and judgement, using four dimensions: dominance, extroversion, patience and

formality.

The questionnaire was sent to all employees working at SIT’s Italian offices and is used when selecting

candidates who have been short-listed for roles to ensure their compatibility with company

requirements.

The assessment represents a better way to manage SIT's human capital and further develop the

company's talents.

The annual training plan ensures that all company employees are equipped with the necessary
technical, specialist and safety skills, and in 2019, it focused specifically on strengthening digital,
communication and lean transformation skills, as well as on security.

Following a digital assessment involving 308 users, the company and its employees became better
informed of their digital maturity both in terms of hard skills (digital skills) and mindset and attitude
(digital mindset) according to the dimensions shown in figure 1.
