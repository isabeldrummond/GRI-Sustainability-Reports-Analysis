Product Sustainability

 

Product quality and safety

In the entire history of the Group, rather than an objective to pursue, quality has been the actual
starting point.

The Group has two Quality Functions, one for the Heating division and one for the Metering division,
which, in addition to ensuring the normal control and prevention on processes and products,
continuously ensures that company processes are in line with the best standards in terms of quality,
safety and environmental certifications - including controls on hazardous substances and the sourcing
of materials from war zones.

SIT was among the first companies in Italy to achieve ISO 9001 Quality Certification, in 1988, and has,
over the years, pursued steady growth aimed at adapting to and often anticipating the emerging needs
of the market. In this regard, all of the Group’s operating facilities are certified to ISO 9001 in its latest
2015 revision’.

Monitoring by certification authorities has borne out the organisation's ability to keep product quality
consistent with the international standards of reference.

In order to maintain the certifications, the Group submits to annual notified body audits of its
Management System and corporate and production processes. This activity is supplemented by an
internal audit regularly conducted on all corporate processes and functions, and main suppliers. In
addition, SIT regularly analyses all customer feedback.

All Group companies are fully supported and encouraged in maintaining the corporate Quality System,
in order to ensure that they design, build, check and supply products with exactly the same degree of
care, competence and dedication.

To achieve this goal, the Group promotes the continuous improvement of the Quality System and the
development connected programmes, in order to optimise the control, efficiency and precision of its
processes.

The commitment to investing in quality is essential in order to compete in the global market, and even
more so for a Group that designs, produces and sells components and products for which safety is a
fundamental element.

Quality and safety constitute the earliest stages in a product’s life cycle, involving the very latest
methods to improve robustness and prevent errors that might otherwise lead to higher costs if not
identified in time. The Group also provides for continuous and strict controls on the safety of its
products.

On an annual basis, corporate quality goals are defined and then formalised in an Annual Quality Plan.
The KPls of such goals include the quality of the finished product as perceived by customers, the
efficiency of internal processes, and the performance of suppliers. During the year, performances are
continuously monitored against targets in order to verify project progress and identify new actions
deemed necessary.
