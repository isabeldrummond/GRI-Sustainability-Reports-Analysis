MeteRfit Smart Gas Metering Division

The SIT S.p.A. company MeteRSit specialises in the development, production and distribution of latest
generation, electronic, static, remote and remote-controlled gas meters for gas distribution
companies. These products improve the way gas is measured, sold and used, therefore improving the
transparency of relations between utility companies and end customers.

Smart electronic meters are indeed a key element of new systems. By improving consumption
awareness, they allow end customers to optimise their own energy use and actively participate in the
energy market.

The gas meters can be managed remotely and directly provide consumption measurements in the m?
standard.

The range:

Residential market: G4 — G6
Industrial and commercial market: G10 — G16 — G25
