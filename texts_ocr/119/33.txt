Corporate Governance

The organisational and governance structure of the Group has evolved over time in keeping with its

roles, responsibilities and committees defined in procedures and policies, as required by legislation
applicable to listed companies.

SIT S.p.A.’s Corporate Governance System comprises the following corporate boards:

e the Board of Directors, appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting, plays a fundamental role in
setting and pursuing the Company’s and Group’s strategic objectives;

e the Board of Statutory Auditors, also appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting, performs a
supervisory role.

e The Shareholders’ Meeting considers motions on the matters reserved to it in accordance with
law and the By-Laws.

The audit of accounts was awarded to an independent audit firm, appointed by the Shareholders’
Meeting on the reasoned opinion of the Board of Statutory Auditors.
