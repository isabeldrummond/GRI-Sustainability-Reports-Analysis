 

SIT S.p.A. — Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at
December 31, 2019

In the Model, the companies have established an organisational system to prevent offences by
identifying the most sensitive activities and defining strict rules of conduct to which recipients must
comply. It is a firm belief in fact of the Group that a business model oriented to compliance with the
entire regulatory reference framework supports the achievement of significant economic results
destined to last over time.

The Supervisory Board (also “SB”) for the Model, established in each of the two companies, has the
task of: (i) Monitoring compliance with its provisions by all Recipients; (ii) Analysing and evaluating its
effectiveness in preventing offences; (iii) Performing regular checks on the main actions performed in
risk areas; (iv) Collecting, processing and storing all information relevant to the performance of its
functions; (v) Reporting to top management any violations of the rules of conduct; and (vi) Proposing
to the Board of Directors updates to the Model to accommodate changes in corporate organisational
structure or in the reference regulatory framework.

For the performance of such tasks, the Supervisory Board is invested with all powers of initiative and
control of all company activities and personnel, and reports to the Board of Directors through its
Chairman at least annually.

Finally, the companies make two channels available, one of which electronic, and both addressed to
the Supervisory Board, for Model recipients to report any observed irregularities, in accordance with
the latest regulations on the subject of “Whistleblowing” (i.e. Law 179/2017, Article 6, Paragraph 2-
bis).

The fight against corruption

SIT has adopted a series of methods and tools for mitigating corruption risks in corporate activities
that, due to their very nature, have greater exposure to such risks.

The Group has thus implemented a control and monitoring system designed to guarantee compliance
with the main anti-corruption regulations at a national and international level.

Following are, by way of non-exhaustive example, the main safeguards underlying this control and
monitoring system:

e The Ethics Code;

e The set of Group Procedures, Policies and Operative guidelines that govern the
performance of activities within a particular process. These Procedures, Policies and
Operative guidelines represent direct (e.g. Procurement Procedure) or indirect (e.g.
Supplier Database Management) safeguards of the control and monitoring system; the
internal control system pursuant to Law 262/05;

e The Organisation, Management and Control Model pursuant to Legislative Decree
231/01;

e The configuration of information systems, with particular reference to the use of a single
ERP at Group level, based on the fundamental principles of:

- segregation of duties,
- automated management of the main financial transactions;
- Management of adequate authorisation profiles for payments;

e The system of Delegations and Powers that precisely defines roles and responsibilities
within the corporate organisational structure.
