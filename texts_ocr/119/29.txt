Sustainability for SIT

 

Approach to sustainability

SIT, aware of the growing importance of sustainability and its impact on local areas and communities,
has made a commitment to sustainability with a view to guaranteeing continuous improvements in
the management of economic, environmental and social aspects.

Each Group company pursues the goal of creating value for all stakeholder, combining economic
performance with quality products and attention to social and environmental sustainability.

Through the Sustainability Report, the Group intends to transparently inform stakeholders of its
commitment to holding a social and participative role in relation to local areas and communities, its
human resources and environmental impacts deriving from its activities.

In the preparation of the Sustainability Report, in addition to its own activities, SIT has carefully
considered the interests and expectations of stakeholders. In order to systematically and
comprehensively select topics to report on in this document, in 2018, SIT identified the most pertinent
stakeholder categories for the Group and defined a materiality matrix for the aspects and expectations
most relevant to the Group and to the stakeholders respectively. The results of this materiality analysis
(relevant topics and stakeholders) were approved by the Board of Directors.
