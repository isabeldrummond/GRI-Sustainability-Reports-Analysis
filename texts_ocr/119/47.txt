December 31, 2019
University of Padua and the University of Ferrara, and with leading global players in co-design and
development activities.
These opportunities have allowed SIT to keep pace with global technological developments,
developing and exploiting new competences and products both with and for its own customers.
Numerous research collaborations with universities are currently active on the development of
innovative technologies aimed at significantly reducing energy consumption and pollution, while
guaranteeing ever better temperature control comfort for users.

Heating Division

Within the Heating division, the research is focused on the development of electronic and mechanical
solutions that are increasingly integrated, intelligent, able to communicate with the external
environment through the most modern internet of things technology (IOT), easy to use and, at the
same time capable of maximising comfort performance while reducing energy consumption as much
as possible.

During 2019, the main projects included:

e The development of an innovative Combustion Management System (CMS) valve able to
significantly increase modulation ratio performance, allowing for more precise adjustments
and greater energy savings;

e The development of a new air+gas supply system architecture for condensing boilers aimed
at increasing performance while minimising the use of space and materials;

e The development of a new valve platform for domestic boilers with a simplified and versatile
architecture adaptable and customisable to various applications and markets in a shorter time
and with less production investment requirements;

e Anew fan platform for compact, low-cost condensing boilers.

e Expansion of the range of adapters and bends used to connect the various boiler models.

SIT was chosen by BOSCH Termotechnik as its technological partner to develop a hydrogen boiler
safety and control valve as part of the UK government Hy4Heat programme. The Hy4Heat
programme is part of the United Kingdom’s national “heating decarbonisation” plan, which
evaluates the use of hydrogen appliances as a means of reducing CO2 emissions through the use
of decarbonised gas. Hydrogen, compared to natural gas, faces significant technological
challenges as it is a lighter gas, has a considerably higher flame speed, a greater flammability range
and burns at a higher temperature. It therefore requires specially designed and tested appliances
and components. To overcome these challenges, SIT has developed a new product called Sigma -
generation H, which has been approved for use with hydrogen, both in terms of materials and
functions, by the KIWA Notified Body. The technological partnership with Bosch involves the
production of valves which can be used with hydrogen for installation in boilers, with prototypes
to be ready in March 2020 and - once approved by Hy4Heat - subsequently to be tested in the
field in 2021.
