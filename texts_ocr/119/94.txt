SIT S.p.A. — Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at
December 31, 2019

Deloitte.

a) with regards to qualitative information included in the NFS, and specifically with reference to the
business management model, policies applied and main risks, we carried out interviews and
gathered supporting documentation in order to verify its consistency with the available evidence;

b) with regards to quantitative information, we carried out both analytical procedures and limited
verifications in order to ensure, on 2 sample basis, the correct aggregation of data.

For the companies SIT S.p.A. (Montecassiano) and S.C, MeteRSit Romania S.r.|., S.C.SIT Romania
S.rl., which we selected based on their activities, their contribution to the performance indicators at
the consolidated level and their location, we carried out site visits, during which we have met their
management and have gathered supporting documentation with reference to the correct application
of procedures and calculation methods used for the indicators.

Conclusion

Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of
the SIT Group as of December 31, 2019 is not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with articles
3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI Standards.
