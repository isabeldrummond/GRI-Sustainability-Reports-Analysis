Figure 2. SIT Leadership Model - expected skills

Once an aspirational leadership model was defined, a performance management process was
launched to improve leadership skills, promote mutual transparency through feedback, encourage a
meritocratic culture, and to allow for the personal and professional growth of all SIT employees.

The project focused solely on the management team during 2019, but will be rolled out to the rest of
the workforce in 2020.

and clarity for its personnel. Assignment schemes do not vary according to different contractual forms
(e.g. full-time, part-time, fixed-term or open-ended contract), but may vary according to different
geographical areas, depending on reference standards that may include or exclude certain services.
SIT is attentive to the well-being and work-life balance of its employees. For this reason, it allows,
where possible, flexitime schemes in Italian branches.

As for support for families, the Group provides new mothers and fathers with a baby welcome kit
containing some useful baby care items. The main benefits include: Life Insurance, Health Insurance,
Pension Plans, Food Vouchers.

the National Metalworking Collective Bargaining Agreement. Furthermore, from 2018, as per
applicable bargaining, it has been possible for personnel to allocate part or all of the value of individual
performance bonuses to corporate welfare, thus increasing the opportunities to use the available
