Following the roll out of application systems and the transition to Office 365, the company invested
1,624 hours in training around 203 of its employees in order to facilitate their technological transition
and to allow them to engage in new means of collaboration. Furthermore, 24 ambassadors were
identified and subsequently provided with 480 hours of training to improve their trainer skills and
assist employee training on digital skills.

Training to improve digital skills began in 2019, with the aim of strengthening communication skills,
and is expected to end in 2020. 33 people were involved in 528 hours of training focused on effective
collaboration and communication.

The year continued with the strengthening of lean manufacturing skills, which saw 385 employees
involved in 1,540 hours of training on 5S methodology. The plan will continue into 2020, with the aim
of training a pool of employees to achieve their green, yellow and black belts, thereby allowing them
to promote change at an international level.

Workplace safety training is consistently and continuously provided, involving around 318 staff in a
total of 3,258 hours in 2019.

Following changes made to the Company's Vision and Mission, several meetings were organised in
Italy (for 90 middle and senior managers), the Netherlands, Romania and Mexico, involving all white-
collar workers, in order to illustrate world economic scenarios and relevant market developments,
and to explain the Company’s new strategic guidelines.

Overall, more than 10,549 training hours were provided to employees at SIT S.p.A. and Metersit S.r.l.,
while 47,445 hours were provided to employees at a Group level.

In order to further develop the Group's human capital, a review of employee management processes
continued into 2019 with the aim of standardising and digitising procedures using the Success Factors
tool dedicated to HR processes.

A module has been introduced to manage online MBO workflows. Said model is currently being linked
to the primary regional pay systems in order to create a single database in the Employee Central
module.
