December 31, 2019

Risk regarding the failure to protect workplace health and safety

Safety is one of the founding values of SIT in the conception and development of its products, and in
the performance of its activities. For this reason, risks associated with the safety of users and workers,
and with accidental events, such as fires or floods, are constantly identified and monitored.

Guidelines and risk management and mitigation methods

Workplace safety aspects are regularly managed in compliance with applicable regulations in the
various countries in which SIT operates. In particular, the Safety Plan is prepared half-yearly which
describes for each Italian industrial site the activities carried out in relation to the existing regulations
and establishes objectives to be achieved in the subsequent three-year period. Contemporaneously,
for the Italian facilities, the Safety Audit document is also issued concerning the previous half-year.
SIT is committed to the continual application of increasingly modern and efficient technical safety
rules, with the objective to reduce injuries levels.

Much importance is given to injuries prevention through the regular workplace safety training and
refresher courses for workers.

Risks concerning a failure to respect human rights

Risk factors in this category are linked to the possibility of directly or indirectly violating the inalienable
human rights of employees, suppliers or customers.

Guidelines and risk management and mitigation methods
To address such risks, in addition to the Group defining a Code of Conduct, in September 2017, the
Board of Directors approved a Code of Non-Discrimination and Diversity and a Code of Basic Working
Conditions, which have been circulated to all employees and published on the Intranet and on the
corporate website. Furthermore, in its qualification process, SIT requires suppliers to subscribe to its
Ethics code for suppliers and Third-party intermediaries.

Bribery and corruption risk

The possibility of ethically improper conduct by employees, suppliers or customers, with particular
reference to corruption, represents one of the risks most central to the attention of the Group’s
control processes. It is a firm belief of the Group that a business model oriented to compliance with
the entire regulatory reference framework supports the achievement of significant economic results
destined to last over time.

Guidelines and risk management and mitigation methods

In this regard, SIT S.p.A and MeteRSit S.r.| have adopted an organisation, management and control
model as per Legislative Decree 231/2001. With this model, the company intends to implement an
organisational system aimed at preventing offences through the identification of sensitive activities
and the establishment of specific rules of conduct, such as those enshrined in the Ethics Code, to which
employees are strictly bound. Furthermore, in compliance with the provisions of recent regulations
on the subject of “whistleblowing”, two channels, one traditional and the other electronic mail, have
been made available to the recipients of the aforementioned model to allow reporting to a
Supervisory Body of any encountered irregularities.
