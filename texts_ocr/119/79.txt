Diversity, equal opportunities and non-discrimination
Non-discrimination

The “Code of Non-discrimination and Diversity”, drafted and approved in 2017, is a formal policy and
a firm commitment by SIT to its employees, the recipients of its products, services and programmes
and, in general, to any individual coming into contact in any way with the SIT Group.

SIT has, since its inception, been firmly committed to creating an environment free of discrimination,
in which:

e Responsible parties seek to guarantee equal opportunities;

e Diversity is considered a resource and never an impediment;

e Respect for the dignity, honour and freedom of individuals in their rights to self-determination
is a natural logical and ethical prerequisite of daily actions.

Discrimination for the purposes of the Code is given to mean any treatment creating an intimidating,
hostile, offensive, less favourable and/or less ideal environment for one party with respect to another
based on any discriminatory conduct, whether, by way of non-exhaustive example, active or passive,
direct or indirect, internal or external, or emerging as a result of any form of bullying, harassment,
retaliation, intimidation or persecution. These behaviours are listed above by way of example and are
by no means exhaustive.

SIT’s Human Resources department undertakes the responsibility to ensure compliance with such
fundamental principles in the SIT Group’s activities, and to adequately resolve any cases of
discrimination, failure to ensure equal opportunities, bullying, harassment, retaliation or intimidation.

The Group’s commitment to diversity can be noted in the significant percentages of women and
younger employees in all professional categories.
