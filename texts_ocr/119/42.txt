Creation of value for stakeholder

The economic value generated by the Group, and consequently distributed to stakeholder, derives
from the calculation of generated and distributed value. This is determined for the reference period
from the value generated from service and product sales and other income (e.g. financial income,
other revenues) net of amortisation and write-downs, and from the distributed value, in various
forms, to Group stakeholder.

The calculation is based on the income statement used in the Group’s consolidated financial
statements at December 31, 2019.

Thus, in 2019, SIT generated an economic value amounting to Euro 351.360 million, redistributed to
the communities, personnel, public administrations, suppliers and lenders.
