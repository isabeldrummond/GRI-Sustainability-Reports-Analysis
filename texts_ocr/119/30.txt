December 31, 2019

Stakeholder engagement

A rigorous sustainability strategy requires the identification of stakeholder through their relevance to
the organisation. SIT identified stakeholder categories through an analysis of various companies
operating in the reference industrial sector. The Group selected stakeholder by considering its
business activities and social role in the countries in which it operates.

Significant stakeholders were thus identified to include: shareholders, investors, lenders, customers,
employees, consultants, governments, public administrations, institutions, regulators, suppliers,
subcontractors, commercial partners, trade unions, local communities, wider communities, the
media, universities, research centres, and trade associations. Following identification of the
stakeholder, SIT proceeded to rank them according to their dependence and influence on the Group.
