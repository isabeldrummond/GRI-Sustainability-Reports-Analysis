supports scientific research into
glioblastoma.

For the Padua Marathon, SIT
provided over 400 t-shirts to its
participants in the competition,
which featured the logos of SIT
and the Luca Ometto
Association. Indeed, SIT, through
its participation in the marathon,
once again supported the
association founded by Valentina
Ometto with the aim of raising
funding for scientific
glioblastoma research in order to
improve the effectiveness of
treatments and the quality of life
of patients and their families.

To celebrate Christmas at the
Padua, Rovigo, Montecassiano
and Milan sites, a gift pack was
given to all employees containing
a panettone purchased from the
Luca Ometto Association. As
many as 1000 packages were
delivered.

area. An edutainment event was
organised for the citizens of
Padua in 2019 (further details are
provided in the chapter on
“employer branding").
