People Attraction

SIT pays particular attention to its Employee Value Proposition (EVP), which essentially consists of the
experience had by employees and potential candidates in the workplace. EVP is rated based on the
company’s intrinsic characteristics, its brand identity, its corporate culture and the relationship it has
with its employees. EVP finds its primary expression in the way SIT designs and manages its
recruitment process. In fact, the recruitment process does not discriminate with regard to gender,
religion, personal beliefs, race, ethnic origin, disability, age, sexual orientation or personal politics.

In addition, stable and long-lasting employment relationships are considered fundamental in fostering
the growth of the company, as well as constituting a significant motivational factor.
In 2019, 11 people were hired on permanent contracts for the various departments of SIT S.p.A. and
MeteRSit Srl.

Attracting new talent is critical in guaranteeing the innovation that distinguishes the Group and
maintaining its market leading position. The company carries out recruiting activities for young talent
through monthly assessments. Said assessments take place at the Group’s headquarters and offer
individuals the opportunity to present their organisation, business and values.

The assessments are divided into several phases, including ice breakers, which allow candidates to try
their hand at presenting themselves in alternative ways. The process also involves a numbers-based
role play to evaluate problem-solving and team-work skills, in addition to one-on-one interviews and
in-trays, which see candidates attempt to solve business problems.

The Human Resources department also motivates current SIT Group employees to get involved with
recruitment activities through two internal initiatives: the Internal Job Posting and Referral
programme.

Through the Internal Job Posting programme, SIT makes job positions available to all of its Italian and
international employees, encouraging those interested in changing roles to submit an application. By
doing so, SIT hopes to encourage professional growth among those with a desire to develop their
professional career by engaging in new experiences.

SIT’s Referral programme, on the other hand, offers bonuses to employees who help identify
candidates for the profiles sought by the company.

For all new hires, SIT provides a Customised Induction programme aimed at immediately transmitting
corporate values and product and process knowledge. The induction programme is customised in a
