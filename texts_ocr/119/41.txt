Economic Sustainability

 

As for business performance, revenues and income for the year show that sales dropped by 2.1%
compared to 2018. The consolidated sales figures reflect different trends within the two Divisions.

Heating Division sales of Euro 260.0 million were down 8.6% on the previous year, mainly due to the
decline on the European and Asian markets and only partially offset by good performance in the US
market - expanding +12.0% (+6.6% at like-for-like exchange rates).

The Smart Gas Metering Division also continued to acquire new orders in 2019 and consolidate its
market position. In 2019, revenues amounted to Euro 88.6 million, up 23.1% on Euro 72.0 million in
2018. In Q4 alone, sales were up 25.7%.

In geographical terms, the Group received approximately 38%, or Euro 135.1 million, of its total
turnover from Italy. Of the remaining Euro 217.1 million, around 38% and 24% are respectively
attributable to the rest of Europe (excluding Italy) and the other countries in which the Group
operates”.
