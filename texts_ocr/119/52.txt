December 31, 2019

Environmental Sustainability

 

SIT focuses closely on protecting the collective interest and therefore considers the environment and
nature as fundamental and a shared heritage to be protected and defended. SIT is committed to
adopting responsible behaviour in terms of environmental protection, acting strictly in compliance
with applicable environmental rules, in addition to the limit established by any authorisations and
provisions received from the competent authorities and refraining from behaviour which damages the
environment.

Furthermore, the Group is committed to raising awareness among employees, consultants,
collaborators and all those who operate in its name and on its behalf regarding the protection of the
environment and the minimisation of negative impacts.

One of the Group’s two Rovigo facilities performs aluminium casting, mechanical processing, surface
treatments, the electromechanical assembly of gas safety, control and regulation systems, and safety
and temperature control thermo-sensitive component production. The other facilities in Rovigo,
Brasov (Romania), Monterrey (Mexico) and Suzhou (China) perform the electromechanical assembly
of gas safety, control and regulation systems. The Hoogeveen (Netherlands) facility produces
electronic controls. Electric fans are produced at the Montecassiano (MC) plant for heating purposes,
home appliances, and fume exhaust kits.

SIT has implemented an Environmental Management System (EMS) at its production facilities in
Rovigo (Italy), Monterrey (Mexico) and Brasov (Romania), which are certified to ISO 14001:2015?”. The
system defines specific monitoring and control procedures, assigns clear roles and responsibilities,
and guarantees active communications with stakeholder and control bodies. The system also requires
the production facilities to annually define initiatives to improve environmental performances.
Considerable importance is given to the provisions in place at the Group's sites to ensure immediate
action is taken in case of an environmental emergency. Said provisions guarantee a prompt response
in the case of an injury so as avoid or minimise any environmental impact.

In 2019, further initiatives were implemented to reduce the Group’s environmental impact by
eliminating or reducing the use of polluting substances. In addition to continuing actions implemented
in previous years, the Rovigo plant (where aluminium die-casting is carried out) has replaced its old
die-casting washing system with a new one that uses modified alcohol instead of tetrachlorethylene.
As such, the plant has significantly reduced its use of this particularly dangerous solvent.

17 It should be noted that MeteRSit’s facilities were upgraded to the ISO 14001:2015 certification in 2018.
