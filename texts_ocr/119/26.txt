 

SIT S.p.A. — Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at
December 31, 2019

The facilities in Rovigo (Italy), Brasov (Romania) and Monterrey (Mexico) have all been certified to
environmental standard ISO 14001:2015’, which involves all levels of the organisation in guaranteeing
and constantly improving environmental conditions in the contexts in which it operates, in terms of
both pollution prevention and compliance with industry regulations. Furthermore, the Rovigo die-
casting plant has attained renewal of its Integrated Environmental Authorisation, in accordance with
the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive.

The Group’s production facilities have implemented organisational controls and specific internal
procedures for preventive actions, the monitoring the specific environmental aspects, and actions
aimed at managing any environmental emergencies.

In this regard, prior to renovation work on buildings at 31-33 Viale dell’ Industria in Padua, SIT detected
that the threshold concentration of some pollutants had been exceeded in the groundwater, which is
presumably owing to historical contamination. The competent bodies were informed. Following
approval from said bodies and with their collaboration, SIT promptly implemented emergency safety
measures and is now working with the authorities to clean up the areas affected by contamination.

The Group is also engaged in energy saving initiatives through investments and plant maintenance
consistent with energy saving policies.

Climate change risks that may affect company performance

SIT is a key manufacturer of control, safety, performance and consumption measurement tools for gas
appliances. The components and systems produced by SIT are key to monitoring the energy efficiency
and CO; emissions of devices produced by its customers. SIT products form an integral part of cutting-
edge infrastructures (smart grids) in the metering sector.

As such, SIT plays an active part in public debate. The Group also collaborates with technical and
commercial partners to define and assess the impact of climate change in the short and medium to
long term.

According to the methodology used by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD)
for the Financial Stability Board, the main transition risks to which SIT is exposed are as follows:

e legal policies and risks associated with new mandatory product standards;

e technological risks due to the emergence of alternative technologies to gas;

e market risks due to a shift in market demand towards applications with reduced CO2 emissions.
SIT natively incorporates the assessment and mitigation of these medium- to long-term risks into the
governance of its corporate strategy and its risk management process. Primary actions in this regard

involve product innovation and an ever closer collaboration with leading customers to co-develop
their new platforms.

SIT does not currently see the other risk categories defined by the TFCD (physical, acute or chronic
risks) as material at this time.

7 It should be noted that MeteRSit’s facilities were upgraded to the ISO 14001:2015 certification in 2018.
