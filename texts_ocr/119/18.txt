*The number of production sites here differs from the number given in the Consolidated Financial Statements, since it adopted a legal
entity-based approach, and therefore considers the production site in Romania both for SIT Romania and for Metersit Romania.

3 Agents and distributors are not considered within the scope of the data and information in this document.
