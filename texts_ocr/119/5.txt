 

SIT S.p.A. — Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at
December 31, 2019

As a listed company, we are seeing our stock market value come under severe strain, just as many
other listed companies are. As such, | ask our shareholders and investors to remember that the current
situation requires careful assessment and evaluation. Our performance on the stock market during
this critical period does not reflect the value we are able to generate.

Finally, | would like to thank all employees at SIT for their clarity and professionalism during this time
of incredible uncertainty. You should all pride yourselves on the work you do every day.

When | look back at 2019, | see a lot of hard work, achievements and satisfaction. Much has been
done, and much remains to be done. Among the numerous projects in the pipeline for 2020 is the new
SIT headquarters in Padua, intended as a campus for testing gases with a lower environmental impact
in collaboration with our customers, partners, local residents and those working in the energy and
climate sectors.

For SIT, the future after COVID-19 is fraught with challenges: how to create growth opportunities, how
to manage energy transition, market dynamics, digital transformation and evolution in the ways we
work, the places we work from, and the tools we use.

We relish challenges, and we’re really looking forward to becoming a key player in the field.
Let's enjoy the ride, and | wish you all the best in your work.

Federico de’ Stefani

CEO & Chairman
