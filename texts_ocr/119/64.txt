SIT S.p.A. — Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at
December 31, 2019

Information and training are of extreme value and importance, and where possible, these activities
are carried out by expert in-house employees, with the aim of raising awareness among the workforce.
In 2019, numerous training courses were held for all direct and indirect personnel in Italy and in Group
facilities in other countries, not only on safety, but also on emergency situation management,
including first aid and fire prevention.

The Group maintains constant collaboration with workers’ representatives through regular scheduled
meetings aimed at the joint assessment of health and safety risks. Improvement actions are shared
during these meetings, taking into account any potential organisational changes.

Injury data for 2019 highlight the Group’s effective commitment to reducing its employee in rate. Said
commitment takes the form of technical measures, such as increasing automation and designing
appropriate workstations, as well as enlisting expert employees to provide specific training. These
training activities are carried out by in-house members of staff with knowledge of the risks associated
with the tasks performed on site.

A total of 10 work related injuries occurred across the Group’s facilities during 2019. No injury with
high consequences occurred **.

The considerable decrease in work related injuries rates compared to last year - although somewhat
owed to reduced operating hours - is the result of SIT’s constant compliance with regulations and a
desire to continuously improve health and safety.

The number of work-related injuries has fallen significantly compared to 2018, when there were 13
injuries involving company cars.

Injuries were predominantly due to injuries involving impacts, crushing and efforts to lift and move
loads.
