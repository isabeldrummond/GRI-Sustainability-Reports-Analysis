As evidenced by the above table, SIT tends to position itself above the standard pay of the reference
country in order to attract talent and maintain competitiveness. Furthermore, there are no gender
differences in the standard wage and the local minimum wage.

In 2018, a Long-Term Incentive System (LTI) was also implemented for the top management of the
Group, in line with the Corporate Governance Code guidelines for listed companies. This plan has the
objective to align the performance objectives of management with the achievement of the objective
of the creation of value for the shareholders in the medium-long term period.

As approved by Board of Directors’ motion of April 26, 2018, the plan has a horizon of 3 years (2018-
2020) and involves the award of performance shares according to SIT’s cumulative 2018-2020 EBITDA
and the market conditions at the end of the period. The plan involves 38 SIT team members.

A performance management process has been launched in conjunction with the traditional incentive
scheme in order to promote increasingly excellent results.

The SIT Leadership Model has been created based on the following four dimensions: Lead People,
Lead Performance, Lead Business and Lead Innovation. These four dimensions are broken down into
the categories shown in figure 2.

43 Significant countries are those in which the Group has at least one production facility. The local minimum wage was taken from collective
bargaining agreements in the respective countries where the individual facilities are located.
