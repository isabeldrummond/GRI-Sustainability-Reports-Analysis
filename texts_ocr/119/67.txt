Employer Branding

With the aim of attracting the very best talent, the Parent Company has established strong and fruitful
collaborative relationships with numerous Italian universities.

During 2019, SIT funded a research project in collaboration with the Industrial Engineering
Department at the University of Padua, aimed at selecting materials for valve components resistant
to aggressive gaseous environments.

The company also participated in 10 events sponsored by the careers services at various Italian
universities. During these events, SIT met with professional consultancy companies operating
nationally, as well as students interested in job offers or internships organised by the University of
Padua, the Polytechnic University of Milan, the CUOA Foundation and ISTUD Business School.

In addition to participating in career days organised by universities, SIT directly plans "orienteering"
events with the aim of establishing special relationships with students and recent graduates. The
objective is to help inform young people about the opportunities available on the job market today,
as well as to provide them with useful information on the skills required by companies and to
encourage the exchange of information between companies and students in terms of their mutual
expectations.

During 2019, four school-work experience schemes and twenty-two curricular/extracurricular
internships were organised at SIT’s Italian offices for university students, two of which involved the
writing of a dissertation.

The University of Padua also awarded SIT a prize for having the “best on-campus recruiting activities"
thanks to the internships it worked to arrange in 2019.

The company further strengthened its brand on the labour market by targeting students at universities
in Padua and the Veneto region. The project was broken down into several phases over the course of
the year and saw the involvement of Parent Company employees. Interviews and focus groups were
conducted to allow employees to give their opinion on the values they consider intrinsic to SIT’s
company culture. Four specific concepts were identified, all of which have been developed around the
word ‘made,’ and form the basis for the company's communication strategy.

The Group’s four ‘made‘ concepts are as follows:

- Made to Matter, which is tied to issues regarding business identity, such as energy efficiency,
re-use and recycling, low environmental impact, and product and employee safety;

- Made by Us, which focuses on competence, attention to detail and the work carried out by
employees, who represent the heart of our company;

- Made with Care, which highlights a company culture based on well-being, professional
growth, and maintaining relationships;

- Made of Future, because we cannot ignore the importance of innovation and the
transformations taking place in the lean and digital fields, which in turn require us to
consistently assess how the human-work-future relationship may change;

The Group’s communication campaign involved all primary social media channels, with the sharing of

all four ‘made’ concepts through the use of graphic, audio and video materials. The campaign
culminated at the end of the year with the
