December 31, 2019

Methodological note

 

This document represents the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (hereinafter also “NFS” or
“Sustainability Report”) of SIT (hereinafter also “the Group” or “SIT Group”), prepared in compliance
with the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 (hereinafter also the
“Decree”). The NFR aims to transparently describe the initiatives and main results achieved in terms
of sustainability performance during the 2019 financial year (from January 1 to December 31).

As envisaged by Art. 5 of Legislative Decree 254/16, this document is a separate report containing
specific wording in order to bring it in line with the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement required by
law.

To the extent necessary to guarantee an understanding of business activities, and their performance,
results and impact, the Sustainability Report covers environmental, social, personnel, human rights
and bribery and corruption issues relevant to the Group and identified in the materiality matrix in the
document chapter entitled “Sustainability for SIT”.

This Sustainability Report was prepared in compliance with the “Global Reporting Initiative
Sustainability Reporting Standards” defined in 2016 by the Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI), according
to the “in accordance - Core” option. The Group has adopted the most recent version of the GRI 403
Standard (Occupational Health and Safety), released in 2018. In addition, for the preparation of this
document reference was also made to the European Commission's Guidelines on non-financial
information. The “GRI Content Index”, which details the contents reported in accordance with GRI
standards, can be found in the Annex of this document.

Information on Climate Change is broken down into the Group's management approach and the
associated environmental risks. In the future, SIT is committed to supplementing its analysis with
changes to environmental legislation, as well as the effects generated and suffered by the Group with
regard to Climate Change.

With reference to economic data reported, the scope is the same as for the SIT Consolidated Financial
Statements as of December 31, 2019.

The scope of qualitative information and quantitative data regarding social and environmental aspects
includes the companies consolidated line-by-line in the SIT Consolidated Financial Statements as of
December 31, 2019. Any changes to the above indicated perimeter are duly reported in the document,
and, in any case, do not compromise the adequate representation of the business.

In 2019, no significant changes in relation to the size, organisational structure, ownership structure
and supply chain of the Group took place.

In order to facilitate Group data comparability and performance assessments over time, comparisons
are made where possible with the 2018 reporting year. The document also includes information
relating to previous reporting years still applicable at December 31, 2019. The restatement of the
comparative data previously published is clearly indicated as such.

The process of collecting data and information for this document has been managed in collaboration
with the various company divisions of SIT, with the aim of facilitating a clear and precise indication of
the information considered significant for stakeholders in accordance with the GRI Standards’
reporting principles between positive and negative aspects of balance, comparability, accuracy,
timeliness, clarity and reliability.
