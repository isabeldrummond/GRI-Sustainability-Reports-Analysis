Letter to the Stakeholders

 

Dear Shareholders and Stakeholders,

In 2019, the SIT Group reached several important milestones, and remains a leading international
brand.

We’re well aware that in order to strengthen our work and grow as a Group, we need to focus on
sustainability. SIT’s ultimate aim is to create value for all its stakeholders. This means placing operating
results alongside ethical performance, prioritising the creation of high-quality products and awareness
of the social and environmental impact of its work. Creating value through work is part of our DNA,
both for the business itself and for all those who form part of its social, economic and production
ecosystems. This is why we feel it necessary to underline this philosophy through an update to our
mission:

“Our commitment is to create smart solutions for climate control and consumption measurement for
a more sustainable world”

This builds on our previous mission, which was as follows:

“SIT develops and manufactures measuring devices and systems for the safety, comfort and
performance of domestic gas equipment”

As such, we’re hoping to define ourselves less as a market leader in the gas sector, and more as a
Group that creates intelligent climate control solutions. In fact, market and government developments
are encouraging us all to explore methane gas alternatives, and we have also been consistently
implementing plans to reduce CO emissions. We are already designing and developing products that
are compatible with alternative fuels, such as biomethane and hydrogen. Likewise, we also hope to
keep our finger on the pulse with regard to future energy scenarios that might benefit from our
expertise.

Our new mission sees measuring consumption as the first step towards conserving and managing
scarce resources. In the ten years since its foundation, MeteRSIT has become a key player in the world
of smart gas metering. Our quality services and expertise are recognised worldwide. And why should
we limit ourselves to the gas and heating sectors? As a Group, we're equipped to carry out incredibly
precise measurements, and as such, we can use our expertise to measure other components and make
the most of new opportunities.

Within this context, we want to be the leading partner in energy and climate control solutions. We
aim to be a sustainable, tech-savvy partner devoted to innovation and quality. A partner that
collaborates with customers to develop effective solutions. In 2019, we ran an MBO programme with
the aim of assigning sustainability objectives to our managers. The programme will be rolled out to
additional employees in 2020.

SIT is committed to growing with the communities in which it operates. During 2019, we made
important progress in terms of our employees and the supply chain, as detailed in this report.

As | write these words, the world is going through a time of great uncertainty. The Coronavirus
emergency affects each and every one of us. At SIT, a Crisis Committee has been set up to protect
employee safety. The Committee is taking all the necessary steps to safeguard our resources and to
mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business in a timely manner.
