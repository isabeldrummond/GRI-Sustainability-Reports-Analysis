Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions

In terms of energy consumption, SIT is increasingly committed to managing the use of energy from
different sources in its production processes.

The Group's activities mainly involve the use of electricity and methane gas.

The Group’s mechanical workshop in Padua was moved to a new building constructed in Rovigo in
2019. The move represented an opportunity to install high-efficiency technological systems. In
addition to installing a 75kW peak photovoltaic system??, an energy-saving LED lighting system was
installed in the new building, along with a low-enthalpy underfloor heating system. These new utilities
have also been connected to a fairly new electricity distribution substation, which provides for more
efficient electricity consumption. The Group has also replaced one of its metal-treatment kilns with a
new model, consequently allowing for greater energy savings.

Energy consumption decreased by 13.2% in 2019 compared to the previous year. This decrease is
mainly due to an approximately 11% decrease in the Heating Division’s production volumes.

Regarding Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS)**, only the Monterrey facility keeps and uses such
substances in its plant. In particular, freon R22 refrigerant gas (normally used for cooling) is still used
in some machines, for a total of around 100kg. However, the use of this gas did not lead to any ozone-
damaging emissions in 2019, as no losses were recorded from the closed circuit during routine checks.

18 Following improvements in the reporting system, the 2018 figures relating to the consumption of electrical energy have been restated
compared to those published in the previous NFR.

19 The consumption of LPG used for testing is partly estimated for the gas tanks still in use at the end of the year.

20 The energy consumption in GJ was calculated using conversion coefficients from the Environment Ministry and the National Inventory
Report updated for the reporting year.

21 The 75kW peak photovoltaic system has not produced any energy as of the date of this report, since it has not yet been connected.

22 Substances indicated in the United Nations Environment Programme’s ‘Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer’,
1987.
