With #GetDigital we are helping to spread digital ,
skills through targeted projects that provide a

real contribution to our country's development.

 

This project is based on the desire to actively contribute

to reducing the cultural divide in which Italy still lags
behind other European countries, and to spur its
development.

To promote and encourage the transversal and specific
development of digital skills, Fastweb has focused its

energies on three key projects:

mu Fastweb Digital Academy, Fastweb Digital Academy,

the school for digital skills established with Cariplo
Factory in 2016;

m= Fastweb4School, the project that, since 2017, has
promoted entrepreneurship and digital creativity in
Italian schools;

= Digital IQ, the new self-assessment tool of digital
skills and aptitude for people and companies.

From this perspective, the company also expresses
its commitment through the organization of events
and meetings throughout the country to publicize the
importance of digital technologies in Italy.
