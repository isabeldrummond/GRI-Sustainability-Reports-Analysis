FORTHE GOALS

 

With 5G service testing in Bari, Matera and
Rome, our company is an integral part

in the transformation of the cities of the
future. The aim is to develop new services
and applications suited to smarter,

more people-oriented cities with lower
environmental impacts.

By monitoring greenhouse gas emissions
in all stages of the value chain, our
company is committed to tracking its
impact on climate change. The aim is to
develop services that drive the shift to a
low-environmental impact development
model.

Many of the projects kicked off during
the year were created through Fastweb's
partnerships with other companies,
bodies and institutional players with
