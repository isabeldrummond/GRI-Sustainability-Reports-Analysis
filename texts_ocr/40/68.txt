Together, talent and innovation are interlinked
drivers of development, and this is why we
focus intensely on promoting professional
development through many initiatives for
students and young job-seekers.

In recent years, the company has taken a number of
different steps to publicize Fastweb on the job market,
investing in communications, meetings and orientation
sessions for students and young job-seekers.

First and foremost, it created a special section on
its website titled “Working at Fastweb", which gives
people an idea of what it means to work at Fastweb
and describes the company's values and employee
initiatives, such as smart working and the welfare
program.

This area also leads to the “Work with us" section,
which links directly to the Fastweb Digital Recruiting
platform where people may apply for job openings,
upload their CV and try out the Web Assessment,

a series of online tests for the applicant's initial
assessment.

The tests include Digital 1Q (see details in Chapter 3)
and help Fastweb find out more about the applicants,
evaluate them and provide personal guidance. Each
applicant receives feedback in real time, regardless of
the results of the process, and this helps them best
focus on their improvement areas.

Social networks have also played a key role in promoting
the company, along with Fastweb's partnership with a
few of Italy's leading recruitment sites.

In addition, the company consolidated its relationship
with universities through 17 events in various Italian

cities (Milan, Rome, Bari, Turin, Naples, Catania, Cagliari,

Cosenza, Albano Laziale and Poggio Mirteto). These
17 events included 12 multi-company Career Days and
five university events dedicated exclusively to Fastweb,
such as the Recruiting Days held at the Polytechnic
University of Bari and the Roma Tre University, in
which Fastweb employees told students about their
educational background and professional experience.

The webinars about “ways of working at Fastweb” have

been another way for potential job applicants to learn
about the company. In these webinars, employees

talk about the projects and activities they have been
involved in personally concerning key issues for
Fastweb. Examples are the FASTGate modem, open
innovation, convergence and 5G and cyber security.
The webinar videos are posted and publicized on the
specialized website “Brain at Work" and the company's
social network accounts.

n 2018, the Bicocca University began offering a Data
Science master's program in which Fastweb offers its
data sets, after they have been adequately reprocessed
and made anonymous, for students to use as the

basis for their work. The program also includes an
“exchange”: Fastweb managers are invited to speak in
university classrooms, sharing their experience, and
employees can take participate in the training provided
by university professors. Furthermore, beginning

in December 2018, Bicocca University and Turin
Polytechnic University students have the opportunity to
work on their thesis directly at the company.

n 2018, specific emphasis was given to welcoming
newly hired employees at the company. A new
induction program was kicked off to teach new
employees about the company and its culture, to

help them familiarize themselves with Fastweb's
organization. The program is available to all new
employees and lasts for six months, regardless of their
level, position and type of contract. In addition to the
Welcome Day and the welcome kit on the Intranet,
which were rolled out in 2017, Fastweb has provided for
additional initiatives, such as the assignment of tutors,
customer care mentorships, mentorships at flagship
stores, intermediate interviews with the relevant
business partner HR departments and the preparation
of a dedicated training package.

 

 

For Fastweb, being a sought-after employer means
increasing new generations’ understanding of the
professional world. In particular, through student work
experience programs, the first project having been
initiated with Assolombarda in 2016, Fastweb aims

to introduce students in their third and fourth years of
high school to the world of work. In 2018, the initiative
saw the start of 60 two-week work experiences in the
Milan, Rome and Bari offices. During their stay, the high
school students could also tour the company offices
and the data centers, to gain a better understanding of
Fastweb's business.

 

In 2018, a specific web page for the orientation and
student work experience was created on the corporate
website, explaining the main projects for schools and
students. With the same objective, during the year,
