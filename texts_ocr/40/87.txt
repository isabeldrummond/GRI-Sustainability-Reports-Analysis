To reduce consumption due to mobility, a source of

consumption on which the company can reduce significantly,
it has implemented a sustainable mobility policy promoting
less travel and privileging the use of video-conferences.

In 2018, Fastweb continued to invest in a series
of projects to reduce energy consumption.

Fastweb's initiatives during the year included the
completion of the energy rehaul at one of its main data
centers by replacing air conditioners and/or retrofitting
systems. With an investment of approximately €1
million, the rehaul was completed in March 2018 and
led to energy savings of around 4 million kWh at 31
December 2018.

The company has continued rolling out the free-cooling
introduction plan commenced in 2017: free cooling is a

The year-on-year increase of roughly 35% in direct
energy consumption in 2018 was mainly due to the
spike in diesel consumption (61%) and, to a lesser
extent, to the increase in petrol consumption (8%).

high-tech solution that cools equipment rooms using
air at room temperature instead of refrigerators when
the outside air temperature permits it. In particular,
feasibility studies on two equipment sites were
completed in 2018, and are expected to lead to energy
savings of 220,000 kWh/year.

In accordance with the guidelines established in
2017, high-energy efficiency solutions are used in the
construction and/or renovation of equipment rooms.
In 2018, these solutions were used for the expansion
of five equipment rooms and in the construction of a
new site.

Thanks to its energy efficiency projects, again in 2018,
Fastweb reported 540 energy efficiency certificates.
