Sustainability at Fastweb.
For a present connected

to the future

2.1 OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

To Fastweb, corporate social responsibility (CSR) means
continuously listening to and promoting dialogue with
stakeholders, the ability to analyze, manage and mitigate the
impacts of company activities and developing innovative
projects for residents, households and companies to
make digitalization a driver for social development in Italy.

CSR means transversally focusing on the impacts that
technologies have on people's lives:

Our company transforms the needs of the social
context in which we operate into initiatives for the
future, starting with four strategic areas defined

as the “pillars of sustainability at Fastweb":
Digitalization and digital skills, Transparency and

Every year and in each area, Fastweb takes tangible
action which can be reformulated according to the
changing context, which is always aimed at achieving
the high-level objectives defined for each pillar.

Integrating sustainability in the business model has led to
the company's progressive structuring with the influence
of the CSR unit, which oversees corporate responsibility
since 2017, reporting directly to the Marketing & Customer
Experience Officer. The professionals on the CSR team
aim to define the overall sustainability strategy in line with
the business strategy, design innovative projects and
implement them in partnership with the other company
units involved and make the most of the work conducted
inside and outside the organization through targeted
communications plans.

In 2018 the CSR unit continued to strengthen its
commitment to these issues, focusing in particular on
three fundamental areas: the development of digital
skills (through the #Getdigital project introduced in
chapter 3), the definition of a sustainability brand for
Fastweb products and services (described in chapter
6) and the spread of a new sustainability culture both
within the company and throughout the country,
based on the conviction that only by promoting
greater awareness at all levels can we achieve real
improvement.

To this end, in addition to a widespread social media
campaign promoting Fastweb's CSR activities, CSR
Open Meetings have been held, open to all employees.
During these informal events, participants have learned
about the company’s sustainability strategies and
initiatives.

During the year, Fastweb continued to reflect on its
strategies and prospects with respect to the key

issues on which to focus its sustainability actions

and reporting, as it aims to deepen the connection
between the company's work, the creation of value
throughout Italy and the main challenges of sustainable
development at national level.

In addition to ongoing updates to the analysis of
interconnections between Fastweb's activities and

the Sustainable Development Goals, the sustainability
milestones reached include having completed a model
to assess Fastweb's direct, indirect and induced
impacts in Italy, the results of which are summarized in
the pages that follow.
