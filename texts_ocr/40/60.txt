In its cyber security efforts, Fastweb works at several
levels to prevent any loss or damage to data and, in the
event of incidents, to limit damage and recover normal
company operations as rapidly as possible.

Through a specific internal division, the company
constantly monitors developments in legislation and
technology to readily adapt and update its business
models. Since 2007, Fastweb is ISO 27001 certified
for information security management, and it has
supplemented this certification with other more
specific certificates in the past few years. Indeed, in
2016, Fastweb obtained ISO 27018 certification for
cloud privacy and, in 2018, it obtained a certificate

of compliance with ISO 27017, which introduces
guidelines for specific information security controls
applicable to cloud service providers, and a certificate
of compliance with ISO 27035, which provides guidance
on information security incident management and
prevention (see chapter 1).

To further strengthen the culture of cyber security
within the company, during the year, Fastweb

also promoted various awareness campaigns for
employees. They included “YOU - the most secure
technology is you" for all employees, launched on
Agora, the company's Intranet. The “YOU" campaign
was publicized using various means, from six videos
in which Fastweb employees appeared as actors and
podcasts written and narrated by an expert, to an
online quiz and a small treasure hunt. In addition to
this campaign, leaflets were published on Agora with
useful tips and guides on how to manage all sensitive
information securely.

Cyber Security Hub was another awareness driver, a
ull day devoted to cyber security and involving around
50 employees, during which cyber security experts
discussed contemporary issues related to online
security. During this event, employees learned about the
undamental steps in the history of the Internet, to gain
an understanding of the reasons for the birth of online
crime and privacy violations. In addition, the human
actor was examined, diversifying the “seven sins”

hat commonly lead someone to become a victim of a
cyberattack.

Fastweb has also rolled out a series of local initiatives
‘0 raise more awareness of the importance of cyber
security at customer and market level. In particular,

in April and May 2018, it held two editions of “Digital
Defense" for customers, dealing with IT security on

he cloud, data backup and personal data protection.
lot only did the meetings inform participants on cyber
security issues, but they also made it possible to gain
eedback from customers on their specific needs,
identifying potential priorities on which to develop

investment strategies.

In addition, Fastweb participated in the first edition of
the Cyber Conference in Rome and Milan organized by
Trend Micro, a global leader in data security and cyber
security solutions for companies. These events involved
a total of 500 people, including telecommunications
operators, consumers and companies. Fastweb
participated in the “System Integration on State" round
table with major Italian cyber security operators to
discuss hot information security issues by proposing
specific solutions.

Fastweb also demonstrated its cyber security
commitment by guiding customers as they
progressively reinforce their defense systems, through
avant-garde solutions and offers tailored to the
different needs of business customers (see paragraph
4.2 of this chapter).

PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION

Personal data protection is of vital importance to the
telecommunications sector and an aspect to which
Fastweb has always devoted its utmost attention. Since
2016, the company has held a certificate of conformity
with ISO 27018 for the protection of personally
identifiable information in public clouds, guaranteeing
compliance with privacy standards in cloud computing
services and constituting the best practices concerning
personal data protection by public cloud providers.

In 2016, Regulation (EU) 2016/679, known as the GDPR,
was approved, updating personal data processing
rules. Among other things, the GDPR specifically
emphasizes the principle of accountability, whereby

the data controller must adopt, and always be able to
demonstrate that it has adopted, appropriate technical or
organizational measures to ensure that the processing is
effectively carried out in accordance with the Regulation.
The protection of personal data must be incorporated

in business processes from the start of their design
(privacy by design) and the data processing must be
minimized by default (privacy by default). The Regulation
also gave data subjects additional rights, such as the
right to data portability and the right to be forgotten.

Between 2017 and 2018, as the date when the
Regulation would take full effect approached, Fastweb
carried out activities for compliance with the new
legislation, planning to update constantly over time,

to ensure that data are always processed correctly

and are protected by adequate security measures.

The GDPR organizational model has updated and/or
defined roles within the company, processes to support
business functions in the design and implementation
of products and services up to the highest protection
