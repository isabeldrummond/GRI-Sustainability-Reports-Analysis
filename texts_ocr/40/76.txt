5.4 FASTWEB'S WELFARE MODEL: ALL-ROUND WELL-BEING

Fastweb's welfare model is designed
to support employees by providing
services and solutions that improve
their lives, extensive insurance and
healthcare coverage, initiatives and
partnership agreements for education, sport, culture
and leisure.

In particular, the company's welfare services cover
eight essential areas:

1. Work-life balance which, in addition to smart
working described above, provides for specific
services to lighten workers’ daily load, such as an
online assistance to handle small, daily errands;

2. Benefits, including the extension of employees’
opportunity to request early pay-out of post-
employment benefits, the chance to use flexible
benefits, free tax assistance in the office, company
discounts and partnership agreements for products
at reduced prices;

3. Insurance, consisting, in particular, of life
insurance, permanent invalidity and professional/
non-professional liability insurance for the entire
company population, in addition to health insurance
policies at reduced premiums;

 

4. Healthcare, including various health programs for
employees, free flu vaccines, cancer awareness
campaigns (in partnership with LILT) blood
donor awareness campaigns and well-organized,
affordable insurance for medical expenses;

5. Education, consisting of summer and winter camps
for employees' children, school books at discounted
prices with deferred payment in pay slips and
contests/initiatives for employees’ children;

6. Sport, with a variety of free initiatives for runners and
tickets to sports events;

7. Culture and leisure, including free cultural activities
at the company or exhibition and museum tickets
and tours;

8. Mobility, with discounts and deferred payment plans
for public transport passes and car sharing benefits.

To increasingly expand the range of services and
benefits available to employees, in early 2018, the
Fastweb completely rehauled the “Fast for me"
company welfare platform, transforming it into a
web-based platform accessible from any device and

providing a broader spectrum of increasingly varied,
nationwide offers.

The portal was divided into three sections, each of
which consists of specific offers and services for saving
time and money: “For you", with benefits for workers,
“For your children", with solutions for children and
teenagers; and “For your family", the section consisting
of offers specifically designed for relatives and family
members.

Flexible benefits are another important initiative
unveiled in 2018: an alternative performance bonuses
not subject to income or social security taxes,
consisting of goods, services and non-monetary
benefits in addition to the monetary portion of their
performance bonuses (PDR). In particular, Fastweb
now offers employees the chance to convert all or

a portion of their annual performance bonus into
goods and services through “Fast for me", in the areas
provided for by the new regulations. This initiative

has already been extremely popular in its first year:
amongst the employees who receive the PDR (51,5%
of total workforce), 10% opted for this remuneration
model, converting to flexible benefits 75% (average) of
total PDR bonuses; in addition, the company increased
the portion of alternative performance bonuses that
employees converted into flexible benefits by 20%.

 

Another 2018 initiative involved mobile telephony deals:
all employees were offered the chance to use up to

two SIM cards for free within the limits of the plan, and
the cost of mobile telephony services was halved for
employees who used the same mobile phone for both
work and personal use.

Personal well-being at Fastweb does not end with the
benefits and special discounts, but can also be found
in its focus on personal interests and the activities and
initiatives it offers.

It has continued to organize Run Happy Crew, a sports
initiative designed to boost people's energy, motivation
and excitement. Around 320 runners participated

in 2018, meeting weekly to train after work with
professional trainers provided by Fastweb at no charge.
The running crew had the opportunity to participate in
races and running events in various cities during the
year, with the company paying their registration fees.

In the field of art, Fastweb launched “In Connection
with Art", opening its doors to contemporary art quite
literally, as exhibitions were held at the Fastweb offices
in Milan, Rome and Bari. This initiative also included
meetings with the artists and interactive experiences
