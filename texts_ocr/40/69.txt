Fastweb also signed a protocol of understanding with
ANPAL, the national agency for active labor policies,
to forge a closer link between school and the private
sector.

Demonstrating its commitment to projects for the
2017/18 academic year, in July 2018, the company
received the BAQ, a mark of quality work experience
for high school students awarded, which Confindustria
awards to companies that stand apart for offering high
quality work experience.

Lastly, another two projects topped off Fastweb's
efforts in work experience for high school students: the
new Digital Work Experience developed in partnership
with Cariplo Factory, which gave 100 high school
students the chance to participate in the orientation
and learn about the Fastweb universe (see par. 3.2), and
Push to Open Junior, an orientation program for middle
school students, with support for their parents.

THE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The performance assessment system is the launch
pad for the development of people's competencies and
the creation of targeted development plans for each of
them. Each year, the assessment covers all employees
with open-ended contracts (including apprentices) who
have been with the company for at least six months.

The assessment model is based on three performance
areas: professional competencies, the soft skills that
characterize life at the company (Be Customer, Be
Simple, Be Decision-Maker, Be Positive, Be Fastweb)
and managerial competencies (Develop People, Lead
Performance, Be inclusive with everyone) for employees
with management responsibilities. Employees may
gather feedback not only from their supervisor and
predecessor (if they have held their position for fewer
than six months) but from the colleagues working
closely with them as well.

Following the performance review, the most appropriate
development and training begin to make the most of
each employee's competencies, as described in the
“Employee training and development” section.

THE REWARDS SYSTEM

The criteria used to assign rewards began undergoing
a major assessment and revision process in 2018: the
first step was an overall survey of the current system,
while mapping the roles of a benchmark system for

the telecommunications market. With the involvement
of a few company managers, positions were analyzed
by family, sub-family and role, and there classified in

bands based on their level of accountability. Each band
was assigned a salary range based on the market
benchmark.

The mapping will be provided to the company
population so all employees are more aware of their
role and position within the organization and have a
solid framework for the definition of their career and
development at Fastweb.

Moreover, sharing this analysis is another step towards
transparency and guaranteeing the application of
merit-based parameters when personnel remuneration
and management policies are defined.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

To retain a set of competencies that is always up

to technological and market trends, in recent years
Fastweb has based its employee development and
training activities on the 70-20-10 Model, characterized
by the involvement and accountability of people. With
this model, only 10% of the activities offered rely on
formal teaching, while on-the-job experience accounts
for 70% and contact with colleagues, i.e., the social
effect, accounts for 20%.

In 2018, the development drivers remained coaching,
mentoring and the “Tour of Duty”.

In particular, during the year, coaching labs continued.
They are structured group development activities in
which participants discuss and share their experiences.
Some employees have been offered individual
coaching, which consists of six months with an in-
house or external coach to ramp up managerial skills
based on a development objective.

On the other hand, mentoring is an eight- to nine-
month-long program that provides for periodic
meetings between mentor (in-house) and mentees:
in 2018, this program was expanded and involved 62
resources.

The Tour of Duty program started as a pilot project in
2017 and continued in 2018: it enables participants to
work in other company divisions than their own. The
program is an agreement between the company and
the employee, in which the employee works for three
months to one year in a different company division,
thereby developing new competencies and abilities.

In 2018, Fastweb invested significantly in development
and managerial training with classroom activities
focused on developing personal responsibility and

the ability to delegate and provide effective and
