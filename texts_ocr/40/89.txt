recorded in 2018 would have been 85,082°” tCO2
equivalents, i.e., this is the amount of emissions that
Fastweb prevents each year thanks to its renewable
source procurement policy.

Other indirect emissions (Scope 3), by origin

Lastly, other indirect emissions (Scope 3) increased
from 172 to 241 kt of CO, equivalents (+40%), due to the
relative increase of approximately 53% resulting from
the acquisition of optical fiber.

By calculating the intensity of its emissions, Fastweb
measures its efficiency in terms of climate changing
emissions as the ratio of total emissions (expressed in
kg of CO, equivalents) and the traffic volumes recorded
on its network (expressed in TBytes). This ratio
amounts to 68 in 2018, up by 12% on 2017, in line with
the increase in CO, emissions, which was only partially
offset by the rise in data traffic volumes.

2017 was the first year in which Fastweb calculated
Enabling Effects (Scope 4) which reflect the emissions
avoided by customers by using Fastweb's services.

The model was developed in accordance with the
Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) “Evaluating
the carbon-reducing impacts of ICT" guidelines

and Swisscom’s framework and considers video-
conferencing, housing and hosting services, as well
work-from-home and services enabling customers to
avoid printing documents and using online services.

Thanks to these activities and based on the
calculation model used, Fastweb estimates that it
has helped its customers avoid climate changing
emissions totaling 194,954 tCO, equivalents in 2018,
up 5% on 2017.

The analysis of Enabling Effects has made it possible
to evaluate the net impact in terms of climate change
by calculating the ratio of avoided emissions to those
emissions produced by Fastweb's activities, which in
2018 is 0.79.

This highlights how the benefits in terms of mitigating
climate change impacts resulting from Fastweb's
services significantly help offset the impacts of its
activities.
