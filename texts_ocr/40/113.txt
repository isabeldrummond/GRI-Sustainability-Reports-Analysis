GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network)

FTTH network architecture in which fiber optics arrives
inside the customer's home. It allows for extremely high
performance, superior to 1 Gbit/s. The GPON network
uses passive “splitters” to subdivide the fiber repeatedly
and to direct it towards various buildings, thus reducing
the amount of fiber and necessary apparatus with
respect to other FTTH architecture used in the past.
The passive nature of the GPON network allows for the
elimination of “active” network elements in the access
network (which are therefore limited to the base and in
the customers’ homes), reducing the use of electricity
and increasing efficiency for an energy standpoint.

ICT (Information and Communication(s) Technology)
Set of methods and technologies used for
manufacturing the transmission, reception and
processing of information and data.

IP (Internet Protocol)

Set of communication standards used to exchange
data on the Internet. This network interconnection
protocol (Inter-Networking Protocol) is classified

at network layer (3) of ISO/OSI model, created to
interconnect heterogeneous networks for technology,
performance, management, therefore implemented
above other connection protocols, like Ethernet or
ATM. It is a connectionless and best-effort delivery
service and therefore does not guarantee reliability of
communication in terms of error control, flow control
and congestion control, which are handled by the higher
transport layer (level 4) transfer protocols, such as TCP.
The currently adopted version of the IP protocol is also
called IPv4 to distinguish it from the more recent IPv6,
developed to deal with the growing number of computers.

Local Loop (Doppino Telefonico)

The pair of twisted copper wires physically connecting
a customer's home or office to the telephone
company's exchange. This is the traditional foundation
of telephone lines and is also referred to as the “last
mile".

Multimedia
A service involving two or more communications

media (e.g. voice, video, text etc.) and hybrid products
generated through their interaction.

Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO)

A mobile telephone services provider that uses the
network infrastructure of another operator to provide
services to its customers. An MVNO is a full-fledged
telephone services provider (with its own SIM cards,
prepaid and/or subscription promotions, customer care
and management) that does not have its own network
infrastructure.

Alternative operator
Alternative telecommunications provider to TIM, the
former incumbent carrier in Italy.

Administrative bodies

In this report, the expression “administrative bodies"
refers to the Management Board and the Board of
Directors.

Platform

The complete set of inputs, including hardware,
software, operating equipment and procedures,

to produce (production platform) or manage
(management platform) a particular service (service
platform).

Network

A set of connected elements. In a telephone network,
these elements consist of switches connected to
one another and to the customer's equipment. The
transmission equipment may consist of fiber optic or
metal cables or of point-to-point radio connections.

User Experience

What a person experiences when using a product,
system or service. User experience refers to the
experiential and emotional aspects and the meaning
and value of owning a product and interacting with it,
in addition to the person's perception of aspects such
as utility, ease of use and efficiency. It is considered
subjective because it relates to an individual's ideas
and feelings about a system, and it is dynamic because
it varies over time with the user's circumstances.
