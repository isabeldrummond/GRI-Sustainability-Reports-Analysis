THE PROJECT

Bari Matera 5G is the project with which Fastweb, TIM and Huawei jointly submitted in 2017 the
winning tender in the call by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development for experimentation
with new 5G technology in these two cities.
In 2018, the consortia formed by the three companies completed certain case studies using this

technology: specifically, Fastweb worked directly on the following innovative applications that,
in addition to demonstrating the technological potential of the 5G network, pave the way for
new business models that will revolutionize these areas, transforming them into genuine digital

 

laboratories.

HEALTHCARE 5.0

Remote diagnosis and monitoring of
patients’ vital signs and conditions
Using a protocol with the Bari
Cancer Institute, a telemedicine
project was developed to

provide home assistance to
onco-hematology patients post-
chemotherapy. The system is
based on the hospital network
model and provides for the supply
of devices for the measurement

of vital signs at the patient's home
and the use of a mobile laboratory
connected to the 5G network for lab
work requiring medical personnel.

In this way, the hospital network
makes it possible to send doctors
key information on the health of their
patients so they can adjust their
treatment without having to leave
home. In addition, patients receive
asmart medicine cabinet with
indicators that alert patients with
alarms and text messages, when they
need to take the various medicines.

This solution improves patients’
quality of life by shortening hospital
stays, increasing the efficiency and
timeliness of care and decreasing
the cost of hospital stays.

     

In another telemedicine project in
partnership with the Bari Cancer
Institute, the consortium is
working on a digital asset tracking
service for hospital assets

(like machines and buildings)
and medicine bags used for
chemotherapy. With respect to
the latter, the various medicine
bags are digitally tracked and
associated with the respective
patients via smartphone, with the
dual aim of minimizing the risk
of human error in the distribution
of drugs and making the entire
process more efficient.
