Solidarity with earthquake victims
in Central Italy

Again in 2018, Fastweb was on the front line
supporting people in Central Italy affected by the
earthquake, continuing to help the Civil Protection
Service, residents and resident customers in the
areas hit by the tremors. A community center was
opened in Accumoli in October, built using funds
raised by Fastweb employees.

Around-the-clock pediatric call center

In collaboration with its customers, Fastweb
supports the Around-the-Clock Pediatric Call Centre
Project created by LILT (the Italian League for the
Fight against Cancer). Fastweb matches every euro
donated by customers in their contracts, doubling the
value of the donation.

The project began in 2016 to provide real help

to families facing difficulties following hospital
treatment with remote assistance offered by the
Cancer Pediatric Department of the National Cancer
Institute in Milan, ensuring a call center that is open
24 hours a day.

Volunteering at the Gorlini shelter

175 Fastweb employees spent three different days
at the SPRAR migrant shelter in via Gorlini, which the
Milan municipal authorities indicated as in urgent
need of assistance, working as volunteers. During
this experience, employees helped trim hedges, clean
the courtyards, carry out maintenance and repairs,
paint the interiors and prepare meals that they then
shared with the shelter guests. In addition, the more
creative volunteers painted a mural on an exterior

wall provided by the municipal authorities. In addition,

a few employees shared their digital expertise,
teaching guests basic IT skills and helping them
prepare, at the end of the three Team Building days,
CVs to use as they search for work.

and initiatives, and even involving its employees and
customers.

Digital Solidarity, a digital contest to
promote solidarity

In partnership with Fondazione Ente dello Spettacolo
and Corriere della Sera Buone Notizie, Fastweb held
“Digitali e Solidali - L'Italia delle buone notizie" - Digital
Solidarity - Goods News in Italy, a contest to promote
Italy's leading role in solidarity initiatives. Its aim was to
encourage residents to collectively describe their positive
experiences in this field and to highlight the successful
solidarity projects often ignored by the media and,
accordingly, unknown to the public. Participants were
asked to create a short film documenting a solidarity
project that uses digital technology and communication
networks, to multiply the impacts and make the
charitable initiative more efficient and innovative. The
top 10 short films, which were selected by a panel of
judges, including the President, two representatives

of the film magazine “Rivista del Cinematografo" and
Cinematografo.it, one representative of "“Corriere della
Sera Buone Notizie" and one representative of Fastweb,
were presented and shown during the 75th annual
nternational Venice Film Festival.

 

Tangible support for the city of Genoa

nthe wake of the collapse of the Morandi Bridge,
Fastweb lent support to customers in Genoa who

had to evacuate their homes. For example, Fastweb
gave its active mobile customers prepaid top-ups
and took measures to suspend landline connection
services without requiring them to carry out contractual
‘ormalities and without applying deactivation costs.
Fastweb has also kicked off a campaign to contact all
resident customers in the areas affected by the collapse
of the bridge to inform them of the new measures.

 

Solidarity telephone numbers

With specific telephone numbers, Fastweb has
supported initiatives in 2018 covering a wide

range of different social and humanitarian causes,
including scientific research, childhood, supporting
developing countries, violence against women, socially
disadvantaged groups, nature and the environment
and emergencies. In 2018, Fastweb customers helped
donate a total of €495,516 to 112 associations.
