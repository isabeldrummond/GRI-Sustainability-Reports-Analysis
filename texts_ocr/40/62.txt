residual charge, imposing a base fine of €150,000,
which it increased four-fold to €600,000 as it believed
that, otherwise, Fastweb's financial conditions would
have made the fine pointless. Although it did not agree
with certain aspects of the charges, Fastweb preferred
to pay the fine without taking additional action, partly
because they related to events that occurred before
the GDPR was implemented and to regulations that
were no longer applicable in certain aspects.

With respect to relationships with the data subjects,
Fastweb provides a series of different ways for data
subjects to file complaints relating to the processing
of personal data, so that it may respond promptly
and transparently, including an email address
(privacy@fastweb.it) and a certified email address
(privacy@pec.fastweb.it).

In 2018, it received eight reports from the Personal

62 Trusted and lean customer partner

Data Protection Authority, and Fastweb immediately
responded to each of these. During the year, it received
1,352 requests from individuals in emails sent to its
dedicated email address; roughly 53% of the requests
were to object to the data processing, while 38% related
to the publication of the customer's telephone number
in the directory, 5% to request cancellation and the
remaining 4% were for other reasons. In 2018 two
cases of data losses or thefts occurred.

The company continued assessments with its suppliers
previously conducted in 2017, in order to verify

that their customer data are properly managed and
protected. In particular, in 2018, 12 assessments were
conducted at Fastweb's outbound sales units.
