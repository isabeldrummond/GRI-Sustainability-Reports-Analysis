We strove for continuity in the face of these changes

in 2018, including in the area of “Trusted and lean
customer partner". For our customers, we confirmed

our commitment to quality, listening and transparency,
which we believe are crucial to our company’s long-
term competitiveness. Through five new chapters in the
#Nientecomeprima strategy, like nothing before, we have
radically improved our offer and services, making them
increasingly simpler and clearer for users. The market
continues to reward us for this approach, which we plan
to uphold and strengthen in the years to come, completely
revolutionizing the ways in which we interact with our
customers, based on trust and service quality.

At Fastweb, we are aware that this transformation has
been possible solely through our people's talent and
ability to innovate, and this is why we continued to

make our company's innovation a way of life again this
year. “Working smart" is a new way of working, based

on individual responsibility, valuing talent, involving
people in the life of the company, flexibility and including
diversity, to co-design our company’s future together with
our employees, as we have done this year for the new,
futuristic offices in Milan.

One last project of which we are particularly proud relates
to environmental protection. For years we have monitored
our impact in terms of climate change in order to
progressively reduce our carbon footprint. With the launch
of our new “Fastweb for Sustainability” brand, we will
offer customers the chance to purchase our products and
services based on their environmental benefits (reduction
of COz emissions), thereby helping people understand the

importance of individual efforts to achieve the objectives of
sustainable development.

The steps taken this year in these areas demonstrate

how Fastweb is a company that creates value not only

for its shareholders and employees, but for the country

as a whole. This year, have decided to measure this value
by assessing the direct, indirect and induced impacts

of our organization. We are talking about over 2 billion
euro in procurement and investments in 2018, which
generated more than 34 thousands direct and indirect
jobs, contributing 3 billion euro to GDP and 544,2 million
euro in taxes paid. These are significant figures that
underscore the importance of our company and our sector
as drivers for national growth and employment. We are
proud of these figures, which mark the boundaries of our
responsibility and our commitment today and tomorrow
for sustainable development, a field in which we intend to
remain one step ahead, making the most of the potential of
new technologies.
