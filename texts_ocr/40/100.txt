THE CALCULATION METHODOLOGY
The methodology used to calculate certain indicators
reported in this Sustainability Report is described below.

Personnel indicators

All personnel indicators, with the exception of 102-8
and 403-2, which consider the total workforce and
herefore include trainees and temporary workers, refer
‘o employees with permanent contracts, employees
with fixed-term contracts and apprentices in service at
he end of the reporting year.

Turnover

ew employee turnover is calculated as the number

of new hires during the year compared to the number
of company employees (employees with permanent,
ixed-term and apprenticeship contracts) at 31
December of the same year.

Outgoing employee turnover is calculated as the number of
employees who left the company during the year compared
‘o the number of company employees (employees with
permanent, fixed-term and apprenticeship contracts) at
31 December of the same year.

 

The total employee turnover rate is calculated as the
number of new hires and employees who left the
company during the year compared to the number of
company employees in service on 31 December of the
same year (considering employees with permanent,
fixed-term and apprenticeship contracts).

Post-parental leave retention rate

The retention rate of employees who have returned from
parent leave is calculated as the number of employees
(with permanent, fixed-term and apprenticeship
contracts) still in service 12 months after they have
returned from parental leave, compared to the total
number of employees who took parental leave.

Injury rates

The injury rates are calculated as follows:

= Fatality rate: number of fatal injuries/workable
hours*1,000,000

= Serious injury rate: number of injuries resulting in
more than 40 days of missed work (excluding fatal
injuries) / hours worked*1,000,000

= Recordable injury rate: number of injuries that
occurred in the year (including illnesses) / hours
worked 1,000,000

100 Additional information

The calculation of these rates includes employees with
permanent, fixed-term and apprenticeship contracts,
and excludes interns and temporary workers. The first
day considered is the date when the injury occurs.
Recorded injuries are those with a prognosis of at least
three days.

Hours worked in 2016 and 2017 were calculated by
subtracting lost hours due to absence in the year from
total workable hours in the same year.

Energy consumption

Energy consumption volumes have been converted into
GJ considering the primary source of energy and using
the GRI 3.1 conversion factors. Specifically, MWh =
3.6 GJ; 1000 Nmc of natural gas = 39.01 GJ; 1 kg of
petrol = 44.80 MJ; 1 kg of diesel = 43.33 MJ. Petrol
and diesel were converted from liters to kg considering
the conversion factors specified in the Stationary
Combustion Tool of the GHG Protocol — version 4.0,
specifically: 1 | petrol = 0.74 kg petrol; 1 | diesel = 0.84
kg diesel (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-
tools/all-tools).

Residential and business customers' electricity
consumption was estimated (GRI 302-2 Energy
consumption outside of the organization) by multiplying
the capacity data of devices provided to customers by
the number of hours those devices are used in a year.
The capacity of devices without specified capacity
data was estimated using the CLEER model (http://
cleermodel.lbl.gov/) or based on the data given in the
products’ technical specifications. The average hours
of use were estimated according to in-house analyses.

Greenhouse gas emissions

Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated on

the basis of internationally recognized guidelines,
specifically the "Corporate Accounting and Reporting
Standard" of the Global Greenhouse Gas Protocol (the
accepted standard for monitoring climate-changing
emissions) and the "ICT Footprint - Pilot Testing on
Methodologies for Energy Consumption and Carbon
Footprint of the ICT-sector" developed by the European
Commission.

Location-based Scope 2 emissions were calculated
considering the factors in the international Ecoinvent
database.
