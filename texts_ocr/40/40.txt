= Protecting Vesuvius

A video-surveillance system has been set up at
the National Mount Vesuvius Park, reusing certain
pre-existing video cameras partly integrated with
new infrastructures and video cameras installed
for environmental control, as well as license plate
reading and infra-red night vision devices. This new
technological solution, which can monitor 35 sites
linked to three central operating stations, will keep
the area under control and prevent criminal activity
and critical situations.

= Presence Analytics

Designed in partnership with the Turin municipal
authorities, this solution analyses the data
gathered via the public wi-fi infrastructure in the
city of Turin. The data, after having been made
anonymous, range from people counts to the
analysis of mobility of flows, walkability indices
and origin/destination matrices forming a set of
statistics enabling the municipal authorities to
analyze irregular concentrations of people that
could compromise public order and to better plan
public transport in the city."

This testing, the result of a partnership with the
Turin municipal authorities, consists of monitoring
the temperature, humidity, wind direction and
intensity and the concentration of PM10, PM2.5,
CO, NO2, VOC, ozone and SO2 in the air by installing
weather stations in certain areas of the city to
gauge these environmental parameters. It is one
of the first solutions of its kind in Italy and includes
noise sensors to measure the level of noise
pollution. This information will feed an analytics
platform supporting the local authorities’ analyses
and decisions.'4

u FastPark

Created in partnership with the Turin municipal
authorities, this is a smart parking solution in which
sensors and video cameras are installed to monitor
the occupancy of parking spaces in the city. It is
expected to help reduce traffic and emissions and
to optimize the search for a parking space, while
generating big data on mobility. The data generated
will feed an analytics platform supporting the local
authorities’ analyses and decisions, which will in
turn create a real-time view of the occupancy of
car parks and mobility flows in the city.'4
