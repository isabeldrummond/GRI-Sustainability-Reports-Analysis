4.6 THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGIES AND DATA PROTECTION
IN THE DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM

Data protection and cyber security are crucial in
current context of technological innovation and digital
transformation: the centrality of ICT infrastructure
increases daily, along with the need to protect
confidentiality and the integrity of the information and
data shared digitally.

In addition to constant technological development,
there is continuously evolving legislation that Fastweb
undertakes to monitor each year, particularly in fields
that could potentially have an adverse impact on
customers and residents.

The company is especially focused on comprehensively
protecting users' data, from cyber security to privacy,
an area at the heart of the European and domestic
agenda.

CYBER SECURITY

Cyber security and data protection remain the focus of
international attention. With 1,127 serious cyberattacks
worldwide in 2017, mainly against business and
government targets, cybercrime has led to an increase
in information security investments with global
spending of more than $100 billion today. Furthermore,
expenditure for security services is expected to grow
at an annual average rate of 10 to 13% in the next five
years, depending on the sector.”*

In the light of these trends, Europe and Italy have
intensified their focus on cyber security. In 2017, for
example, the European Commission issued “Resilience
Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurit
for the EU", containing a series of proposals to increase
the resilience of information systems to cyber threats.

Malware: Malware (a portmanteau for malicious software) is any
software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer,
server, client, or computer network. Malware has a malicious
intent, these programs can cause your device to crash, and can
be used to monitor and control your online activity. They also can
make your computer vulnerable to viruses and deliver unwanted
or inappropriate ads. Criminals use malware to steal personal
information, send spam, and commit fraud."”°
