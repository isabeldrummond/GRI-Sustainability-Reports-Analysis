FAIR COMPETITION AND TRANSPARENCY
IN PRODUCT INFORMATION

Compliance with antitrust rules and transparency in
customer communications, two cornerstones of the
telecommunications market, are highly regulated and
supervised by various public authorities.

AGCM, the Italian Antitrust Authority

AGCM is the Italian Antitrust Authority responsible
for enforcing compliance with rules that prohibit
anti-competition agreements between companies,
the abuse of dominant market positions and
concentrations that could create or strengthen
dominant positions to the detriment of competition.
The President and members of AGCM are appointed
by the Presidents of the Italian House and Senate.

 

AGCOM, the Italian Communications
Authority

AGCOM is responsible for ensuring fair competition
among telecommunications market players and
reports it work to Parliament, which defines its
powers and by-laws and appoints it members.

Again in 2018, Fastweb confirmed its commitment
to communicating with customers with transparent
messages and clear descriptions of its offers to
strengthen the trust-based relationship that the
company has forged with its customers. Indeed,
this trust is the foundation of a positive experience
for Fastweb service users. However, in 2018, AGCM
assessed certain non-conformities in Fastweb's
commercial communications.

Specifically, in November 2017, AGCM began a
procedure to impose sanctions on Fastweb and all
major domestic telephone operators, challenging

their allegedly misleading use of the term “fiber”

in advertising campaigns to promote connectivity
services via optical fiber and, in particular, in connection
with non-FTTH connection services.

Although Fastweb deemed AGCM's claims to be
unfounded, it proposed a series of commitments that

16 The Fastweb model. Always a step ahead

it could make, which were, however, rejected by AGCM.
Consequently, it paid the amount of the sanction
imposed in the final decision of April 2018, totaling

4.4 million Euros, while lodging an appeal with the
Regional Administrative Court. Indeed, Fastweb
believes that AGCM began the sanction procedure

at a time when AGCOM (the Italian Communications
Authority) was still defining the related regulations.

As soon as AGCOM defined the new regulations on the
use of the term “fiber” in communications targeting
users in July 2018, Fastweb updated its advertising
messages and changed all communications relating
to non-FTTH fiber connection services, replacing the
word “fiber” with “super fast Internet". From that time
on, Fastweb has only used the term “ultra-fiber” for
connections that it provides completely via optical
fiber to the user's door. Furthermore, it has added the
required green symbol solely for cases in which the
advertising messages are for specific regions covered
with FTTH/GPON technologies.

 

During the year, Fastweb received another two
notifications of AGCOM sanction procedures. In March
2018 AGCOM fined the company 170 thousand Euros
for alleged disservices to users during access service
migration and termination procedures. In July 2018
AGCOM fined the company 406 thousand Euros,
claiming that Fastweb had continued to advertise
offers with renewal and billing every four weeks even
after Italian Law 172/2017 entered into force, requiring
operators to provide renewal and billing on a monthly
basis or in month-based multiples. In both cases,
after paying the sanction, Fastweb appealed before
the Regional Administrative Court. In particular, the
company appealed against the second sanction as

it referred to the same matter with the same claims
already made by AGCOM to justify the previous
sanction in December 2017 concerning billing every
four weeks. With respect to these sanctions, after all
major operators filed appeals, the Council of State
suspended AGCOM's order to refund users until the
reasons for the first-level decision cancelling the
December 2017 sanction for 1.16 million Euros were
made known. In this context, Fastweb was the only
operator to have already offered compensation to its
customers (activation and use of the WOW Space
service for free and forever), which it confirmed even
after receiving the Council of State's decision.
