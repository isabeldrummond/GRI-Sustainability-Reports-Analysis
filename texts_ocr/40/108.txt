The occupational health and safety
management system documentation is
available on the company intranet for
all employees and executives within the

company; communications regarding heath

and safety issues are encouraged and are
enabled by a specific tool on the company

intranet. Employees representatives for health
and safety (RLS) are periodically engaged to

discuss on health and safety issues.

Information about work-related risks (e.g.,
hazardous substances) are not reported, as
they do not apply to Fastweb or are already
implicit in the company's ISO and OHSAS
certification.

The management of career endings has

not been considered a material topic for

Fastweb and, therefore, is not included in
specific company plans.

The quantitative information
required for the indicator is
not available for suppliers.
The company manages this
topic through structured
procedures and controls in the
management of suppliers, and
believes that data on these
indicators cannot be collected
in the short and medium term.
