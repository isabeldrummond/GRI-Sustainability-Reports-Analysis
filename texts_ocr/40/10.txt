THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Fastweb is governed by a Board of Directors (BoD) with
a three-year term and whose members may be re-
appointed. The BoD is vested with the fullest powers for
both the ordinary and extraordinary management of the
company and has the right to do whatever is necessary
to achieve the corporate purpose.

Fastweb's current Board of Directors was appointed by
the shareholder during the shareholder's meeting on
17 March 2016 and its term of office will end with the
meeting called to approve the financial statements at
31 December 2018. As determined by the shareholder,
the BoD consists of six directors selected by the
company's sole shareholder. On 28 February 2018, the
shareholder appointed Peter Burkhalter as director to
replace Ulrich Dietiker, who had resigned.

The procedure for the appointment of the Board of
Directors requires that the shareholder appoint the
directors during the shareholder's meeting upon the sole
shareholder's proposal. Their term of office ends on the
date of the shareholder's meeting called to approve the
financial statements for the last year of their term.

Although it is no longer legally required to have an
independent director, the company decided to retain
Professor Alberto Giussani as Independent Director on
the Board of Directors, as he served previously when
the company was listed on the Italian stock exchange.

The Board of Directors must be promptly notified

of any conflicts of interest involving directors. The
director concerned must specify “the nature, terms,
origin and extent” of his/her interest, providing any
relevant information to allow the other directors and
he statutory auditors to evaluate whether there is a
conflict, and, in general, whether the transaction is
inancially advantageous for the company.

The Board of Directors may ask the Supervisory Body
0 conduct an immediate or routine check of the
aspects subject to the conflict of interest.

The Board of Directors meets at least once each
quarter, as needed, and is vested with the fullest
powers, except for those reserved for the shareholder's
meeting by law. At the first BoD meeting of the year,

he Board of Directors approves the budget for that
year and the draft financial statements. The Board of
Directors held 18 meetings in 2018.

 

The BoD's remuneration policies are decided jointly
with the shareholder. However, the Board of Directors
retains responsibility for fees for special duties and the
Management Board's remuneration.

THE INDEPENDENT CONTROL COMMITTEE

After the company's delisting, the Board of Directors
established the Independent Control Committee on 27
April 2011, assigning it internal control duties and a
structure and functions that are more simplified than
those required of listed companies with respect to, inter
alia, the accounting policies for the preparation of the
financial statements, auditing and risk identification.

The Committee's additional duties include the
definition of the guidelines for the internal control
system for Fastweb and its subsidiaries and the
annual assessment of the internal control system. To
further guarantee the Committee's independence, the
Independent Chairman Alberto Giussani has a standing
invitation to attend its meetings, along with: the external
member of the Supervisory Body set up by Fastweb
pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001, the
members of Fastweb's Board of Statutory Auditors,
Fastweb's Chief Audit Executive, Fastweb's Senior
Manager of Compliance & Risk Management and its
Risk Manager: Any other person that the Committee
deems appropriate in relation to the matter to be
discussed may also participate in the Committee's
meetings.

The Board of Directors appointed the current
Independent Control Committee on 17 March 2016
and its term of office will end with the shareholder's
meeting called to approve the financial statements at
31 December 2018.

THE BOARD OF STATUTORY AUDITORS

The current Board of Statutory Auditors monitors
compliance with the law, the by-laws and the principles
of proper administration. It also verifies that the
organizational, administrative and accounting structure
is adequate and functional and that the independent
auditors are indeed independent. The shareholder
appointed the current Board of Statutory Auditors on

2 March 2017 and its term of office will end with the
shareholder's meeting called to approve the financial
statements at 31 December 2019.

THE GENERAL MANAGER

The Board of Directors can appoint one or more
general managers, establishing their powers, including
representation, and their remuneration. On 8 November
2010, Fastweb's Board of Directors appointed Alberto
Calcagno as General Manager, vesting him with full
powers to manage the company, and he remains in
office. The General Manager reports to the Board of
Directors and is responsible for all the company's
divisions and departments.
