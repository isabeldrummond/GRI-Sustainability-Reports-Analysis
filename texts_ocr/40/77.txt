with VR headsets and art docents, in which employees
could interact with the works of art. Furthermore,
employees were offered free tours at top cultural
centers (for the Naples and Turin offices in addition to
the Milan, Rome and Bari offices).

This project, which also included a few initiatives for
customers, received special mention at the European
Parliament's Corporate Art Award 2018 “for having used
art as a tool to promote the creation of a cooperative
environment between employees, customers and
institutions”.

Partnership agreements for employee transport
continued, and again in 2018, Fastweb employees
received discounts on LPT (local public transport)
passes, with deferred payment in their pay slips, as well
as discounts on car sharing in large cities.

In connection with post-employment benefit reform
and in accordance with the national labor agreement,
employees pay their monthly contributions into the
government's treasury fund managed by INPS (the

Italian social security institute), or they may opt to
transfer all or some of their contributions to a specific
pension fund for workers in the telecommunications
sector (Telemaco). As required by pension fund
legislation, if an employee (white collar or junior
manager) opts to pay into the Telemaco fund and pays,
in addition to post-employment benefits, additional
contributions (minimum of 1%), the company must
in turn pay a fixed contribution of 1.20% of the
remuneration considered in the calculation of post-
employment benefits. However, executives may
currently choose one of two pension funds (Insieme
or Previndai, up to 2007 only Previras was offered to
executives) and the minimum contribution is 4%, to
which the company must add a fixed contribution of
4% of the remuneration considered in the calculation
of post-employment benefits. Employees with open-
ended employment contracts and apprenticeship
contracts may register with pension funds. In 2018,
40.5% of the company's white collar workers and
junior managers (1,001 people) were registered with
Telemaco and 83% of executives (72 people) were
registered with specific supplementary funds.
