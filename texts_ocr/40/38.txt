SMART PORT

Security and access control at the
Bari port

At the Bari port, in collaboration with
Leonardo and Bosch and with the
support of the Southern Adriatic
Sea Port Authority and the bodies
responsible for port security (the
harbor master, Tax Police and State
Police), the consortium is developing
a security and control monitoring
system. There are two objectives:
on one hand, offering the port police
a face recognition tool to help them

reality to train technicians and
facilitate machinery maintenance. A
specific application connected to a
Smart Helmet - a helmet equipped
with virtual viewers - via the 5G
network, guides expert operators

in real time during all maintenance
and training on the engine, making
it more rapid and effective.

In addition, using the 5G network,
technicians may go online to make
video calls using Skype and consult
with their colleagues and experts
video remotely. Furthermore, the
company's customers may use the
same device to carry out simpler
engine maintenance on their own.

Other projects have begun in
the same field and will, through

identify potential suspects, while, on
the other, providing the harbor master
with an alternative to counting
passengers on water vessels, which
is currently done manually and is,
therefore, at risk of error.

Both services are based on an open
system of sensors, video cameras,
wearable devices, terminals, drones
and movable gates that involve, via
the 5G network, information on a
centralized command and control
platform to count the number of

synergies, develop additional smart
industry applications, such as:

g Asset Tracking for monitoring via
using sensors to detect the real-
time location of company assets
and machinery and to improve
logistics within the facilities;

um Smart Maintenance, using a
wireless network of sensors
to monitor devices in the
production facilities for predictive
maintenance;

mu Smart Safety, i.e., the use of
systems to verify that individual
protective devices have
been properly distributed in
accordance with occupational
safety legislation.

people or recognize their faces. The
system also makes it possible to
manage security procedures and to
alert the police or set off an alarm.

In addition, within the Bari port,
the consortium will introduce

a sensor-based environmental
monitoring and control system to
gather information and prevent
potential risks tied to, for example,
fuel spillage, weather conditions
or pollution due to the transport of
containers by lorries.
