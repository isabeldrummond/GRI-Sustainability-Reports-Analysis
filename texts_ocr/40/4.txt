The Fastweb model.
Always a step ahead

1.1 ABOUT FASTWEB

Fastweb is the largest alternative landline operator in
Italy and one of the leading players in the European
ultra-broadband market. Since its inception in Milan in
1999, pursuing the innovative project of building a fiber
optic network and adopting the IP protocol for voice,
data and video transmission, Fastweb has focused on
innovation and network infrastructure for the supply of
ultra-broadband services of the highest quality.

The company has developed a national fiber-optic
network, reaching 8 million households and businesses
with its own proprietary network and, overall, 22 million
property units in more than 1,000 municipalities, with
connection speed of up to 1 Gigabit per second in major
cities. In 2018 Fastweb invested 28% of the company's
turnover in network expansion and service innovation.
This is an unprecedented percentage in the European
telecommunications scenario, equaling Euro 593 million.

Thanks to its network's architecture and flexibility,
Fastweb has diversified and enriched the offer to more
than 2.5 million customers to provide increasingly
convergent services. The goal is not only the provision
of innovative services, but also Internet access and use
anytime anywhere: in the office when using a computer,
on the go via smartphone or at home through the
devices connected to the home network.

As part of the mobile network services, in January 2017
Fastweb became a Full MVNO operator, offering its
customers a latest generation mobile service based on 4G
and 4G Plus technology. By 2020 mobile services will be
enhanced through a new-generation 5G infrastructure.

In addition to voice, data and mobile services, Fastweb
offers connectivity services and advanced ICT services,
such as housing, cloud computing, security and unified
communications, to companies of all sizes, from start-
ups to small and medium-sized businesses, from large
companies to the public sector.

The Fastweb model. Always a step ahead

Fastweb is present throughout the country with sites,
offices, equipment rooms and a network of stores
that currently comprises over 1,000 stores, including
flagship stores, franchise stores and authorized
dealers.The company has been part of the Swisscom
group since September 2007 and is managed and
coordinated by Swisscom AG through its subsidiary
Swisscom Italia S.rl.

Since 2014 Fastweb has held a 60% interest in the
joint-stock consortium company QXN, which was
established with the aim of providing Qualified
eXchange Network infrastructure to the Italian public
authorities.

Fastweb owns minority interests in Flash Fiber (20%)
and Open Hub Med (11%). Flash Fiber is the strategic
joint venture between Telecom Italia and Fastweb to
promote the creation of ultra-broadband infrastructure
with FTTH (Fiber To The Home) technology in major
Italian cities (see Chapter 2). Open Hub Med (OHM)

is the consortium that aspires to be the first neutral
hub in Italy for the exchange of communications in
the Mediterranean area between Africa, Middle East,
Asia and the rest of the world, benefiting from Sicily's
geographical position to route part of this traffic to the
main European hubs.

On 16 November 2018, an agreement was signed with
Tiscali S.p.A. to acquire the license for 40 Mhz in the 3.5
Ghz band and the fixed wireless access (FWA) business
unit consisting of, among other assets, roughly 835
base transceiver station towers, the related equipment
and 33 employees with network management
expertise.

On 7 August 2018, a new company we set up: Fastweb
Air S.r.l., wholly owned by Fastweb S.p.A., and which, on
16 November 2018, absorbed the aforementioned FWA
business unit.
