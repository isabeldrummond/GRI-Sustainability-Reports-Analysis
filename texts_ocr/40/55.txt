During the year, Fastweb remained committed

‘0 improving and simplifying its customers’ user
experience in all interactions with Fastweb. It improved
certain MyFASTPage functions - the restricted area

or customers where they can access all their account
information. Indeed, since 2018, they can ask to
upgrade to fiber as soon as it becomes available in

ust one click, and the subscription process for mobile
elephony services and the SIM card top-up procedure
have also been streamlined.

lew functions have been added to the MyFastweb app
as well, making it easier to sign up for new offers for
both fixed and mobile telephony services and to access
iveFAST from the app. In addition, mobile telephone
customers can now use a simplified version of the app
hat enables them, thanks to SIM authentication, view
how much credit they have used (voice minutes, data
traffic and text messages) without needing to enter their
username and password. Finally, interfacing with the
FASTGate modem is now more user-friendly and direct.

ew solutions were also created in 2018: a widget to
monitor your mobile telephone minutes directly on the
primary screen of your smartphone and the new My
CCID Seriale SIM app to view you SIM's serial number
without having to remove it from your phone.

 

To gauge the effects of this new business strategy

and the new offers on customer satisfaction, again

in 2018, Fastweb used the net promoter score (NPS),

a customer loyalty index developed on the basis of
response that customers gave to the question “How
likely is it that you would recommend the X company to
a friend or colleague?" on a scale of 1 to 10.

To score the company’s performance, customers were
divided into three categories:

m Promoters (score of 9-10): loyal customers who
will continue to purchase the services and will
recommend them to others;

m Passive customers (score of 7-8): customers who
are satisfied but indifferent, and could be potentially
influenced by competitors’ offers;

m Detractors (score of 0-6): unsatisfied customers who
could damage the company by spreading negative
word-of-mouth.

The index is calculated as the difference between

the percentage of Promoters and the percentage

of Detractors and is analyzed considering both the
customer's overall experience with Fastweb (relational
NPS) and their specific interaction (transactional NPS).

 

The frequency of the surveys varies from weekly to
half-yearly based on the parameter analyzed and the
customer group considered. In addition to the internal
surveys, benchmark analyses are carried out each
quarter.

In recent years, its strategy of focusing on customers,
combined with ongoing investments to improve the
quality and performance of services, has enabled Fastweb
to stand out as one of the fixed network operators most
frequently recommended by residential customers in Italy:
in particular, again in 2018, the findings emphasized
that Fastweb enjoys a 10% advantage above major
national telecommunications players.
