VISION, MEETING 207

TOGETHER TO-2020—

THE MANAGEMENT BOARD

Fastweb's Board of Directors has formally
established an advisory committee consisting of
managers not on the BoD, with the exception of
the CEO, who chairs this committee, known as the
Management Board.

The Management Board acts as the functional
coordinator for the activities of Fastweb's operating
units. This may include a preliminary analysis of
issues of strategic importance for future business
development and transactions that are significant in
terms of their impact on performance, the financial
position and equity. The Management Board also
advises on topics and transactions that the Board of
Directors submits to it.

ment Board's current members are: the
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the
Operating Officer, the Digital Transformation Officer, the
Human Capital Officer, the Chief Institutional & External
Relations Officer, the Chief Legal & Regulatory Affairs
Officer, the Marketing & Customer Experience Officer,
the Consumer & Small Business Officer, the Chief
Enterprise Officer, the Chief Wholesale Officer and the
Technology Officer.

The Manage!

 

For specific areas, certain members of the
Management Board are involved in Steering
Committees focused on certain issues, which meet
periodically to implement management's guidelines
and discuss the achievement of targets, progress, any
critical areas and improvement areas.

 

THE SHAREHOLDER'S MEETING

The by-laws establish the procedures for calling the
shareholder's meeting, the right to participate and proxies.
The meetings are chaired by the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, who is assisted by a secretary appointed by the
shareholder. During the meetings, the BoD sees that the
shareholder is apprised of the necessary information to
make knowledgeable decisions.

PROCEDURE FOR TRANSACTIONS
INVOLVING A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR
CONFLICTING WITH THE INTERESTS OF
OTHER DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES

In 2014 Fastweb established a procedure consisting of the
policies and operating rules that directors and employees
must follow to ensure the transparency and substantial
and procedural correctness of transactions that may
involve the interests of other directors or employees, or
that may present conflicts between the personal interests
of directors or employees and Fastweb's.

In compliance with the provisions of article 2391 of the
Italian Civil Code, the measures adopted supplement
the internal control system based on the Fastweb
Group's Code of Conduct and Fastweb's Organizational,
Management and Control Model. The procedure also
applies to the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors.

There were no circumstances leading to the application
of the procedure for transactions involving a conflict

of interest or conflicting with the interests of other
directors or employees in 2018.

The Fastweb model. Always astep ahead 11
