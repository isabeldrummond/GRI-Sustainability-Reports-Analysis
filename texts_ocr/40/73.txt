The annual survey on employees’
sense of belonging

The 2018 survey sent to all employees focused on
two elements: their emotional tie to the company,
i.e., the trust, admiration and, in general, feelings
that it instils, and a more rational assessment

of the company, described considering seven

key areas (Performance, Products and Services,
Innovation, Workplace, Governance, Civic
Responsibility and Leadership).

Approximately 90% of the company population
filled in the questionnaire, confirming workers'
desire to take part in company projects and a sense
of belonging throughout the company. The results
highlighted that the emotional tie to Fastweb is
strong, with a score of 78/100; furthermore, over
77% of respondents expressed enthusiasm with
the company's strategies.

The survey enabled the company to identify a few
improvement areas in terms of the recognition

of each individual employee's contribution, while
the mechanisms for vertical communications
and dialogue were scored as highly effective. In
particular, respondents recognized the value of
the CEO's video communications and confirmed
the significant growth in corporate and official
communication channels.

During the year, Fastweb continued activities to
engage social ambassadors, an in-house community

promoting the company's initiatives on social networks,

including the hashtag “#befw" (Be Fastweb). Again

in 2018, the social ambassadors took courses with
outside professionals to boost the engagement and
digital skills of members of the community in the fields
of cyber security, digital well-being, digital empathy,
digital content & information and digital data.

Finally, after the testing in Bari, specific focus on
engagement was devoted to the engagement-inducing
design of spaces in the new Milan office.

to promote the working smart model.

 

 

The new Milan office: space used for
growth and sharing

In 2018, work was completed on Fastweb's new
Milan office, which will stand in the Symbiosis
smart office district near the Porta Romana railway
station. The office was designed to hold nearly all
employees working in Milan, who will now share

a single hub where they can meet and exchange
information more easily.

The building, where operations will begin in
January 2019, represents a milestone for
Fastweb's approach to work, and is intended to
encourage a shift in mentality towards flexibility
and the achievement of individual objectives, while
ensuring ideal working conditions for personal and
company well-being.

The innovative nature of this project stems
from the building's structure and the solutions
that Fastweb has chosen for its systems and
organization to encourage working smart.
