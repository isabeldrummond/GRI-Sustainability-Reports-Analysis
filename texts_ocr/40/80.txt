5.6 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY AS A WIDESPREAD
CULTURE AND COLLECTIVE DUTY

Health and safety are vital issues that Fastweb is
committed to focusing on in order to minimize risks.
It develops targeted activities for employees and
suppliers who work at its offices, equipment rooms,
directly operated stores and construction sites.

For a structured management approach focused
on continuous improvement, since 2010, Fastweb
has adopted an Occupational Health and Safety
Management System that is certified according to
OHSAS 18001. In addition, a dedicated department,
supervised by the Head of Risk Prevention and
Protection, defines the policies and guidelines for
compliance with all occupational health and safety
regulations and carries out risk prevention and
protection activities each year to continuously improve
workers’ health and safety.

Workers’ Safety Representatives, 16 employees based
throughout all company locations and offices, serve

on the health and safety committees, representing the
entire company population. Together with the Prevention
and Protection Service Officials, the Workers’ Safety
Representatives carry out health and safety activities at
all Fastweb sites in their respective areas.

Health was given particular importance in 2018 with the
launch of a company heart emergency project, in which
a total of 23 semi-automatic defibrillators were installed
at all Fastweb offices, so immediate assistance may be
provided to any employees if necessary. To ensure the
prompt and proper use of devices, specific, four-hour
training courses have been provided since December

2017, with the involvement of 170 people throughout all
Fastweb's offices. This training will be offered each year
to ensure that trained people are always ready to take
action if needed.

During the year Fastweb also promoted an optional
vaccine campaign in which 233 people participated. In
addition, it held an awareness day at the Milan office
with the participation of the company doctor.

The company also updated its approach to mandatory
training with the roll-out of new e-learning courses

in addition to those offered as classroom courses.
Online training was used particularly for work-related
stress courses, which were introduced considering the
findings of a survey conducted on organizational well-
being in 2017.

In 2018, Fastweb provided a total of 3,432 hours of
mandatory training (1.3 hours per employee), 2,980 of
which in the classroom and 452 as e-learning.

Fastweb recorded 24 accidents at work in the year.

83% of injuries occurred in transit: these were accidents
that occurred, for example, while employees were
travelling to or from work. The injuries reported at
Fastweb sites were due to distractions or minor
accidents not attributable to the company's negligence
in the protection of worker safety.

Fastweb does not have any employees involved in work
duties that present a high rate or risk of specific illnesses.
