Accordingly, the work is based on a correlation analysis’
between the DAI and the 17 SDGs, beginning with a set
of 81 indicators relating to the SDGs analyzed for 157
countries around the world.

The results show a highly positive relationship between
these two variables’, with a coefficient of 0.78, which
indicates that an increase in digitalization, such as an
increase in the number of connected people and devices,
is tied to positive progress in achieving the SDGs.

In particular, 11 of the 17 SDGs (65% of the total) present
a positive correlation with the DAI, while five SDGs do
not show a clear correlation and goal 12 “Responsible
production and consumption” has a negative correlation.

The goals that are most highly correlated with the DAI
are social goals and specifically relate to improvements
in the quality of life, above all goal 3, and economic goals

promoting fair growth, mos

significantly goals 8 and 9.

These results can be traced back to the very
characteristics of digital technologies, which center

around people and are capable of promoting the
development of new business models.

The analysis showed that the only environmental SDG
with a negative correlation to digitalization is goal 12
“Responsible production and consumption models", which
also focuses on promoting the efficient use of resources
and reduction of waste, mainly due to the sector's impact in
terms of technological waste production.
