the Code of Conduct and the Model, while newly hired
employees recent an e-mail containing information on
the Code of Conduct and the 231 Model and are required
to take an e-learning course on these topics.

In November 2018, a new e-learning training course

began for all personnel, which covers updates to the 231
legislation, the 231 Model, the Code of Conduct, the anti-
corruption guidelines and the whistleblowing procedure.

Furthermore, classroom training sessions were
organized during the year on:

= “Public invitations to tender”: a multi-disciplinary ilex
(internal learning experience) course for Enterprise
teams (KAM, pre-sale, PMs) which covers various
topics, including compliance with Italian Legislative
Decree 231/2001 insofar as it relates to crimes
committed in public contracts (77 trainees);

= “External activity management” with a focus on
the management of consultants: this course was
organized with Internal Audit and Human Capital for
Enterprise teams (pre-sale, provisioning, PMs, service
operations) on legal risks, 231 risks and labor law
risks in connection with the operational management
of consultants (27 trainees);

= “Whistleblowing": for HC Business Partners
with a focus on the operational management of
whistleblowers in terms of Human Capital.

People working on Fastweb's behalf but who are not
employees, are also informed of the control principles
and standards in the Model, which apply to them. Under
specific contractual clauses, these people undertake
within the scope of their relationships with the
company to comply with current regulations and, in any
case, to prevent the committing - and the attempted
committing - of the crimes subject to the sanctions of
Italian Legislative Decree 231/01.

THE SUPERVISORY BODY

To monitor that the 231 Model is properly applied,
Fastweb has appointed its own Supervisory Body
(SB), formed of the Chairman of the Independent
Control Committee, the Chief Audit Executive and an
independent criminal lawyer. The members have the
same term of office as the BoD that appointed them.

In 2018, with the support of the Senior Manager of
Compliance & Risk Management, the Supervisory

Body conducted supervisory activities on all business
divisions, which consisted of 19 audits on the content
of the periodic information that it received and two
compliance audits. The Supervisory Body reports to the
BoD on any critical issues relating to its range of action
(application of the 231 Model).

The audits mainly focused on issues relating to the risk
of corruption, while the compliance audits concerned
the management of sub-contracting and compliance
with Italian Legislative Decree 136/2010 on the
traceability of financial flows.

The supervisory activities are included in the Integrated
Strategic Audit Plan (ISAP) presented annually to the
Independent Control Committee, and mainly focus

on monitoring that the Model is effectively applied in
the areas most at risk of crime. The SB organizes the
activities, ensuring that sensitive activities are audited
regularly.

Information is reported to the SB in accordance with
article 6, paragraph 2, letter d) of Italian Legislative
Decree 231/01. The SB discusses the types and
frequency of these reports with the respective internal
managers of sensitive processes who follow the
agreed methods and meet the established deadlines. At
present, 26 reports have been established (sent by 24
reporters).
