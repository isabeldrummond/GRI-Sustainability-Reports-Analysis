restrictions and no additional costs.

“Space”, the seventh and final initiative of 2018,
makes Fastweb the only telephony operator to give its

customers unlimited storage space for digital pictures,

videos and music.

Accessible using the WOW Space app, this service
includes integrated tags and geo-localization features

to help users find their pictures and videos easily and
share them quickly and securely.

Based on the results it has achieved, Fastweb aims to
intensify the cardinal pillars of this strategy throughout
its business, as it continues to invest in the quality of
its services and customer relationships to maintain

its position of excellence in the telecommunications
industry.
