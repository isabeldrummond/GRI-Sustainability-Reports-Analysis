The topics investigated concern how much
stakeholders appreciate Fastweb, both in terms of its
reputation and considering rational elements such as
product quality, its ability to innovate, the quality of the
workplace, ethics and long-term strategic vision.

In 2017, the multi-stakeholder approach already
consisted of engaging external stakeholders (enterprise
customers, talent, public opinion, opinion leaders and
personnel in direct contact with customers) and internal
stakeholders (employees), on a continuous to annual
basis depending on the target stakeholders.

The group of stakeholders involved was expanded in

2018 with the engagement of residential customers.

The stakeholder expectations monitored in 2018
focused most on transparency in the way we

operate on the market and in direct and continuous
relationships with customers (paragraph 4.1), as with
ethics in management (paragraph 1.3), the company's
positive influence on society (chapter 2) and service
quality and reliability (chapter 4).

In general, Fastweb found all the stakeholders involved
in this feedback project had highly positive perceptions
in 2018.
