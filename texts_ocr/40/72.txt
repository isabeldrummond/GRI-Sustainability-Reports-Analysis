5.3 FROM “SMART WORKING” TO “WORKING SMART"

We are committed each and every day to
creating a work environment where people are
valued and their perspective is considered.

This means cultivating a positive, inclusive,
eee RIB elt
free to express their full potential.

 

Since 2015, and in step with contemporary
echnological and cultural changes, Fastweb has
pursued a new approach to thinking about working
styles in the company, starting with a smart working
pilot project that is the first of its kind in Italy.
nnovative and flexible, smart working enables workers
o decide where they want to work, and provides them
with the technological tools they need to complete all
heir tasks.

Not only is smart working aimed at facilitating a
healthy work/life balance, but it is also meant to
change the work culture within the company, with more
lexibility and individual responsibility, and is now a

ully integrated way of working that workers are using

widely, making Fastweb a smart work leader in the
talian telecommunications industry.

Over the years, Fastweb has continued to think about
the meaning and the potential developments of this
project, transforming its ideas into the concept of
“working smart" and undertaking to revolutionize

its way of working by focusing on participation,
accountability, efficiency and flexibility, thanks in part
to the constant use of new technologies to improve
communication and company life.

Listening and reaching out to workers have been
crucial to the company's approach. Again in 2018,
Fastweb continued to reinforce and multiply meetings
and exchanges with workers, not only to improve the
climate within the company and communications with
and between people, but also to involve workers in
the definition of the company's plans and projects for
innovation and co-design.

For example, Fastweb proposed the appointment

of 18 change players to promote a new way of
working. Specifically, in 2018, these change players
focused on effective meetings, a topic that is
particularly important to people at various levels of the
organization. All employees’ needs were considered
through an online survey to which 1,142 people
responded. Six design thinking workshops were held
in which the change players described a few golden
rules that will be applied on an experimental basis
over the next few months.

 

Considering the success of the first edition and

the innovative ideas that arose, Fastweb intends to
continue to make the most of these change players
as catalysts for action and new ideas to spread the
working smart approach throughout the company.

In addition, with the same objective of changing the
way in which people work, four work groups were
created in 2018 to update compensation processes
and develop a lean organization, improve internal
mechanisms for the delegation of duties and enhance
and celebrate the results achieved and continuous
feedback: these aspects have been identified as key
elements in the development of working methods
within the company, as they are crucial to the
accountability and self-awareness of people.
