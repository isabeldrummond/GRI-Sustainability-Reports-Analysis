4.2 ACONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING OFFER

This year, the market strategies in Fastweb's three
business segments remained focus on customers and
the development of products and services to meet their
requests and needs: the Consumer, Micro Business
(freelance professionals) and Small Business segment,
which includes households, professionals, micro-
businesses and small businesses, the Enterprise segment,
for medium-size companies, large companies and the
public authorities - and the Wholesale segment which
consists of connection services for OLOs (other licensed
operators, i.e., those that are not major market players).

Fastweb remained a leader in the Consumer, Micro
Business and Small Business market thanks to its
strategy based on quality, transparency and solutions
that are increasingly geared towards convergence, as
described earlier in this report.

The ongoing expansion of Fastweb's proprietary fiber
optic infrastructure, the option it gives customers to
switch over to more advanced technology when it
becomes available without any charge or cost increase,
and the advantages offered by the various areas of
#nientecomeprima are only a few of the policies that
have enabled Fastweb to retain its market share and
attract more than 2.5 million customers.

It has also reached significant partnerships in this
business segment: in addition to the long-standing
partnership with Sky, Fastweb has introduced a joint
offer with Eni, the utility company, for residential
customers, for Fastweb Internet services and Eni Gas e
Luce electricity and natural gas services with generous
discounts and benefits.

In the Business segment (for freelance professionals
and small businesses), Fastweb has continued to
simplify its landline offer for micro businesses, giving
them an easy choice between two set plans (Business
Internet and Business Class). Customers with ADSL
and Bitstream connections will continue to enjoy a
special monthly rate until they migrate to the fiber optic
network when it reaches them.

To help companies digitalize and switch over to cloud
solutions, the small business portfolio has expanded to
include two new services: a platform to help customers
promote their business online and storage-as-a-service
for the creation of data storage space on the cloud.

In March 2018, Fastweb responded to the needs of
freelancers and small businesses with its new Business
Freedom offer, offering more minutes and gigabytes.

Results remain positive in the Enterprise market as

well, where Fastweb has been the only Italian player to
see its market share up 2% both in the Top/Executive
segment (from 29% to 31%) and the Medium segment
(from 18% to 20%).

This growth is due to its core service consolidation
strategy, which is driving corporate customers’ faster
adoption of digital services and customer loyalty.
Projects and testing in the innovative fields of 5G, the
Internet of Things, software-defined networking'®,
security and the cloud have been crucial to this growth.
Fastweb has rolled out two new cloud-based solutions
for IT security in particular. FAST Security 360° Cloud,
which fully protects the entire company network
against cyber attacks, and FAST Security Advanced
Protection, a new generation antivirus that defends
against both traditional viruses and sophisticated
attacks like malware and zero-day threats.

In addition, the company has introduced the Fast SIEM
service, which provides customers with a platform that
collects, stores and analyzes IT system and network
device logs in an integrated, automated manner,
significantly reducing management costs and ensuring
integrity, confidentiality and the inalterability of the
collected data. Finally, to offer a service that genuinely
covers 360 degrees and support customers in their
selection and management of the most sophisticated
solutions, a team of highly-skilled Security Service
Managers has been created to provide specific advice
on all cyber security matters. As for cloud solutions,
2018 saw the consolidation of the services offered and
dramatic growth in new customers, thanks to the ability
to direct various ICT needs on a wider range of the
Enterprise segment.

In 2018, the new European data protection regulation
known as the GDPR went into effect, and to help its
customers comply with the GDPR, Fastweb has created
Fast GDPR Suite, an integrated solution designed to
simplify and speed up the compliance process.

This new solution is extremely clear and transparent,
as it provides a gap analysis and an action plan based
onan in-depth assessment of company systems and
procedures.

Important new solutions were also unveiled in the
company core services, including one in particular that is
the first of its kind on the Italian Enterprise market: SD-
WAN Carrier Grade transforms company networks into
programmable software platforms that are extremely
scalable and integrated in the Fastweb's national
network infrastructure, allowing customers to configure

19.Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is a new cloud computing approach to network architecture that facilitates administration and configuration to improve

performance and facilitate monitoring
