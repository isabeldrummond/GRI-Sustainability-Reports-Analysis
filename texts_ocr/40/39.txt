In February, the #Roma5G project also entered the
operating stage, involving the collaboration of Fastweb,
Ericsson, Roma Capitale and Atac. Within the scope of the
protocol of understanding that the various players signed
in 2017, certain scopes of application for the 5G network
testing have been identified, ranging from the enhancement
of Rome's cultural and artistic heritage (already rolled out
at the Terme di Diocleziano) to the development of security
services using innovative tele-surveillance systems and
the development of urban mobility applications.

With the Rome municipal authorities, in July, the company
also signed a protocol of understanding to implement
projects based on 5G and wi-fi technologies, with the
aim of developing digital applications for smart cities
and loT, to be applied by 2020 in certain areas of Rome.

In July, Fastweb signed a protocol of understanding
with the Genoa municipal authorities and Ericsson to
begin testing based on 5G technologies and wi-fi for
the development of last-generation services within the
scope of the “Genova 5G" project.

 

During the year, in collaboration with
li Digital Magics, the “Together for
9) 5G" Call for Innovation contest was
announced, in which Fastweb aims
to motivate and unite companies,
SMEs and start-ups that have designed solutions
and services that stand to benefit from 5G. The most
innovative solutions will be given access to a 5G LAB:
a testing and co-creation process with the Marketing
and Technology teams, which will result in new
services for end customers and additional business
opportunities for both Fastweb and the winning
companies.

In late 2017, Fastweb joined the 5G Infrastructure
Association (5G IA), a network aimed at encouraging
the spread of 5G technology throughout Europe. 5G
IA represents the European private sector within the
5G Public-Private Partnership (5G-PPP), one of the
largest 5G research programs in the world, which was
established as part of Horizon 2020, the integrated
financing system for EU research activities.
