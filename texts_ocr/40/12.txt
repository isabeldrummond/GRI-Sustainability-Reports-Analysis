1.3 ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE: WE ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR OURSELVES AND OTHERS

THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Internal Control and Risk Management System is
the set of rules, procedures and organizational structures
to enable the identification, measurement, management
and monitoring of the main business risks.

Fastweb has defined the players and the functioning

of its internal control system in the “Internal Control
and Risk Management System-Assurance Framework
Directive”. In addition to the Board of Directors, the CEO,
231&262 Compliance, Risk Management, the CFO, the
Board of Statutory Auditors, the Management Board,
the Independent Auditors, Management and employees,
this system also includes:

= The Independent Control Committee, which assists
the Board of Directors by providing advice and
recommendations concerning the internal control
system;

= the Supervisory Body, which is in charge of
monitoring the 231 Model's effectiveness and
adequacy of the 231 Model with regard to its effective
ability to reduce the risk of the crimes covered by
Italian Legislative Decree 231/01 being committed,
that all addressees of the 231 Model comply with it
and that it is updated to meet changes in company
conditions;

= Internal Audit, which verifies that the internal control and
risk management system is functional and adequate.

Fastweb has also adopted an Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) framework and procedures for
identifying, analyzing, monitoring and mitigating any
risks to which the company could be exposed.

This framework is structured into processes and
models in line with industry best practices and
guarantees extensive coverage of risk assessment and
mitigation, which are carried out jointly with the units/
departments responsible for the different risks.

Compliance & Risk Management, working within the
Internal Audit, Compliance & Risk Management Division
is responsible for designing, managing and maintaining
this system, which also provides for Risk Assessment
cycles carried out by different units quarterly to
annually, depending on the risk classification.

 

A Risk Owner is assigned to each identified risk and

is responsible for preparing the risk mitigation or

risk acceptance plan. Risk reviews are carried out
periodically with Risk Owners, and the effectiveness of
the measures taken by the Measure Owners appointed
over time in the risk mitigation plan is reassessed.

With the support of the units responsible for individual
risks, an updated quarterly risk status report is also
prepared, tailored to meet the needs of each of the
relevant stakeholders (Swisscom, the Independent
Control Committee and senior management).

THE 231 MODEL

In compliance with Italian Legislative Decree 231/01,
Fastweb has adopted an organizational model that
establishes the main rules of conduct for all the
company's employees and defines the processes,
areas, "sensitive" activities (i.e., those at risk of a
crime covered by Legislative Decree 231/01) and the
associated controls. The aforementioned Code of
Conduct is also an integral part of the 231 Model. In
its most recent version, which the Board of Directors
approved on 26 July 2018, the Code of Conduct
includes updates concerning the anti-corruption
guidelines and compliance with personal data
protection legislation (GDPR).

The 231 Model is regularly updated to reflect
developments in legislation and organizational
changes. In particular, during the year, the Model was
supplemented with the anti-corruption guidelines

in the areas at risk of bribery (both in the public and
private sector) and to include the additional crimes
(e.g,, illegal intermediation and labor exploitation).
Furthermore, updates were made the sections of
the Model concerning whistleblowing, with regard to
the disciplinary system, to reflect developments in
legislation.

To spread a culture and knowledge of risk management
and prevention and awareness of the importance of
effectively complying with the Model, Fastweb has
organized mandatory e-learning courses for all its
employees, constantly updating the content of these
courses to reflect changes in legislation and the
company.

At 31 December 2018, 100% of employees, regardless of
their contractual level, participated in training on Italian
Legislative Decree 231/01, on the 231 Model and the
corruption crimes covered by Legislative Decree 231/01".
All employees are immediately informed of updates to

1. The percentages indicated refer to employees registered for the course and present at the company when it was offered as e-learning (the percentages do not include new
hires from September to December 2018, who will complete the training in the first few months of 2019, or employees who were continuously absent for personal reasons
from May to December 2018, who were unable to access the e-learning when it was available)
