1.4 2018 STRATEGIES AND RESULTS.
MILESTONES ARE THE NEW START LINE

THE BUSINESS CONTEXT AND STRATEGY

The Italian telecommunications service market in which
Fastweb operates is the fourth largest in Europe, with
end customers spending roughly 28 billion euro for
landline and mobile services (Chart 1).

After a slight increase in 2017, the market value fell
in 2018: landline spending remained steady while
the mobile market saw a decrease due to a spike in
competition with the arrival of a new player, Iliad.

and 2018 (€ billions)

between Italy and other European countries,
improvements in Italy in recent years have been
possible thanks to substantial investments by
operators, mainly Telecom Italia and Fastweb, which
have radically changed the ultra-broadband service
market. Indeed, these services are now available to
over 80% of Italian homes and businesses and have
become the top offer for all major telecommunication
operators in Italy through wholesale access to the
incumbent's fiber network (VULA and bitstream
NGA).

Although data traffic grew by over 50% from roughly
2.5 to 3.6 Gigabyte per SIM card’, the mobile market
came to approximately 15 billion Euros, down 5% on
the previous year. The number of human SIM cards
(which only offer voice, SMS and data services),

is currently down to roughly 83 million, while the
number of “"M2M" SIM cards (featuring new loT
technologies) has now exceeded 18 million.

The landline service market remained steady, thanks
to the contribution of ultra-broadband services
(speeds of over 30 Megabit per second), offsetting
the decline in voice-only lines. The total number

of broadband connections on the landline network
increased again in 2018 to 16.1 million, although
the growth rate was lower than in 2017 (chart 2).
The level of broadband service penetration reached
approximately 54% of homes and business, but
remains far below average European penetration of
over 70%.

At the end of 2018, ultra-broadband lines numbered
roughly 6.5 million, over 40% more than at year end
2017, with TIM, Fastweb and Vodafone holding nearly
the entire market.

OpEnFiber, the Enel Group company established in

2015 to establish a fiber optic access network in

major Italian cities and sell wholesale connectivity to
telecommunication companies, has also contributed
significantly to digitalization. OpEnFiber S.p.A.'s aim

is to cover more than 9 million homes with FTTH
infrastructure, increasing the level of competition in the
infrastructure and, in 2017, it won two public contracts
for the create of a public network in areas where the
market had been unable to do so.

The merger of Wind/Infostrada with H3G was another
change on the telecommunications market. In May
2018, one of the main consequences of this change
was the arrival of a new player on the market, Iliad,
which was awarded the market “remedies” (for

both frequencies and infrastructure) imposed by
