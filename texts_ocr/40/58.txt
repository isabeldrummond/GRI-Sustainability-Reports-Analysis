transparency and simplicity for consumers.

In particular, a Single Fair Settlement Guarantor,
responsible for evaluating whether the fair negotiation
procedures are compliant, and a single protocol

for the settlement procedure applicable to all
telecommunications companies make it easier to
reach a positive agreement, and therefore easier for
consumers to use this procedure.

To begin the ADR procedure, Fastweb customers may
refer to the signatory associations only after having filed
a complaint and not have received a response within

45 days, or if they are unsatisfied with the response
received. They may then request the associations to file a
claim for settlement. The claim is uploaded to a specific
portal (https://www.fastweb it/corporate/governance/

conciliazioni-e-associazioni-consumatori/?Ing=EN) where

the case is managed directly online, with a record of all
negotiations, the settlement and the reasons.

Customers may also send requests directly to the
Settlement Office by registered letter with return receipt
or by email to adrfastweb@pec.fastweb.it. Again in

his case, the requests are sent to a specific portal
via a Conciliator identified by the Settlement Office
on a rotating basis. A Fair Settlement Commission,
consisting of a Fastweb Conciliator and a Conciliator
rom the chosen association, then evaluate the
individual requests.

To help spread this practice and proper ADR
procedures, in 2018, Fastweb actively collaborated
with the Consumer Forum, an independent association
established to promote mutual knowledge and
overcome the difficulties of dialogue between
consumers associations and businesses. In particular,
Fastweb supported and contributed to, including with
its direct participation, specialist training to update
accredited conciliators.

n 2018, the Settlement Office received 1,441 claims
rom the consumers associations. After the claims
were examined to verify whether they are admissible,
1,178 settlement cases began, 96.7% of which (1,139
cases) were settled with a positive report, i.e., to the
customer's complete satisfaction. 3.3% of the cases
were completed without an agreement being reached.
