the European Commission as conditions for the
authorization of the merger. This has led the major
operators to pursue a strategy based on landline/
mobile convergence to boost customer loyalty in view
of the new player's arrival and the resulting rise in price
competition.

TIM and Vodafone have also introduced satellite brands
(Kena and ho., respectively), with offers featuring prices
and selling propositions that are similar to lliad's.

In this context, after having undertaken various
initiatives to improve its mobile offer and convergence
position, Fastweb confirmed its landline strategy, which
has always been based on the enhancement of its
network infrastructure and technological innovation,
and further strengthened its position in mobile services,
launching new offers and investing increasingly in 5G
technology, both in terms of technological testing (as
described in chapter 3, for example the Ministry of

Economic Development tender in Bari and Matera),

and investments in strategic assets that enable this
technology, with the acquisition, through the subsidiary
Fastweb Air S.rl., of the Fixed Wireless Access business
unit and Tiscali’s 3.5 GHz spectrum and the acquisition
of a spectrum of 26 GHz band in a public auction.

Strengthening its position in the business segment by
enhancing the Tiscali business unit acquired in 2017 and
a continued focus on customer experience and service
quality are two key elements of the business strategy.

Together, these activities have led to outstanding
results. In 2018, the number of Fastweb customers rose
by 4% to over 2.5 million, while revenues grew by 8.2%,
with most of the growth concentrated in revenues from
the sale of network infrastructure (+104.6%), revenues
from new customer activation (+40.2%), revenues

from hardware sales (+33.9%) and revenues from
interconnection (+20.6%).

VALUE DISTRIBUTED TO STAKEHOLDERS

This reflects the economic value distributed to the
company's stakeholders: to employees through
remuneration, to the public authorities through taxes,
to communities through donations, sponsorships and
gifts and to the company itself through self-financing.

To calculate this value, Fastweb applies the GBS 2013
social report guidelines of Gruppo di Studio Bilancio
Sociale, which recommend reclassifying certain
income statement items and supplementing them with

information on the allocation of profit for the period
broken down by the company's stakeholder groups.
Added value is detailed in two separate, reconciling
tables: Total Added Value, which consists of revenues,
net of production costs, and Distributed Added Value,
which is the sum of internal and external stakeholders’
remuneration.®

In 2018, the increase in Fastweb's operating costs and
expenses - despite the growth in revenues - generated
a reduction in the amount of added value distributed to
stakeholders from €412.0 to €335.8 million (-18.5%).

4. In 2018, Fastweb's EBITDA totalled €674,453 thousand, down €758,822 thousand on EBITDA of €698,596 thousand in 2017. 2017 EBITDA included the positive impact of
non-recurring items classified as “Other revenues and income". Without these items, EBITDA would have increased by 6% from 2017 to 2018.
5. In accordancé with the methodology applied, the value distributed to suppliers is considered a production cost and is equal to the costs incurred to purchase goods and services.
