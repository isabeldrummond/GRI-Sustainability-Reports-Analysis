2.2 ICT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT:
A HIGH-IMPACT COMBINATION

Each year, ASVIS, the Italian Alliance for Sustainable
Development, prepares an "“ASVIS Report" to monitor the
country's progress with respect to the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) and emphasize the need

‘or a global shift in order to implement an inclusive,
sustainable and people-oriented development model in

European countries and Italy are no exception: one
quarter of the European population is still at risk of
poverty and social exclusion, and unemployment and
underemployment remain rampant. In Italy, specifically,
progress on goals 2 “Sustainable food and agriculture",
3 "Good health and well-being”, 4 “Quality education",
5 "Gender equality”, 9 “Innovation”, 12 “Responsible
production and consumption models" and 13 “Climate
change" has been, unfortunately, offset by worsening
poverty, labor, inequality, conditions in cities and
biodiversity (goals 1, 8, 10, 11 and 15).

n this context, ICT companies can offer a significant
contribution. As highlighted in the report “Enabling the
Global Goals. Evidence of digital solutions’ impact on
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)"
published in 2018 by the Global e-Sustainability
nitiative® (GeSi) in collaboration with Accenture,
integrating sustainability in process innovation and

he consequent provision of digital solutions that

 

ine with the objectives set by the United Nations in 2015.

positively impact the SDGs, in fields as diversified as
virtual learning, smart agriculture and e-health, could
generate significant results by 2030, in addition to new
opportunities for the digital industry, estimated to total
2.1 trillion dollars.

The report is based on the Digital Access Index (DAI), a
new framework of indicators developed to monitor the

ICT sector's contribution to overcoming the challenges
of sustainable development on a periodic basis, starting
with three categories of KPIs:

a) connectivity, in turn broken down into three sub-
categories: infrastructure (with indicators like the
percentage of 4G network coverage and the number
of Internet access points), the use, consisting of
KPIs on the use of technology (e.g., the number of
broadband accounts on fixed and mobile lines and
smartphone market penetration) and accessibility,
with indicators such as the cost of mobile phone
rates or the cost of specific rates for mobile devices;

b) technologies, with indicators like mobile M2M
connections and social media penetration;

c) digital solutions with monitoring KPls on the
penetration of technologies like smart working and
e-health.
