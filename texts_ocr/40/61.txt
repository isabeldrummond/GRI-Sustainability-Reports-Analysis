To inform and sensitize employees about the
importance of effectively complying with the GDPR
and its accountability principle, in November 2017, a
required initial e-learning course was given, describing
the main legislative changes and their impact on the
company.

In May 2018, when the GDPR went into force, another
e-learning course was held to teach all employees
about the organizational changes made to comply

with the requirements of the Regulation. The two
courses saw a response rate of 98.08% of the company
population.

Also in keeping with this commitment, from March
2017 to May 2018, 20 classroom lessons and webinars
were offered on general and specific issues for each
team, targeting roughly 900 people, with around 700
people taking part.

The GDPR requires that a national authority, which in
Italy is the Personal Data Protection Authority, monitors
compliance with the Regulation and ensures proper
data processing and compliance with the fundamental
rights of people in connection with personal data
processing.”°

The Personal Data Protection Authority's supervisory
