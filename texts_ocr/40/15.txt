Many of the company's internal policies relate to
management systems, which Fastweb has voluntarily
had certified in accordance with specific standards.
These systems have been integrated to create a single
management system that guides internal operations
and ensures the proper application of company
policies in the various operating areas. This system
includes: process quality (ISO 9001), information
and data security (ISO 27001), privacy management
for public cloud services (ISO 27018), environment
(ISO 14001), occupational health and safety (OHSAS
18001), |CT service management (ISO 20000) and

business continuity (ISO 22301).

In 2018 Fastweb expanded its management system
further, earning a certificate of conformity with ISO
27017 for the introduction of information security
controls for cloud services and a certificate of
conformity with ISO 27035, which specifies the
methods to follow to manage and prevent information
security incidents. In both cases, these are additional
security measures that guarantee customers
information security in the provision of services always
in line with industry best practices.
