constructive feedback. This program is structured in
layers, with 44 sessions for a total of 530 attendees
and 354 people involved, with three main modules:
Empowering Dialogue, FOM (Fundamentals of
Management) and Game for Managers.

Empowering Dialogue was kicked off in 2017, involving
the first layer of Division Directors, and was expanded
in 2018 with the extension of all second layer Division
Directors and their staff, to strengthen and reinforce
managerial competencies and provide the necessary
tools to provide valuable feedback.

FOM is a training module on the managerial
competencies that are fundamental for Fastweb,
offered to all first-time coordinators, while the

Game for Managers involved all managers at the
company, starting with the third layer: in this case, two
days of workshops were held to discuss, including
through games, the characteristics of the three
managerial competencies covered in the performance
management model (Lead performance, Develop
people, Be inclusive with everyone).

The Skillathlon was another particularly important
training initiative held in 2018, consisting of a

series of meetings, workshops and labs to spread a
shared vision of the five skills introduced in the new
performance review model that Fastweb adopted at
the end of 2017 with the entire company population.

The Skillathlon consisted of 65 classroom lessons,
inspirational speeches, workshops and labs with over
1300 attendees, and the publication of 2,060 articles in
the company training tool available to all employees at
any time.

Specific attention was also devoted to professional
training, with classroom lessons constituting roughly
45% of total training provided in 2018. As in previous
years, the most important courses included Marketing
Academy, for all staff on the Marketing team, to share
with them the main trends in the sector. This initiative
targeted the marketing group, with a total of 369
attendees, and consisted of meetings, testimonies and
workshops on problem solving for a total of 43 hours of
training per participant.

Another training course organized during the year was
HR for HR, on working practices and methodologies for
the Human Capital and Change Management team.

Another professional training event was for ILEX
speakers, who are Fastweb employees who share their
knowledge and hold classroom courses open to all
employees. Launched in 2018, ILEX Innovation Journey
is a growth and development process consisting of
2018 days of training over two years with the primary
aim of providing new solutions to make lessons more
engaging and effective, with the use of digital tools and
innovative teaching methods such as gamification.
