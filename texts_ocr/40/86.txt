The Fastweb network's energy efficiency can

be measured by comparing the indirect energy
consumption of equipment rooms and cabinets with
data traffic over the past five years. The resulting trend
highlights a progressive reduction in the network's
energy intensity, with a decrease of nearly 60% in the
consumption of kWh per traffic Gigabyte. In particular,
2018 saw a decrease of 10% on 2017.

These results demonstrate that the effectiveness

of projects carried out to improve the efficiency of
technological systems, especially the many projects

in recent years to upgrade, expand and strengthen the
infrastructure and increase data traffic volumes (which
grew by 23% in 2018 alone).

The company has not wavered in its constant
commitment to procure energy from renewable sources
during the year: 100% of the electricity it procures
directly originates from renewable sources. In addition,
the solar power systems installed in 2016 at the main
data centers generated and used a total of 142,251

kWh in 2018, down slightly on the previous year (-7%).

Direct energy consumption is mainly due to the
consumption of diesel and natural gas.

Natural gas is used in the thermal power plants at
the office buildings®, while diesel is used to run the
electrical generators that power equipment rooms to
ensure network continuity and for traction. Executives

and employees who regularly visit other parties outside
the company mainly use diesel-fueled cars.

Furthermore, the calculation of direct energy consumption
includes the petrol used by the car sharing fleet, which

consists entirely of hybrid (electric/petrol) cars available to
all personnel for both business trips and occasional travel.
