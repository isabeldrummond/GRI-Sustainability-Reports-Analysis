 

LiveFAST

 

THE PROJECT

LiveFAST is the free loyalty program that Fastweb offers its residential customers with landline,
mobile or landline + mobile contracts. It consists of awards and benefits that increase in value in
proportion to how long the customer has been with the company.

 

Again in 2018, liveFAST - which reached over 500,000 customers, up by more than 50% on 2017
year end - was expanded and improved, in terms of both the benefits offered and the customer
experience, to become even more attractive.

Not only did the range of benefits grow, but they are now offered in new ways. One of the new developments is
“dreamFAST", a daily instant-win contest. With a simple click, customers open a package, raise a window shade
on an airplane, wake a sleeping girl and discover whether they've won. The awards change every month and range
from round-trip airline tickets in Europe for two to Amazon and Marionnaud gift cards, with the aim of meeting all
customers’ desires.

“SpeedDate" is another new initiative. This promotion is held on the first and 15th days of each month and lasts
one week, during which customers may sign up for valuable offers based on the preferences they have expressed.
For example, it has consisted of prizes for techies, like Samsung products, and initiatives for homes, like the offer
developed with the Bubuck start-up, in which children could write their own fairy tale in a customized book.

As for customer experience, liveFAST has been integrated in the MyFastPage for customers, giving them access to
the platform directly from their personal page, simplifying their online experience.

As this program is updated continuously, again this year, Fastweb was recognized for its excellence, coming

in 1st place at the 2018 NC Awards, which for over a decade has vetted and rewarded Italian excellence

in communications projects. In particular, liveFAST was awarded as the “Best Loyalty Program" in the
telecommunications category and received the top price

CN in the Loyalty Programs category at the XXV Edition of the

GrandPrix Relational Strategies, for the most innovative
and effective relational marketing techniques.
