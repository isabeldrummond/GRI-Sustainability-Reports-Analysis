THE PROJECT

WOW FI is Fastweb's open wi-fi solution providing high-quality network coverage outside the
home. With this service, every Fastweb modem is a homespot available to Fastweb customers,
so they can access the Internet wherever they are and without any additional charges. All mobile
Fastweb customers may surf the net on their smartphones with the WOW FI network, enjoying
unlimited traffic and simple, immediate access via SIM 4G authentication

 

With the “MyFastweb" app, users can monitor the quality of their WOW FI connection, check their previous WOW FI
sessions and traffic logs and view a geo-localized map of all hotspots and homespots.

WOW FI is now the largest wi-fi network in Italy: thanks to the infrastructural investments in 2018 and customers’
confirmations that they will continue to participate, coverage has increasingly expanded over time, now reaching all
the towns in Italy where Fastweb services are available.
