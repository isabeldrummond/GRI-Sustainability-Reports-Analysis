Letter to stakeholders

The digital revolution is driving radical change and we

at Fastweb strongly believe in its potential to improve

the quality of life. The numbers speak for themselves:
digitalization has the potential to help shape a more
inclusive development model that respects the
environment and offers a host of new opportunities for
businesses, workers and residents alike, facilitating the
achievement of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals
in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

However, to benefit from new technologies, we

must work on the conditions that enable them -
infrastructure, innovation and skills - and are capable
of transforming technological trends into true catalysts
for well-being and sustainable and development. Its
desire to make a difference in this arena is the basis
for Fastweb's interpretation of sustainability as a
genuine commitment to upholding its mission of
“improving life and work through the Internet”. With
projects that engage all stakeholders, Fastweb is
intent on integrating corporate social responsibility in
its business, in accordance with the parent company
Swisscom's sustainability strategy.

Demonstrating its contribution to digitalization, Fastweb
has continued to invest in 2018 to position itself at the
technological forefront, acting as an ambassador for
innovation for 20 years. This has led us to work on the
FTTH and FTTN network development plans kicked

off in recent years and to continue investing in 5G and

the integration of landline infrastructure with mobile
technology to become the top convergence operator in the
country.

We are confident that this strategy will pay off: network
infrastructure, skills, the desire to create a future in

which technology is an ally not only in the provision of
increasingly higher performance connectivity services, but
also to enable new solutions serving communities and
residents.

The results attained this year with 5G testing in Bari and
Matera - as part of the Ministry of Economic Development
tender that we won with TIM and Huawei - and those

to come with forthcoming 5G initiatives in partnership
with the Rome municipal authorities, Ericsson and ATAC

- demonstrate that we are headed in the right direction.
Projects like telemedicine to provide home assistance to
the Bari hospital's hematology/oncology patients, the use
of augmented reality for technical training as part of the
Industry 4.0 agenda tested with ship engine maker Isotta
Fraschini and the smart port solution to monitor security at
the Bari port make us proud of our work and demonstrate
how new technologies can truly make a difference in
improving the quality of life of residents and communities.

It is vital to promote a genuine digital culture in Italy in
order to take advantage of the many opportunities of
technological transition. This is the conviction on which

we have, through many initiatives associated with our
#GetDigital plan - from the Fastweb Digital Academy to
Fastweb4School and Digital IQ, the new self-assessment
test - continued to structure our commitment to this goal,
not only working on the fundamental digital skills for school
and jobs, but also explaining, through targeted initiatives for
young people, residents and families, what changes they
can expect in their lives and how to face them.
