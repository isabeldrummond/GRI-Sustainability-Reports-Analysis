THE ACCESS CODE TO YOUR DIGITAL SKILLS

 

THE PROJECT

Digital |Q is a targeted self-assessment tool launched in 2018 to assess digital skills and aptitude
in schools, people and companies. The purpose of the project is to provide schools, people

and companies with a tool for the simple and immediate identification of their strengths and
weaknesses in these areas

 

The test was designed by Fastweb and created with the scientific cooperation of the Sociology and Social
Research Department of Universita Bicocca in Milan and a team of psychologists and psychometrists from the
People&Business Value consulting firm

Digital 1Q is a scientific test focusing on soft skills and critical digital skills necessary for school and work,
intentionally excluding the assessment of technical and operational skills.

In particular, the following skill areas are considered

= Digital well-being: skills to direct Internet use towards achieving personal well-being and professional efficiency;

m Security: skills to safeguard against situations that could compromise security, such as data protection, digital
identity, the integrity of devices, economic protection and personal dignity;

= Creation of digital content: skills and aptitude for the creation and processing of online content enabling users to
become competent issuers and receivers;

= Communication and collaboration: skills and aptitude for proper communication with others in the digital world;

= Information: skills and aptitude for researching, selecting and evaluating online information considering sources,
making connections and classifying information.

At the end of the test, a personalized assessment is given, containing a map of the participant's digital skills and
aptitude, along with a digital badge that participants may attach to their CV or share or social media.

Theoretically, Digital 1Q is based on the most widely recognized digital competence frameworks, particularly
DigComp 2.0 defined by the European Commission. However, it differs from DigComp 2.0 in the Problem Solving

Macro Area, as Digital |Q has expanded it and renamed it “Digital Well-being”. Indeed, in addition to problem solving,

which is considered a transversal competence, Digital IQ includes questions to assess the individual skills and
aptitude necessary to reduce the main “collateral effects” of the digital world, like excessive use of the Internet and
the tendency to develop Internet habits that are counter-productive or dangerous to attention.

Two version of Digital |Q are offered: the first is a free version available online (www.digitaliq.it) for anyone
interested to take the test on their own and receive the Digital IQ badge, while the second version is for companies
and consists of a more comprehensive test that they can use to test their employees skills and gain a broad idea of
their training needs

Another version has been developed for middle and high schools thanks to the "Digital Well-being” project”.
