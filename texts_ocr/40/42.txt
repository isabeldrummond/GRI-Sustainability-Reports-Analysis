THE PROJECT

Fastweb Digital Academy (FDA) is the school providing training for digital professionals. It was
founded in 2016 as part of the Cariplo Factory through a partnership between Fastweb and
Fondazione Cariplo. FDA is based on three main pillars:

= Learning Digital: teaching and spreading the logic and skills necessary to use digital tools for
the creation of new products and services;

= Working Digital: contributing to the development of new digital skills to help people grow
professionally and make organizations more competitive;

a Acting Digital: promoting, through digital skills, aptitude and behavior to promote the growth
of innovation and culture in Italian society.

 

Designed for 18-year-olds and up, the Academy's courses are open and free to applicants who pass the

selection process. They cover four main disciplines: visual product and fashion design (Digital Design & Making),
programming techniques and languages (Digital Development), marketing and communications (Digital Marketing
& Communication) and general skills for the digital world (Digital Soft Skills). In addition, in 2018, a fifth area of
study was created for the development of specific digital skills for companies, SMEs and professionals (Digital for
Professionals & SMEs).

In 2018, the Academy began providing training outside Milan as well, reinforcing its presence in Palermo at the
Arca consortium and in Pescara in partnership with the Pescara section of Confindustria (Italian association of
manufacturing and service companies).

One crucial development in this direction was the start of FDA courses in Bari, with six training programs for
young people and SMEs: Digital Marketing and e-commerce for SMEs, Digital Marketing & Communication for B2B
and B2C companies, Digital Marketing Fundamentals, Social Media Marketing, Mobile Marketing and JavaScript
for Web Designers. The training sessions are held at Porta Futuro Bari, a last-generation job center, orientation

platform and hub bringing together job offers and job seel

p with the Bari municipal authorities, which will transform

 

Bari into an innovation hotbed of infrastructure and digita

services.

During the year, FDA also participated and sponsored many digital events and kicked off a series of partnerships.
In March, it took part in the first Milan Digital Week, offering a select group of residents an exclusive tour of one of
Fastweb's last-generation data centers and organizing workshops to promote new digital professions.

The Academy also participated in the #STEMintheCity 2018 marathon organized by the Milan municipal authorities
to promote the spread of science/tech studies (STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics)
and digital technologies among young people and, in particular, girls and young women.

In October, during DIGITALmeet 2018, FDA also held four workshops on digital marketing tools and strategies for

SMEs, digital apps for the beauty, sport and fashion industries, augmented reality and virtual reality for design and
personal branding. In partnership with the Milan Film Festival, Fastweb Digital Academy presented “Ultra Reality",

an area of the festival at the Base space in Milan devoted to “immersive content", i-e., virtual reality apps enabling

visitors to experience and explore the new frontiers of audio-visual content in a cinematic setting.

As part of the student work experience program, FDA kicked off “Digital Work Experience”, a project involving 100
students in their fourth year of high school, from nine different schools, who worked for a month on their skills and

expertise, with a focus on soft skills.

The initiative helped the students improve their awareness of their strengths and improvement areas, prepare for
