As required by the national labor agreement, all
Fastweb employees may take parental leave. In 2018,
296 employees took parental leave (218 women and 78
men), with 99% returning to work (in 2018, 293 people
returned to work) and a retention rate (i.e., workers

still with the company 12 months after having taken
parental leave) of 98%.°?

Again in 2018, Fastweb
renewed its partnership
with Valore D, one of

the most well-known
associations in Italy for its
commitment to promoting
diversity, talent and female leadership, offering training,
events and specific work groups formed by people
from its member companies specializing in different
areas. In 2018, 13 colleagues took Valore D training and
development courses.

As part of this partnership, 2018 saw the launch of
InspirinGirls, a campaign to increase girls' awareness
of their talent, liberating them from stereotypes of

all kinds. 39 volunteers from various sectors and
professions applied to be role models for this project

 

and in 2018, 15 of them were already sharing their
professional and life experiences with the participating
middle school students to create a bridge between
school and the world of employment. During the
meetings at schools, Fastweb's role models talked
about their personal and professional experiences,

to inspire and set an example for the girls, while also
motivating them to achieve their full potential.

Another important ongoing partnership was confirmed
again in 2018, Professional Women's Network (PWN), a
global network of professionals united in their common
goal of strengthening female leadership through
professional development and international networking.

The partnership with PWN led to two additional projects
during the year: Millennial Mentoring, to reduce the
digital divide between the different generations and
promote gender equality and Own your Career Program,
to bridge the gap between universities and schools,
encouraging female students poised to enter the job
market so they experience it as an exciting challenge,
including testimonials from women who have already
made this leap. In particular, Fastweb employees
provided two testimonials as part of this project in 2018.

32.Data on the number of people who took parental leave and the retention rate refer to January-November 2018.
