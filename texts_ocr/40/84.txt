6.1 MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

The growth of data traffic and the expansion of the
networks necessary sustain this growth have posed a
large number of challenges for the telecommunications
sector in terms of managing environmental impacts,
energy consumption and climate change.

Fastweb promotes the environmental sustainability of
its activities through programs aimed at reducing the
company's environmental impacts. The main areas on
which it focuses are increasing the energy efficiency

of its network infrastructure and data centers and
reducing the climate-changing emissions generated by
its activities and its customers’ use of services.

Significant attention is also paid to the adoption and
promotion of digital solutions as opportunities to
reduce the company's impact on the environment.

 
    

With the ISO 14001-certified environmental
management system, Fastweb has ensured
that it manages all the material environmental

impacts of its activities, striving for continuous
improvement.

 
     
   

To ensure that the environmental management
system's procedures are correctly applied, the company
conducts periodic internal audits and holds meetings
with the heads of the operating units that manage
environmental aspects.

In 2018, 28 internal audits were conducted on the
correct application of the environmental management
system within the company. These audits consisted

of checks on the application and effectiveness of
processes and inspections at offices, equipment rooms
and stores. All the findings and improvement areas
were addressed with the involvement of the operating
units concerned.
