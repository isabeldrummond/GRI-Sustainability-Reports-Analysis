2.3 FASTWEB'S IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY’S
SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

This year Fastweb conducted a survey with the
assistance of a consulting firm, EY, to analyze its
economic and social contribution to the country

in terms of jobs, GDP and tax revenue, using an
economic-statistical model based on input-output
tables and procurement data.

This analysis was performed to report more extensively
on the impacts of its activities, extending beyond the
direct impact to the consider creation of value along
its supply chain through the purchase of goods and
services for its business activities (indirect impact)
and the impact generated by the wealth distributed to
the economic system by direct and indirect employees

through spending for end consumption (induced impact).
