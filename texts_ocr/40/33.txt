The Fastweb network: how it works

The landline network connections essentially consist
of a cable linking the user's home or business

to the cabinet. In turn, the cabinet is connected

to a data traffic station. The type of connection
between the various network elements, which may
be via copper wires (DSL) or fiber, determine their
capacity in terms of connection speed.

Fiber optic cable, which can handle a higher band
of frequencies than copper, produces the best
digital data transmission capacity performance.
The connection type is defined by the type of
technologies and cables used.

FTTN (Fiber to the Node) refers to connections

in which fiber optics run from the station to the
cabinet, thereby retaining the copper wires only in
the last section from cabinet to the user's home
or business. Generally with this solution, the
copper section never exceeds 250 meters and,
therefore, does not significantly impact the signal
transmission speed.

FTTH (Fiber to the Home) refers to all connections
in which fiber optics cover the entire line from the
station to the user's home or business.

GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) is a recently
developed and even more recently implemented
FTTH technology, aimed at optimizing network
infrastructure and offering users avant-garde
connection speeds (up to 1 Gbps).

Again this year, the company remained highly focused
on Internet network access technologies to provide
its customers with service quality in line with the best
market standards in terms of Internet connection and
voice speed, performance, reliability and continuity. In
2018, the technological upgrade involved roughly 300
thousand customers, who were able to make use of
the best access technology available in their homes
or offices (74 thousand via optical fiber). Thanks to
this plan, at the end of 2018, 8 million homes and
businesses are active on Fastweb's ultra-broadband
infrastructure.

In addition to working to improve the coverage ensured
by its network infrastructure, Fastweb has expanded
the coverage of its connection services through VULA
(Virtual Unbundling Line Access) and Bitstream NGA
(New Generation Access) infrastructure.

With these types of ultra-broadband connection,
other operators provide Fastweb with certain sections
of the network between the central station and end
user. Thanks to this new infrastructure, Fastweb

now reaches roughly 14 million homes/businesses,

in addition to the 8 million with access from the
proprietary infrastructure, for total coverage of over 22
million of homes/businesses.

Finally, during the year, Fastweb has invested in the
completion of the FON network, with a transmission
grid covering roughly 7,500 km throughout the country.
The new infrastructure, established in 2017 through

a partnership with Huawei, is the first fully resilient
network capable of ensuring service continuity in the
event of temporary interruptions. The high degree

of flexibility, in terms of resilience, scalability and
simplification for both the network itself and service
provision processes, and the high degree of security
make the FON network ideal for the transmission of
Fastweb's Backbone IP and high-capacity international
connectivity services between Europe, the Middle East,
Asia and Africa transiting through Sicily. Furthermore,
the FON network is also open to high-capacity
Enterprise connectivity and other types of services.
