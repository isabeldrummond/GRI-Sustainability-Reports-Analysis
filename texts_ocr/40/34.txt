FON, the Flexible Optical Network, is a transport
network created using fully resilient WOM
(Wavelength Division Multiplexing) and OTN (Optical
Transport Network) photonic technologies capable
of ensuring service continuity through the ASON
(Automatically Switched Optical Network) which
offers users different service levels and high-speed
connections through the flexible and automatic
re-routing of data traffic in the event of temporary
interruptions. This recently developed infrastructure
can multiply the transmission capacity of a single
optical fiber by 80 times, activate optical transport
at 200 Gb per second and reaching distances of
over 2,500 km with optical transmission of 100Gb
per second.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR CONVERGENCE
AND DIGITALIZATION

“Everywhere, everything, everyone" is the formula that in
recent years has reflected the company's commitment
to ensuring increasingly convergent services for simple,
immediate and fast Internet access anywhere and to
meet any need.

To Fastweb, convergence means offering the best
available technology - whether on the fixed, mobile or
wi-fi network - regardless of where users are and what
Internet functions they use, and improving customers’
connection experience, at a time when demand for online
content is continuously growing.

We work every day to improve customers ,
connection experience to meet increa

 

demand to use online content.

 

During the year, the company has decided to invest

in a number of different activities in order to fulfil its
commitment: from consolidating its presence on the
mobile segment of the market, to extending open wi-fi
solutions in urban centers and the WOW FI service, up
to the increasingly numerous 5G tests launched, 5G
being a technology that could alone revolutionize the
world in which we live, produce and work.

In the mobile world, Fastweb is a Full Mobile Virtual
Network Operator (Full MVNO), providing its customers
with quality, wide network coverage (roughly 98% of the
Italian population) and access to last-generation 4G
and 4G Plus mobile services.

WOW FI: ITALY'S LARGEST WI-FI
NETWORK

During the year, many investments have related to
WOW FI, the free open wi-fi service available to Fastweb
customers. The company has increased the number of
hotspots in major Italian cities, reaching a total of 1,400
hotspots. Customers also appreciate the quality of this
service and continue to confirm their participation in
the network, doubling the number of users from 2017 to
2018. This has made it possible for Fastweb to expand
WOW FI coverage, extending it to all the cities in which
Fastweb offers its services, from metropolitan areas to
small towns, bringing the number of homespots to 1.8
million.

The project has also entailed partnerships with public
and private players with which it has signed protocols
of understanding giving Fastweb the chance to improve
WOW FI coverage, and protocol signatories the chance
to share, in the areas and spaces covered by the
agreement, a free, public high-quality wi-fi service with
residents or users.

WOW F1is now the largest wi-fi network in Italy:
coverage has increasingly expanded over time,

In this context, Fastweb has, for example, begun
testing services with ATM (Azienda Trasporti
Milanesi) entailing the installation of wi-fi hotspots

on the platforms and levels of the Milanese metro
stops Duomo, San Babila and Cadorna, where, since
February, a wi-fi service is available at no charge to
Fastweb customers who subscribe to the WOW FI
service and transport passengers who have logged on
to the network.

Given the success of this project, Fastweb's next
objective is to expand the wireless network to all
stations on the metro line and to begin testing on bus
and tram routes as well.

Similarly, Fastweb has signed three new protocols of
understanding with: the Lecce municipal authorities,
AMTAB (the public transport company in Bari) and the
Rome library service. Finally, Fastweb, has participated
in the cabling - via Symbiosis wi-fi hotspots - of the
new smart district that will house the company's new
headquarters beginning in 2019, providing free wi-fi
access to users from the new Piazza Olivetti as well.
