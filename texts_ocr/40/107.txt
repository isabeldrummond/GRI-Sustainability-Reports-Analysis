Not applicable

These are not material for
Fastweb, as its NOx and SOx
emissions are due to its car
fleet.

Data on new hires and resignations/
dismissals are not specified by “region” as
this breakdown would be immaterial (the
data refer exclusively to Italian employees).

There are no differences between the benefits
provided to full-time employees and those
with part-time contracts. The differences
between the benefits provided to permanent
employees and those with fixed-term
contracts consist of insurance policies, which
are only offered to permanent employees.
The company health plan is only offered to
workers with minimum 12-month contracts.
