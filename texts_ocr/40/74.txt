In particular, by upholding the principles of “Build the
least possible”, “multi-functional spaces” and “no
assigned seats", open spaces have been designed
to encourage this new way of working. The lack of
closed-off offices and static desks will be offset
by various types of conference rooms, co-working
spaces and functional areas where personnel can
meet, work together or take a break, based on

the concept of everyone choosing where to work
depending on what they need to do and who they
need to do it with.

In this way, the building should instill new modes
of conduct, leading to workers assuming more
responsibility for their needs and the promotion of
widespread cooperation.

New technologies are a key part of this approach: the
new space will be the first Fastweb offices with an all
wi-fi primary network, equipped with new cloud and
digital communication solutions for people to work, as
needed, either remotely or from any of the many spaces
provided in the offices easily, collaboratively and rapidly.

Specific attention has been devoted to the creation of
a paperless office (digitalization of records) and the
adoption of green building practices, as demonstrated
by the building's LEED Platinum certification. The

new offices will also have a solar power system to
self-generate electricity and a last-generation air
conditioning system to reduce energy consumption.

In addition, the project has preserved the grassy areas
pre-dating the construction of the building, keeping
the gardens opposite piazza Olivetti, with over 100
types of plants and trees typical of the area. The
building was also designed considering sustainable
practices for transport, with the provision of nearby
parking for car and bike sharing. In line with the
Sharing Cities project, of which the Symbiosis district
is part, the use of public transport and sustainable
lifestyle choices will be strongly encouraged.

 

The transversal approach to employee involvement
and the widespread use of innovative digital solutions
for everyday work have made Fastweb an example
for many companies that are now, for the first time,
attempting digitalization and employee engagement.

74 Work and inclusion

As for the Bari offices, which were completed in
2017, Fastweb employees took an active part in
the design of the Milan offices by responding to
targeted surveys, participating in specific meetings
and department interviews and by visiting the
construction site. One important example of this
involvement is the series of six employee co-
design workshops, in which 60 workers acted as
spokespeople for their colleagues, reporting the
needs and expectations of the various company
departments to the architect responsible for the
building and to the relevant company divisions.

Furthermore, four online surveys for the entire
company population asked for their opinion on
issues like mobility to and from the offices, what
functions to include in the Fastweb app, and

how to manage mobility and meals. To promote
participation, the first layer of managers were
actively involved in the construction project with
visits to the site. Over 100 managers provided
feedback and acted as promoters and ambassadors
with other employees on the main new elements
of the building. Furthermore, in preparation of the
move, the entire population that will be affected by
it was offered a chance to tour the new offices, and
over 270 people took the tour.

Co-design sessions with over 40 people were also
held to define the new app on Agora, the company's
Intranet. The app will replace the current mobile
Intranet and enable employees to reserve their work
spaces online and access the main functions and
news published on Agora.

All the aspects that arose during the listening

and discussions with employees were analyzed

and examined. This led to the definition of new
requirements in the spaces, initiatives to improve
shared outdoor spaces, the drafting of “newtiquette”
a code of conduct for all employees working in the
new space.

In 2018, two learning tours were held with top
companies in the luxury and financial sectors. A
handful of meetings were held with management to
explore these issues and learn about their companies’
experiences.
