During the year Fastweb continued to develop 5G, the
new connectivity solution that combines the flexibility
of a mobile network with the connection speed of a
landline network, increasingly effacing the line between
these two different technologies.

Our goal is to be a 5G leader in Italy, thereby ,
becoming the country's top landline/mobile

convergence operator.

 

In line with this strategy, in July, the company
strengthened its strategic partnership with Tiscali
through an agreement giving Fastweb long-term
access to a portion of the spectrum in 3.5 GHz band.
This reinforces its fixed-mobile convergence strategy
and enables it to rapidly build a 5G network starting in
major Italian cities.

As part of the auction for 5G frequencies, which was
held after the Ministry of Economic Development
published its call for bids and related regulation and
was concluded in October 2018, Fastweb also won a
package of frequencies in the 26 GHz band.

In September 2018, when the first 5G standard
antenna was turned on, the “Bari Matera 5G: together
for a Digital Future" project, kicked off in 2017 with
TIM and Huawei as part of the Ministry of Economic
Development's call for bids named “5 cities for 5G",
entered its second stage, i.e., the operating stage,
moving from laboratory studies to reality with the first
on-site inspections.

This project has entailed continued testing on various 5G
applications, with a specific focus on Health 5.0, Industry
4.0, environmental monitoring and port security.
