4.1 #NIENTECOMEPRIMA: “LIKE NOTHING BEFORE” - MEANING
TRANSPARENT AND SIMPLE OFFERS AND SERVICES

“#nientecomeprima’, which is Italian for Like nothing
before, is the formula that Fastweb has chosen to promote
the radical change in the fixed and mobile telephony
market, with an increasingly convergent approach based on
transparency, simplicity and consumer freedom.

Mainly pursued by the Consumer segment up until now,
this strategy was launched in 2017 and consolidated
throughout 2018, as the company continues to
manage prices transparently and is now extending its

commitment to transparency to service quality and,

in general, to relationships with customers in order to
revolutionize the way in which the company and users
interact, based on trust and listening to feedback.

 
  

  

Through “#nientecomeprima” our company
continues to promote and strengthen a new way
of interacting with users based on trust and

listening to feedback.

 
   
   
 

 

#nientecomeprima

Fastweb is revolutionizing the telecommunications market with a series of unique landline and mobile initiatives,
leading to increasingly more transparency on a market filled with deals and hidden charges.

The initiatives rolled out in 2017 were confirmed in
2018 and will continue in the years to come.

For mobile telephone service customers, “Start”, the
first initiative, eliminates extra service costs (e.g., voice
mail, automatic call-back, credit balance checks),

call connection fees and contract term restrictions

and allows users to use their traffic minutes in 60
international destinations and connect to the WOW FI
network for mobile internet without using up the data
traffic Gigabytes in their package.

“Change” confirms the company's commitment to
eliminating all extra costs in customers’ bills for the sake
of simplicity and transparency. This commitment can
be summed up in the slogan “What you see is what you
pay" and gives current customers access to new offers,
with the same benefits that new customers enjoy.

 

The initiatives rolled out in 2018 began with “Try”, in
which Fastweb introduced the “Fastweb Mobile Trial”,
whereby customers can try out Fastweb's mobile
service for free, without any restrictions or fines.

They can request and enable their SIM card using the
MyFastweb app or on the company's website: the first
month of service is free, after which customers may
decide whether to renew the service or not.

“Trust” has eliminated additional costs for high-speed
connection options and introduced billing by calendar
month, making bills easier to read. This is the first fixed
network offer with a flat rate in the bill that includes

all activation and related costs, plus the FASTGate
modem and guarantees the fastest speed available. In
addition, it eliminates all contract term restrictions for
fixed network customers, letting them decide when to
terminate their contracts with Fastweb.

We are the only player on the Italian market

with no restrictions for fixed or mobile
telephony customers.

 

“More" gives fixed network customers the chance to ask
to switch to fiber as soon as it is available, without any

additional charge, and all they need to do is request the
switch on the MyFASTPage or using the MyFastweb app.

With the sixth initiative in this strategy, “Speed”,
Fastweb became the only Italian player to tell
customers the exact speed of their home connection
transparently and directly in their contract. Moreover,
after the line is activated, an operator calls each
customer to check that the speed coincides with

that indicated in the contract. If it is slower, the
customer may withdraw from the contract without any
