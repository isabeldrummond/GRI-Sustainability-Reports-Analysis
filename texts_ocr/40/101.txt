ASSURANCE STATEMENT ADDRESSED

TO FASTWEB STAKEHOLDERS

1. INTRODUCTION

Fastweb S.p.A. (Fastweb") has commissioned Bureau
Veritas Italia S.p.A. (Bureau Veritas") an independent
assurance of its 2018 Sustainability Report (“Report”), for
the purpose of providing findings over:

m the accuracy and quality of published information
concerning its sustainability performance;

m the correct application of those reporting principles
outlined in the Report's methodology, in particular
Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting
Standards (GRI Standards).

2. RESPONSIBILITY, METHODOLOGY
AND LIMITATIONS

Fastweb alone had the responsibility of collecting,
analyzing, collating and presenting information and
data included in its Report. Bureau Veritas responsibility
has been to perform an independent assurance against
defined objectives and to reach the conclusions
reported in this Statement.

The assurance performed has been a Limited Assurance

in accordance to the ISAE 3000 standard, through

sample application of audit techniques, including:

m review of Fastweb's policy, mission, values,
commitments;

g review of records, data, procedures and information-
gathering systems;

g interviews to members of the working group
responsible for drafting the Report;

m interviews to company representatives from various
functions and levels, including top management;

g overall verification of information and general content
of the 2018 Sustainability Report.

The assurance activities have been performed at the at the
company offices in Via Caracciolo and Viale Fulvio Testi
(Milan - Italy), and we believe we have obtained sufficient
and adequate evidence to support our conclusions.

The assurance has covered the whole 2018
Sustainability Report, with the following limitations: for
economic and financial information, Bureau Veritas
only verified their consistency with the company's
annual report and accounts; for activities outside the
reference period (1 January 2018 — 31 December
2018) and for statements of policy, intent and objective,
Bureau Veritas verified their consistency against the
outlined reporting methodology. Furthermore, it was
not possible to review the impact assessment in
section 2.3 “The impact of FASTWEB on the socio-
economic development of the country", due to the use
of calculation parameters protected by copyright.

3. CONCLUSIONS

Following the assurance activities described above,
nothing has come to our attention to indicate that
information and data in the Report are inaccurate,
incorrect or unreliable. In our opinion, the Report
provides a trustworthy representation of Fastweb
activities conducted by during the year 2018 and of
main results achieved.

Information is reported generally in a clear,
comprehensible and balanced manner.

In the illustration of activities and results, in particular,
FASTWEB has paid attention to adopt a neutral
language, avoiding as far as possible the self-
referentiality.

With regards to the reporting methodology

outlined by the organization in its Report, it is our
opinion that principles from the GRI Standards
(Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Sustainability Context,
Materiality, Completeness, Accuracy, Balance, Clarity,
Comparability, Reliability, Timelines) were duly
implemented. Based on our assurance activities, a
“Comprehensive" level of implementation has been
achieved. We also confirm that our activities met the
GRI requirements for external assurance.
