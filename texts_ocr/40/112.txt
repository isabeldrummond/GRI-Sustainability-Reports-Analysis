7.4 GLOSSARY

Broadband services Services provided with a
transmission speed of at least 2 Mbit/s. According to
international standards, these services are broken down
into two categories:

= Interactive services, including video-phoning/
video-conferencing (point-to-point and multipoint),
video- monitoring, interconnection of local networks;
file transfer, CAD, high-speed fax transfer, e-mail with
moving images or shared documents, broadband
video- text, on-demand videos, recovery of audio
programs or of fixed and moving images;

= Broadband services, such as audio programs,
television programs (including high-resolution TV and
pay-TV) and selective acquisition of documents.

Ultra-fast broadband

The term “broadband” refers to a transmission scheme
where multiple signals share the bandwidth of a single
medium (usually fiber optics, more rarely over the

air or metal cable), allowing more information to be
transmitted simultaneously and more rapidly. Ultra-fast
broadband is the term used when the transmission
speed exceeds 30 Mbps.

Direct energy consumption

Consumption of primary energy sources (natural

gas, fuel, etc.) in areas that the organization owns or
controls. An example of this is the consumption of
natural gas to operate heating systems installed in the
organization's facilities.

Indirect energy consumption

Consumption of primary energy sources (coal, natural
gas, fossil fuels etc.) in areas that the organization
does not own or control. An example of this is the
consumption of electricity purchased from a supplier
company, which uses primary energy sources in its
own facilities in order to generate electricity.

Digital

This is a mode of representing a physical variable with
a language that uses only the digits 0 and 1. The digits
are transmitted in binary form as a series of pulses.

112 Additional information

Digital networks are rapidly replacing the outdated
analogue networks; they enable increased capacity
and more flexibility through the use of computer-based
technology for transmitting and handling calls. Digital
systems offer less noise interference and can also
incorporate encryption as security against external
interference.

Direct emissions

Emissions generated by sources that the organization
owns or controls (e.g. emissions from mobility and
office heating).

Indirect emissions

Emissions that are the result of the organization's
activities, but that are generated by sources owned
or controlled by other organizations (e.g. emissions
originating from the generation of energy consumed).

Fiber optics

Thin strands (fiber) of glass or plastic forming the
infrastructure base for data transmission. A fiber

cable contains a number of individual fibers, each

one of which can transmit the signal (light waves) at

a practically unlimited bandwidth. They are mainly
used for long-distance transmissions to transfer large
amounts of data, because signals are protected from
interference along their path. Fiber optic cables can
carry a lot more data than traditional cables and copper
wires. They come in the form of flexible cables and are
immune to electrical interference as well as extreme
weather conditions and are resistant to changes in
temperature. The cladding is usually 125 micrometers
in diameter (about the diameter of a strand of human
hair) and the cables are extremely light: one kilometer
of optical fiber weighs less than 2 kg, not including

the protective sheath. Fiber optics are classified as
dielectric waveguides. In other words, they can transfer
and conduct an electromagnetic field of sufficiently
high frequency (in general, close to infrared) with
extremely limited loss. They are commonly used in
telecommunications to transmit optic signals also over
long distances, on transport network, and in the supply
of cabled broadband access (from 100 Mbit/s to Tbit/s
using the most refined WDM technologies.
