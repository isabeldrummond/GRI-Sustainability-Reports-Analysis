6.3 MONITORING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
AN ONGOING COMMITMENT

Since 2015, Fastweb has monitored
its greenhouse gas emissions by
calculating its carbon footprint. Using
this methodology, the company can
record its greenhouse gas emissions
each year according to international guidelines, i-e.,
the “Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard" of
the Global Greenhouse Gas Protocol (the international
standard for climate-changing emission monitoring)
and the “Pilot Testing on Methodologies for Ener
Consumption and Carbon Footprint for ICT-sector"
developed by the European Commission.

The survey showed that Fastweb's emissions increased
by roughly 39% from 2017 to 2018. This was mainly

franchised stores, the supply chain, distribution and
retrieval of equipment, customers’ use of services and
product end-of-life*’, assessing:

1. Direct emissions due to Fastweb's and its subsidiaries’
activities (such as the use of fuel for heating/cooling
and use of company cars and car sharing) - Scope 1;

2. Indirect emissions due to the acquisition of
electricity - Scope 2;

3. Other indirect emissions arising from company
activities but from greenhouse gas sources that
are not proprietary or are controlled by another
organization - Scope 3.

due to the sharp growth in the acquisition of optical
fiber, which, although it is necessary to expand the
network and digitalize the country, generates an impact
in terms of greater emissions in production.

A detailed analysis of the individual contributions
reveals that direct emissions (Scope 1) increased from
4,877 tons of CO, equivalents to 4,943 tons of CO,
equivalents, with a slight increase in fuel consumption
for the use of company cars and car sharing.

In 2017, Fastweb changed its calculation methodology
for Scope 2 emissions to align with the parent company
Swisscom's*: the value of Scope 2 emissions was zero
in both 2017 and 2018, since 100% of the electricity
that the company acquires directly is produced by
renewable sources. Scope 2 emissions would still be
calculated as zero applying the same calculation model
to the consumption recorded in 2016.

If Fastweb had acquired electricity from non-renewable
sources, its emissions from energy consumption

35.The map of impacts excludes multi-brand stores only, and their contribution is, in any case, negligible,
36. Electricity consumption not acquired directly but through the lease of spaces was considered within Scope 3 emissions
