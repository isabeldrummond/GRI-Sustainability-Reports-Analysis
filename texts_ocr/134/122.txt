The Italian group companies have introduced remote work for their office staff and have reviewed their travel
policies to limit travel. In line with the specific risks at the Italian and foreign work sites, preventative measures
have been introduced to reduce the risk of spreading the virus in the work place, the residences and canteens.
This has involved the reorganisation of work spaces and shifts to ensure the safety distance can be maintained,
the supply of additional personal safety devices (e.g., masks, gloves, etc.), intensified sanitising and disinfection
activities, special information and training courses, more healthcare services at the work sites and the
preparation of special areas for the isolation of workers with flu-like symptoms who have returned from areas at
risk or who have been in contact with people who may have the virus. The Group has also prepared dedicated

methods to liaise with the local authorities to treat any suspected cases.
