On 17 March 2020, Decree law no. 18/2020 (the “Marzo Cura Italia” decree) was issued whereby the

government earmarked €25 billion to stem the immediate effects of the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19).

Another Decree law should be issued in April to relaunch the economy by injecting liquidity of some tens of
billions of Euros. The infrastructure sector should be one of those that will benefit from this measure.

The project for the construction of the Giovi third railway crossing of the high speed/capacity Milan - Genoa

  

High-speed/capacity Milan - Genoa Railway Project (COCIV)

railway line section was assigned to the COCIV consortium as general contractor by Rete Ferroviaria Italia
S.p.A. (RFI, formerly TAV S.p.A. - as Ferrovie dello Stato’s operator) with the agreement of 16 March 1992 and

subsequent rider of 11 November 2011.

Salini Impregilo has a 99.999% stake in the consortium as its leader. Its stake changed during the year after
Condotte’s interest therein was decreased to the minimum as described in detail in the notes to the consolidated

and separate financial statements.
The works began on 2 April 2012 and the contract is worth approximately €4.7 billion.

It is split into six non-functional construction lots for a total of roughly 125 months excluding the pre-

operating/inspection phase (three months).

On 18 June 2019, RFI informed the consortium that, following enactment of Law no. 55 of 14 June 2019
containing urgent measures to relaunch the public works sector, the conditions established by the RFI-COCIV
rider had been met. This rider provided for the contract to be drawn up for the sixth and last construction lot
worth approximately €528 million and, accordingly, it was formalised. In October 2019, the consortium received

the contract advance of roughly €53 million.

As provided for contractually, the contracts for the two Pozzolo - Tortona and Voltri - Polcevera lots were

formalised during the year for €425 million as per the costs estimated in the tender bids.

At 31 December 2019, all the six lots provided for in the rider of 11 November 2011 were fully financed for €4.4

billion.

The call for tenders for the last lots to be assigned will start up again in 2020.
