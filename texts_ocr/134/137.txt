In the medium to long term, changes in the annual average rainfall levels are expected in many areas around
the world, which could potentially affect the outlook of sectors like the non-pumped storage hydropower sector.
The analyses available that have been prepared using probable scenarios include potential reductions in rainfall
in certain areas and the concurrent increase in other areas. As a result, investments allocated to these areas
could change (either increasing or decreasing) with the related follow-on effects on business. It can be expected
that these changes will be gradual, monitored and that any mitigation action necessary will take place using the
current strategic and commercial planning tools assisted by the Group’s international presence and market

diversification.
