On 17 January 2020, Salini Impregilo announced the final results of its invitation to the holders of the outstanding
notes “€600,000,000 3.75 per cent. Notes due 24 June 2021” (ISIN: XS1435297202) (the “2021 notes”) to
exchange their 2021 notes for Euro-dominated senior fixed rate notes to be issued by the parent (the “new

notes”) (the “exchange offer”) and their conditions.
The average nominal amount of the 2021 notes validly offered for exchange is €120,970,000.

COVID-19 pandemic

The Group is closely analysing and monitoring the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to: (i) changes
in its reference context and the measures adopted in the countries where it operates; (ii) relations with clients
and partners; (iii) impacts on its projects due to the changed availability of internal and external resources and/or
other circumstances and events directly or indirectly related to the pandemic; (iv) triggering of specific contract

clauses; and (v) service performance levels and continuity by suppliers, subcontractors and partners.

Accordingly, it has set up a crisis unit which assesses the situation daily to define and adapt processes for the

prevention and containment of any critical situations at the work sites.

The Group has introduced a series of measures at all organisational levels in its head office, abroad and in the
work sites to safeguard the health and safety of its employees and consultants in compliance with the guidance
provided by the authorities of the various countries. It will guarantee the continuity of its activities, as far as

possible, to build those works that are strategic and essential for the community and its clients.
