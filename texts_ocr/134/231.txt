3. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
USW Campania

At 31 December 2019 and as already noted in previous years, the Group decided that the conditions for
application of IFRS 5 - Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations continued to exist for the
USW Campania projects. Therefore, it has recognised the USW Campania project net assets and operations

separately in the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss.

Due to reasons outside the Group’s control, the period for completion of the sale has extended beyond the year
allowed by IFRS 5. Despite this, the Group’s commitment to finalising the sale remains unchanged. Therefore,
the directors have not deemed it necessary to change the accounting treatment of the assets in question as
provided for in IFRS 5.9.

Reference should be made to the section on the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” in the Directors’ report for

more information.
CONSORCIO AGUA AZUL S.A.

At the reporting date, the Group reclassified the investment in Consorcio Agua Azul S.A., held by Impregilo
International Infrastructures N.V., to assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. On 7 January 2020, it was

sold with the recognition of a gain of roughly €5 million.

Consolidated financial statements

The Group opted to present its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 in line with previous

years as follows:

e Current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities are presented separately in the
statement of financial position. Current assets and liabilities are those expected to be realised, sold,
used or settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle, which usually exceeds 12 months. Non-current
assets and liabilities include non-current assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefits, deferred tax
liabilities and other balances expected to be realised, sold, used or settled after the Group’s normal

operating cycle, i.e., more than twelve months after the reporting date.
