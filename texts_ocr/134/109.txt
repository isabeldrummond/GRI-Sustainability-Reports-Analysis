New hires and outgoing employee trends are affected by the unique nature of the infrastructure sector, where
workers are taken on for specific projects with employment contracts that usually end when the works have been

completed.

In 2019, the Group hired 6,247 resources, including 2,448 under 30 years old. Outgoing employees numbered
12,501 and this figure includes the transfers of resources among group sites. The greatest number of departures
was seen in the Middle East as a result of the advanced stage of completion on the main ongoing projects.

Voluntary departures made up 10% of the total.

Employer Branding

The Group continued its multi-year Employee Branding activities during the year, focusing on the attraction and
selection of young people and the provision of professional counselling and tutoring about construction sector
career opportunities. This involves strategic agreements with universities, engagement initiatives such as career
days, recruiting days, themed workshops in university faculties, presentations and visits to construction sites,
with a focus on communications via digital and social media, university websites and the main on-line job boards,

as these allow direct and ongoing contact with potential candidates.

Among the strategic agreements with universities, the Company stepped up its collaboration with the Australian
universities. It continued to partner the University of Technology (UTS) in Sydney to fund a scholarship for
deserving engineering students (the “Salini Impregilo Tomorrow’s Builders scholarship”) and started a university
programme to promote the academic and professional training of female engineers. This wide-ranging
collaboration, covered by an agreement signed in 2018, was extended to other projects in 2019 including the
design of a joint short-course in Tunnelling, to be held in Spring 2020, and the identification of joint research

projects.

The Group also commenced talks with the main universities of Melbourne to assess future developments and
collaborations. To this end, it participated in the “STEM Internship” career fair organised by RMIT University.

In the US, Lane’s employer branding plan extended to the main colleges and universities of the states where
the Group operates, such as University of Florida and University of Washington State, mainly in the form of

participation at career fairs and recruitment days.

In Europe, the Group participated in the Career Forum of the Ecole Spéciale des Travaux Publics (ESTP) in
Paris which attracts thousands of engineering students for the second consecutive year. The school, which is
also called “Ecole Des Grand Projets” is one of the leading French institutes for training in the construction

sector.

At home, Salini Impregilo increased its collaboration with Genoa University, rolling out a number of activities

during the year for the training, orientation and recruitment of university students. This included the learning
