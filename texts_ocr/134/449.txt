in order to protect the savings shareholders’ rights in the case the shares have a nominal amount, the above
fixed amount is adjusted accordingly.

Profit for the year as per the separate financial statements is allocated as follows:
a) 5% to the legal reserve, up to the legally-required amount;

b) to savings shares, to the extent of 5% of €5.2 per share (i.e., €0.26 per share). If a dividend lower than
5% of €5.2 per share (i.e., €0.26 per share) is paid one year, the difference is taken as an increase in

the preferred dividend of the following two years;

c) the residual amount, to all shareholders in such a way as to allocate to savings shares a total dividend
which is 2% of €5.2 per share (i.e., €0.104 per share) greater than that distributed to ordinary shares,
except when the shareholders decide to allocate an amount to the extraordinary reserves or for other

uses.
