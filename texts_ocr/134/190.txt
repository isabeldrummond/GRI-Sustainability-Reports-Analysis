COCIV Consortium

With the claim form notified to the COCIV consortium (“COCIV”) on 18 September 2014, the customer RFI

Strait of Messina bridge - Eurolink

In March 2006, as lead contractor of the joint venture created for this project (interest of 45%) (subsequently
merged into the SPE Eurolink S.C.p.A., “Eurolink”), Impregilo signed a contract with Stretto di Messina S.p.A.
(“SDM”) for its engagement as general contractor for the final and executive designs and construction of the

Strait of Messina Bridge and related roadway and railway connectors.

A bank syndicate also signed the financial documentation required in the General Specifications after the joint
venture won the tender, for the concession of credit lines of €250 million earmarked for this project (subsequently
decreased to €20 million in 2010). The customer was also given performance bonds of €239 million, as provided

for in the contract.

SDM and Eurolink signed a rider in September 2009 which covered, inter alia, suspension of the project works
carried out since the contract was signed and until that date. As provided for by the rider, the final designs were

delivered to the customer and its board of directors approved them on 29 July 2011.

Decree law no. 187 was issued on 2 November 2012 providing for “Urgent measures for the renegotiation of the
contracts with Stretto di Messina S.p.A. (the customer) and for local public transport”. Following enactment of
this decree and given the potential implications for its position, Eurolink, led by Salini Impregilo, notified the
customer of its intention to withdraw from the contract under the contractual terms, also to protect the positions
of all the Italian and foreign co-venturers. However, given the immense interest in constructing the works,
Eurolink also communicated its willingness to review its position should the customer demonstrate its real
intention to carry out the project. To date, the ongoing negotiations have not been successful despite the efforts
made. Eurolink has commenced various legal proceedings in Italy and the EU, arguing that the provisions of the
above decree are contrary to the Constitution and EU treaties and that they damage Eurolink’s legally acquired
rights under the contract. It has also requested that SDM be ordered to pay the amounts requested due to the
termination of the contract for reasons not attributable to it. With regard to the actions filed at EU level, in
November 2013, the European Commission communicated its decision not to follow up the proceedings, as no

treaties were violated, and confirmed this on 7 January 2014, with a communication dismissing the case. As
