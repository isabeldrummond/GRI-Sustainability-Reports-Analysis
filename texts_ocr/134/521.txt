Measurement of contract assets and liabilities
Notes to the separate financial statements: notes 3 “Basis of presentation”, 11

“Contract assets and liabilities”, 28 and
29 “Revenue”
Key audit matter Audit procedures addressing the key
audit matter
‘The separate financial statements at 31 Our audit procedures included:
December 2019 include contract assets of — understanding the process for the

1,230.1 million, contract liabilities of €544.2
million and revenue for works invoiced to
customers of €2,476.1 million recognised
using the percentage of completion method

based on the cost to cost model.

Measuring contract assets and liabilities is
based on significant estimates about the total
contract revenue and costs and the related

complexity;

— the risk profile of certain countries in

which the work is carried out.

For the above reasons, we believe that the

measurement of contract assets and
liabilities is a key audit matter.
