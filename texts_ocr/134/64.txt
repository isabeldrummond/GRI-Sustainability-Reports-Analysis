macroeconomic and socio-political dynamics, global megatrends (climate change, resource scarcity and
urbanisation), sector trends and competitive scenario, as well as from industry-specific technological innovation

and regulatory developments and the projects’ long-term nature.

Given the nature of such risks, the Group must rely on its forecasting and managing abilities. Specifically, Salini
Impregilo integrates risk vision in its strategic and business planning processes through the definition of
commercial and risk guidelines and the development of a process for the prioritisation and selection of initiatives
to be pursued, also and above all based on the assessment of relevant risks linked to the country and/or sector
in which operations are planned, rather than to the counterparty. Risk control is also ensured by monitoring the
progress of strategic objectives, including in terms of composition and diversification of the portfolio and its

development over time in terms of risk profile.
Strategic risks

These risks arise from strategic, business and organisational decisions that may adversely impact the Group’s
performance and ultimately result in the non-achievement of strategic objectives. They include risks resulting
from the choice of business or organisational models through which the Group intends to operate, those arising
from M&A transactions, or the ineffective management of the order portfolio or the relationships with key

counterparties (clients, partners, suppliers, sub-contractors, etc.).

Salini Impregilo considers risk a key element for the preliminary assessment of decisions and strategic choices,
so much so that it provided for integration of the strategy definition and development process with that for the
identification, measurement and management of risks. The choices pertaining to the adoption of a business or
organisational model, the assessment about the opportunity of proceeding with an extraordinary transaction or
establishing a partnership are subject to preliminary analysis and evaluation of the related risks and
opportunities, with the concurrent identification of risk management methods and strategies to be promptly

activated should such risks arise.
Financial risks

Risks linked to the availability of group resources, depending on the management of receivables and cash and
cash equivalents and/or the volatility of market variables such as interest and exchange rates, are included in

this category.

Specifically, liquidity management has the objective of ensuring the financial autonomy of contracts in progress,
taking into account the structure of consortia and special purpose entities, which can tie the availability of
financial resources to the execution of the relevant projects. Moreover, liquidity management takes into account

restrictions to currency transfers imposed by the legislation of some countries.

Salini Impregilo also considers specific risk areas such as the counterparty’s credit rating, raw materials price

volatility and management of assurance issues, equipping itself with effective financial planning tools.
Legal and compliance risk

This risk class includes risks for the management of legal issues and/or risks related to compliance with laws
and regulations (e.g. taxation, local legislation, etc.) required in order to operate in the sector and/or specific
countries and the risks arising from the management of contracts with business partners. Salini Impregilo deems

that monitoring contractual issues linked to contract management and, particularly, the relationship with relevant
