The classification of Salini Impregilo Group companies in line with the IFRS referred to earlier was based on

the following guidelines:

(i) Paragraphs 5 and 6 of IFRS 10 were adhered to for assessing the existence of control. Group entities
were only classified as subsidiaries when the Group has substantial rights over the investee’s relevant
activities, in exchange for the Group’s exposure to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
and the Group can use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the variable returns. These
requirements are met when the Group holds sufficient voting rights to obtain the majority required in

decisions for the governance bodies of the group entities in question.

(ii) | Reference was made to paragraphs 4 and 5 of IFRS 11 to assess the existence of joint control. Joint
control exists if the majorities required for decision-taking by the governance bodies of the group entities
in question require the unanimous vote or qualified majorities that can only be reached with the consent

of a specific group of investors.

(iii) | With reference to the type of joint arrangements, in view of the fact that all joint arrangements in which
the Group participates are structured through separate vehicles, reference was made to paragraph B15
of IFRS 11, analysing in particular the legal form of the separate vehicle and the terms of the contractual
agreement. With reference to the situation at 31 December 2019 and 2018, only those entities not
incorporated into legal entities and structured as separate vehicles that guarantee transparency of the

rights and obligations of the parties are classified as joint operations.

Salini Impregilo Group’s activities involve its participation in numerous SPEs that, especially in Italy, use the
consortium structure, which works using a cost recharging system. For the purposes of classification under IFRS
10 and 11, these entities have been classified as subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, according to the

guidelines set out above.

Although the investments in the associated consortium entities and entities subject to joint control are measured
using the equity method, their revenues are nonetheless presented in the consolidated financial statements as
the parent recognises the contract work in progress while the costs incurred by the entities are recharged to the
parent and shown in a single cost item (classified among service costs). Therefore, in view of the fact that the
relevant effects concerning consortium entities are already shown in the tables below, the details are not

provided here.
