Sustainability Strategy

Salini Impregilo’s Sustainability Strategy is closely tied to the Group’s business strategy and is underpinned by
two key pillars.

It hinges on the Group’s core business of providing clients and the market with infrastructure for sustainable

mobility, clean hydro energy, clean water and green building solutions to global challenges.

It also embodies the ethical, social and environmental responsibility policies and practices applied by the Group
to protect and enhance people and the environment and to contribute to the social and economic development
of the countries where it operates.

The Sustainability Strategy allows the Group to pursue 11 of the key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
defined by the United Nations.
