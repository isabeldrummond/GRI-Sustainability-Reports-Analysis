As a result of the content of the third resolution, on 20 December 2019, COCIV requested RFI’s consent which
was necessary to enforce the approved by-laws amendment (without prejudice to the immediate enforceability

of the second resolution and of the internal effects of the third resolution).

In the meantime, the term (31 December 2019) set for the coming into force of the first resolution passed
unsuccessfully and, therefore, not only did such resolution not produce any legal effect up to that term, but it
can never produce any future effects (with the related consequences on the first arbitration proceeding

commenced by Condotte).
Condotte lodged a second request for arbitration against the second resolution again under the by-laws.

Acknowledging again there was a dispute commenced by Condotte against the second resolution (solely in
relation to the amendment to the by-laws for which its consent was required), on 20 February 2020, RFI informed
the COCIV and its members Salini Impregilo, Condotte and Civ that “/t was not in a position to decide on the

request for consent made by COCIV’.

It also added that “pursuant to the applicable contractual provisions, RFI’s consent would [have] be [been] given
- only after completion of a specific investigation - into the subsequent allocation among the other consortium

members, including in order to check that the legal and contractual requirements are still met’.

With the support of its legal advisors, Salini Impregilo carried out an analysis of the effects of the resolutions

and the arbitration proceedings proposed by Condotte on its consolidated financial statements.
Specifically, based on the above analysis, the company believes that:

. the reduction resolution is valid as it was passed in accordance with the by-laws and consortium

members’ agreements as a contractually-obliged result of Condotte’s serious breach.

The breach is serious, which is further confirmed by Condotte’s large interest in the consortium
before the reduction to the minimum interest (over 30%, on the basis of which the proportional
obligation to provide counter-guarantees for COCIV is calculated) and by the fact that, under the
structure that the consortium has developed over time in order to perform the contract with RFI (the
consortium’s sole object), the provision of counter-guarantees is absolutely the members’ prevailing

obligation and is essential to enable the consortium to perform the contract with RFI;

. the reduction resolution sets out the consequences of the reduction to the minimum interest of
Condotte’s interest in the consortium’s business (and the consortium fund) in accordance with the

agreements in force and, hence, it was validly passed;

. the reduction resolution was also immediately effective because (a) it could be passed and (b) it
was declared to be passed as such. It relates to the internal relationships among consortium
members and is, therefore, immediately enforceable and productive of the related effects, including
financial (also considering that the provisions of the by-laws and the consortium members’
agreements for the automatic proportional allocation of any interests transferred from other
consortium members and that the consortium members’ agreements even states that the takeover

is as a precise obligation).
