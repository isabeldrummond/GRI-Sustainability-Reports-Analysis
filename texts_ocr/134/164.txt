Methodology for reporting non-financial information

Salini Impregilo was the first Italian construction company to prepare and publish an Environmental Report in
2002 and similarly it was the first to publish a Sustainability Report drawn up in accordance with the Global

Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines in 2009.

Standards applied

This 2019 Consolidated Non-financial Statement has been prepared in accordance with Legislative decree no.
254/2016. The Company has used the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (Core option), published by the
GRI. This Statement also constitutes the Communication on Progress (COP) to Global Compact.

The infrastructure sector and Salini Impregilo’s role

The infrastructure market is highly regulated and its numerous operators are involved in planning, assessing,
approving, developing, building and operating infrastructure according to their roles and responsibilities
assigned by the relevant regulations.
