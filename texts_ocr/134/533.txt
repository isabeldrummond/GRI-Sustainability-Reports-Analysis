15. Comments on COVID-19

We exchanged information constantly with the independent auditors despite the objective operating
difficulties during the final stages of the audit due to the worsening of the public health emergency caused
by COVID-19. Specifically, we monitored the impacts of the “remote” work methods implemented by the
independent auditors, assisted by the company’s structures, in order to check the audit progress.

We noted that the shareholders’ meeting was called in accordance with the exceptional circumstances
rules set out in Decree law no. 18 of 17 March 2020 given the COVID-19 epidemiological emergency.

We also acknowledged that, as required by the ESMA statement of 11 March 2020, the directors specified
the actions taken and considerations made about the possible outcome of the crisis triggered by the
outbreak of COVID-19 in the “Events after the reporting period” section of their report. Specifically, the
directors noted that, given the extraordinary nature of the circumstances related to the spread of COVID-
19 and the general uncertainty, it will update its outlook for 2020 should the crisis have a material impact
on the Group’s financial and economic indicators.

At the date of this report, we note that the directors’ considerations are reasonable as the circumstances
related to COVID-19 and the measures introduced by the competent authorities to contain the pandemic,
which are extraordinary in nature and scope, will have significant repercussions on all economic activities
in Italy and the other countries where the Group operates, with potentially significant follow-on effects,
whose development and impact cannot currently be measured either in general terms or with specific
reference to the Group.
