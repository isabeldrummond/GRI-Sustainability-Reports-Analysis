In 2019, the Group completed the Cityringen metro project, which has a daily capacity of 240 thousand
passengers, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Together with the other existing lines, this new line will provide 85% of

the city’s population with a metro station less than 600 metres from their doorstep.

The hydropower and railway sustainable mobility business areas have huge development potential, as
confirmed by the main projections and estimates available, given their ability to contribute to achievement of the
Paris Climate Agreement objectives and the SGDs. The next graphs show the planned investments for the
hydropower”? and railway2' business areas based on the current scenario (and political policies) and a scenario
where the objective of maintaining the increase in the earth’s temperature below 2° C compared to the pre-

industrial levels is achieved.

Another area where the Group is active in the mitigation of climate change is that of green buildings. Most of the
civil building works now underway use eco-design and construction systems (e.g., LEEDS and GSAS) to
improve the environmental performances of buildings over their entire life cycle compared to similar projects
built using standard criteria. The Group applies these systems to metropolitan infrastructure projects as well,
like those in Qatar and Australia. For example, the Sydney Metro Northwest project, which has been completed,

was built with a carbon footprint of 27% less than the original project envisaged.

The Group's contribution to adaptation to climate change

Salini Impregilo’s business model contributes to help geographical areas adapt to climate change. It builds works
that contribute to dealing with resource scarcity (e.g., water scarcity) and extreme weather events caused by

the global warming. It achieves this mainly through:
