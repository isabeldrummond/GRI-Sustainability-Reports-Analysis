Supported by its legal advisors, the directors are confident that the amounts claimed by the SPEs in which
Astaldi has an investment will be confirmed and fully recovered, also given the assumed continuity of the ongoing

strategic works. Therefore, they have not been impaired.
The group companies are carefully monitoring developments in the situation.

Moreover, the Group cannot exclude that events related to the above-mentioned deed of arrangement may take

place in the future, which would entail changes to the current assessments.
Country risk
Libya

Salini Impregilo S.p.A. operates in Libya through a permanent establishment and a subsidiary, Impregilo Lidco
Libya General Contracting Company (Impregilo Lidco), which has been active in Libya since 2009 and is 60%

owned by Salini Impregilo with the other 40% held by a local partner.

The directors do not deem that significant risks exist with respect to the permanent establishment’s contracts as
work thereon has not started, except for the Koufra Airport project. Moreover, the Group’s exposure for that
project is not material. The Group is also involved in the Libyan Coastal Highway project which leads to the

Egyptian border for the stretch through Cyrenaica, which had not yet been started at the reporting date.
Impregilo Lidco won important contracts for the construction of:

e infrastructural works in Tripoli and Misuratah;

e university campuses in Misuratah, Tarhunah and Zliten;

e anew Conference Hall in Tripoli.

Despite the dramatic political and social events in Libya from 2011, Salini Impregilo has always acted in

accordance with the contractual terms.

This political upheaval has not yet subsided, impeding the subsidiary from developing its business. At present,
Salini Impregilo does not expect activities to be resumed in the near future as there are serious security

problems.

The subsidiary Impregilo Lidco continues to be present in Libya and to maintain contacts with its customers,
complying promptly with legal and corporate requirements. It informed its customers immediately of the
activation of the force majeure clause (provided for contractually) given the situation in Libya, but the projects

covered by the contracts should continue to be a priority for the country.

The customers have acknowledged the contractual rights and the validity of the claims presented for the costs,
losses and damages incurred as a result of the above-mentioned unrest. Once the local situation has normalised

and the country’s institutions are working again, these claims will be discussed with the customers.

The impairment losses on net assets and costs incurred starting from the 2012 financial statements are fully
included in contract liabilities. The subsidiary has presented claims to the customers for these amounts, which

it deems are fully recoverable as they are due to force majeure.
