In September 2006, the public prosecutor at the Naples Court served Impregilo, Impregilo International
Infrastructures N.V., Fibe, Fibe Campania (subsequently merged into Fibe), Fisia Italimpiant S.p.A. (now
Fisia Ambiente S.p.A.) and Gestione Napoli S.p.A. in liquidation with a “Notice of the conclusion of the
preliminary investigations about the administrative liability of companies” related to the alleged administrative
offence pursuant to article 24 of Legislative decree no. 231/2001, as part of criminal proceedings against
some former directors and employees of the above-mentioned companies, who were being investigated for
the crimes covered by article 640.1/2.1, of the Criminal Code in connection with the contracts for
management of the urban solid waste disposal cycle in Campania. Following the preliminary hearing of 29
February 2008, the Preliminary Hearing Judge at the Naples Court allowed the motions for indictment
presented by the public prosecutor, rejecting all the civil parties’ claims against the companies finding them

to be unacceptable.

As part of these proceedings, in its ruling of 26 June 2007, the Preliminary Investigations Judge ordered the

precautionary seizure of the profit from the alleged crime, estimated to approximate €750 million.

The precautionary proceedings continued for nearly five years and finally ended in May 2012, without any
action taken against the Group. On 4 November 2013, the Naples Court handed down a decision finding all
defendants not guilty on all charges. In March 2014, the public prosecutor of Naples challenged the decision
and the Appeal Court disallowed the appeal and confirmed the first level ruling on 22 May 2019. The ruling
became res judicata on 17 October 2019 when the timeline for presentation of an appeal to the Supreme

Court by the public prosecutor expired.

. In 2008, as part of a new investigation into waste disposal in the Campania region carried out after the ope

legis termination of the relevant contracts (on 15 December 2005), the Preliminary Investigations Judge,
upon a request by the public prosecutor, issued personal preventive seizure measures against some
managers and employees of Fibe, Fibe Campania (subsequently merged into Fibe) and Fisia Ambiente and
managers of the commissioner's office. As part of this investigation, which in the record is described both as
a continuation of an earlier investigation and as separate proceedings based on new charges, the former
service providers and Fisia Ambiente are again charged with the administrative liability attributable to
companies pursuant to Legislative decree no. 231/01 without claims for compensation being made against

these companies.

In the hearing of 21 March 2013, the Preliminary Hearing Judge ordered that all the defendants and
companies involved pursuant to Legislative decree no. 231/2001 be committed for trial for all charges,
transferring the proceedings to the Rome Court as a result of an acting judge being listed by the Naples

public prosecutor as under investigation.

At the hearing of 1 April 2014, the Rome Court acquired the ruling delivered by the Fifth Criminal Chamber
of the Naples Court in the aforementioned “parent” proceedings in paragraph 1 above. On 16 June 2016, the
Court accepted the public prosecutor’s request and found all the individuals involved in the proceedings not
guilty. The hearing will continue for the companies involved and the public prosecutor is currently examining

the motions.
