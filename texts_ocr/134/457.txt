22. Post-employment benefits and employee benefits

At 31 December 2019, the company’s liability due to all its employees determined using the criteria set out in
IAS 19 is €12.3 million.

The balance mainly consists of the Italian post-employment benefits (TFR).

At 31 December 2019 and 2018, the liability for post-employment benefits is the outstanding amount at the
reform effective date, net of benefits paid up to the reporting dates. The liability is considered part of a defined
benefit plan under IAS 19 and has, therefore, been subjected to actuarial valuation. The valuation, performed

with the assistance of an independent expert, was based on the following rates:

° turnover rate: 7.25%;
° advance payment rate: 3%;
° inflation rate: 1.2%.

The company has used the Eurocomposite AA index, which has an average financial duration in line with the

fund being valued, to calculate the discount rate.
