December 2018 which are presented in accordance with IAS 17 and related interpretations. Details of the

changes introduced by the new standard are provided below.
The company has elected to use the following practical expedients to restate the opening balances:

a) it has applied a single discount rate to portfolios of leases with similar characteristics and a similar

remaining lease term for a similar class of underlying assets in a similar economic environment;
b) leases that expire before 31 December 2019 have been classified as short-term;
c) it has excluded initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset;
d) it has used hindsight to determine contract variables (specifically the lease term).

In addition to the practical expedients set out above for transition, the company also elected to use the practical
expedients for low-value assets and leases with a term of less than 12 months. Therefore, when the value of
the underlying new individual asset is less than €5,000 or the lease term is less than 12 months, it expenses the

lease payments on a straight-line basis and when incurred.

The company elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components for vehicles, office furniture
and equipment and other assets. It elected to separate non-lease components from lease components for land

and buildings, plant and machinery and industrial and commercial equipment.

It has estimated the lease liability and the right-of-use asset for leases previously classified as operating leases
under IAS 17 and considering the elections made about the transition method and the practical expedients as
follows:

. the lease liability at 1 January 2019 has been measured at the present value of the remaining lease

payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application;

. the right-of-use asset has been estimated using two methods defined on a lease-by-lease basis and,

specifically, at:

= its carrying amount as if the standard had been applied since the commencement date, but

discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2019;

= an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease
payments relating to that lease recognised in the statement of financial position at 31 December
2018 under IAS 17.

The significant judgements made to apply IFRS 16 that had a material impact on the estimate of the assets and

liabilities related to the discount rate and the lease term include:

a) the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate was used to discount the lease payments, estimated using the
lease’s reference currency, economic context and class of underlying asset. The weighted average of
the rates applied is 4.4%.
