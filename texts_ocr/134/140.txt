was thus able to give a real contribution to the promotion of sustainability principles and the circular economy
applied to the construction industry and has gained valuable experience to give it a competitive edge once the

framework becomes applicable.
In 2019, Line 3 of the Riyadh Metro in Saudi Arabia garnered great recognition for its environmental results.

During the start-up of a new contract and based on the planned work, the plant to be built and the areas to be
used for logistics and building work, an environmental risk assessment is performed to identify significant
environmental aspects, i.e., those aspects that could have a follow-on significant impact on the environment.
Their identification and assessment of the significance of their impact as well as the subsequent definition of

impact management and mitigation measures take place in line with specific procedures.

The significance of environmental impacts is assessed using a method based on an analysis of well defined
criteria, such as the existence of special regulatory or contractual requirements, assessment of the related risk,

management of the impact and the area’s sensitivity to the specific environmental aspect.

The assessment considers various scenarios: standard operating conditions, irregular conditions (e.g., plant
start-up), emergencies (e.g., fire, spills). Once the significant environmental aspects have been identified, the

main effects of the contract work and other activities on the different environmental components are analysed:

e natural and energy resources;

e atmosphere and climate (emissions);

e soil, subsoil and water environment;

e waste and use of hazardous substances/preparations;
e traffic, atmospheric, light and electromagnetic pollution;
e noise and vibrations;

e ecosystem, cultural heritage and environmental restoration.

After the environmental risk assessment, analysis of the contractual obligations and related environmental

regulations, the following is prepared for each contract:

e environmental plans/procedures setting out guidelines for the management/protection of each specific

environmental component;

e environmental protection plans defining the specific mitigation and monitoring activities to be adopted
in the specific area;

e environmental monitoring and control plans defining the specific management and monitoring activities
for the environmental components identified in the various areas;

e specific instructions for the different method statements applied.

In addition and to comply with the client’s instructions, the project's social-environmental impact assessment

and ruling legislation, the contract undergoes environmental monitoring to check any unforeseen variations
