IFRS 16 - Leases

The Group adjusted the figures for 2018, using the best estimates available, to reflect the application of IFRS

16. These estimates were based on the following:

= leases include those in place at 31 December 2018 and, therefore, they do not include those of the

Plants & Paving Division sold at the end of that year;

=» the IFRS 16 FTA effects on profit or loss have been estimated by anticipating the date of initial

application from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2018 or an interim date if the lease was agreed in 2018;
= the discount rates at 1 January 2019 have been used.

The section on the “Change in standards” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a

description of the standard and the effects of its application.
