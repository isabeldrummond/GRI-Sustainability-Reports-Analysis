Changes during the year are set out below:

(€000) 31 December 2018 Increases Impairment losses Net exchange gains 31 December 2019

Lane Group 74,713 1,348 76,061

Total 74,713 1,348 76,061

The recoverability of the carrying amounts related to Lane was checked by comparing the net invested capital
of Lane Group, which is a separate CGU, with the related recoverable amounts, which are the estimated future

cash flows arising from the assets’ continuing use discounted to their net present value (“value in use”).
The main assumptions adopted to calculate value in use are as follows:

e long-term growth rate: 1.74%;

e post-tax discount rate: 7.4%
The Group has adopted the discount rate calculated based on the market cost of money and the asset sector’s
specific risk (Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC). Specifically, the Group considered the return rate on

long-term government bonds and the average capital structure of a basket of comparable companies.

The CGU’s recoverable amount has been calculated using the cash flow projections set out in the five-year
2020-2024 plan prepared and approved by management. The terminal value is based on a sustainable profit

assumption, from which stable long-term operating cash flows have been estimated, on a going concern basis.

The Group also performed sensitivity analyses of the recoverable amount, considering the potential effect of

changes in the reference parameters of the discount rate (+4.1%) and terminal value (reduction of 49%).

The Group tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting date, supported by independent experts who carried
out an independent business review, which showed that the CGU’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying

amount (net invested capital).
