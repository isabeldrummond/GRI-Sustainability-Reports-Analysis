impairment loss is required, this is recognised immediately in profit or loss. When the reasons for a previous
impairment loss no longer exist, the carrying amount of the investment is restated to the extent of its original

cost. Reversals of impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.

Impairment of non-financial assets

If there is any indication that an intangible asset or an item of property, plant and equipment is impaired, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Goodwill and

other intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested at least annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

If a binding sales agreement does not exist, fair value is estimated using the observable prices of an active
market, recent transactions or the best information available to reflect the amount the entity could obtain by

disposing of the asset.

Value in use is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing
use of an asset, net of taxes, and, if reasonably determinable, from its disposal at the end of its useful life.
Discounting is applied by using a post-tax discount rate which reflects the current market assessments of the

time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

The assessment is made for individual assets or the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets from its continuing
use (cash-generating unit). An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount is lower than the
carrying amount. If the reasons for the impairment loss are no longer valid, the impairment loss (except in the
case of goodwill) is reversed and the adjustment is taken to profit or loss as a reversal of impairment losses. A
reversal of impairment losses is recognised to the extent of the lower of the recoverable amount and original
carrying amount less depreciation/amortisation that would have been recognised had the impairment loss not

been recognised.
Inventories of goods

Inventories of goods are measured at the lower of average purchase cost and net realisable value. Cost includes
the directly related costs and estimated realisable value is determined using the replacement cost of the assets
or similar assets. Any write-downs are eliminated in subsequent years when the reasons therefor are no longer

valid.
Contract assets and liabilities

Contract assets and liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with the guidelines of IFRS 15 -

Revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised using the five-step model as set out below:
1. Identify the contract with a customer;
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract;

3. Determine the transaction price;
