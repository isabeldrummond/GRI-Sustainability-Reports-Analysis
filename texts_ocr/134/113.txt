The Company has operating procedures and practices designed to ensure that its remuneration policies comply
with the regulations applicable in the countries where the Group operates and especially the minimum wage
requirements, where these exist. At both corporate and operating level, the Company regularly meets with the

trade union representatives (when appointed) to discuss remuneration.

resources to stay with the Company and the Group; align, as far as possible, management's interests with the
medium to long-term interests of shareholders and stakeholders; ensure financial balance and the sustainability

of its policies over time.
