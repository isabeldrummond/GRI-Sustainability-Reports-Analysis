The business areas in which Salini Impregilo operates have a close link to climate change, in terms of mitigation
and adaptation abilities. The ongoing worsening in the climate crisis, which has had follow-on effects that are
much more serious and rapid than originally envisaged, is an opportunity for the Group to increase its

contribution to fighting climate change and build its business.
