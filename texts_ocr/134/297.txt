e the loss allowance for Venezuelan exposures of €249.5 million, described in more detail in the
"Impairment - Venezuela" section;

e the loss allowance of €45.8 million related to receivables due to COCIV from the consortium member
Condotte given that it is currently under extraordinary administration;

e default interest of €60.3 million most refers to Fibe S.p.A. and the Venezuelan branch (due to the

impairment losses described in more detail later in this report).

Impairment - Venezuela

Assisted by its independent experts, the Group estimated the impairment losses on the Venezuelan financial

assets in line with its approach taken in the 2018 financial statements.

The impairment model selected is the discounted cash flow (DCF) model in line with the amortised cost approach
of IFRS 9. Estimating amortised cost usually requires the preparation of a possible repayment plan that is

economically and financially feasible for the debtor.

Given the uncertainty about the expected collection rates and the time involved (i.e., the length of the litigation),

the Group prepared 16 scenarios using various combinations of inputs.
It then defined the following parameters:

e the nominal amount reduction;
e the total repayment delay;
e the repayment structure (equal or increasing instalments).
The interval (50% - 73% compared to 37% - 51%) for the nominal amount reduction was defined using the

default episode samples obtained from last year’s impairment test (2018).
This was decided to properly factor in the following considerations:

e the stagnant political, social and economic scenario for the third consecutive year;
e the negative signals about the current and possible future oil prices and the significant fall in the prices
of the Venezuelan government bonds in the second half of 2019;

The sample included the “extreme” default episodes of 2018 (i.e., Panama ‘96 and Bolivia ‘88).

With respect to the recoverable amount of the Group's exposure to the Venezuelan government agencies, at 31
December 2019, its gross exposure amounts to €643.4 million, of which loan assets of €120.2 million and
consideration accrued on work performed of approximately €523.2 million (the latter amount comprises €318.7
million already invoiced and recognised under trade receivables and €204.5 million recognised under contract

assets net of contract liabilities).

As a result of the assessments made on the basis of that set out above, the Group's net exposure to the
Venezuelan government agencies amounts to €128.7 million, of which loan assets of €24.0 million and
consideration accrued on work performed of approximately €104.7 million (the latter amount comprises €63.8
million already invoiced and recognised under trade receivables and €40.9 million recognised under contract

assets net of contract liabilities).
