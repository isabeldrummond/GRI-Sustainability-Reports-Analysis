The Group’s share of the construction work is 25.5% of the civil works.

On 13 December 2018, the consortium and the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications signed
Addendum 2, which established the new delivery dates with a revised work schedule and billing programme. It

also defined new concession areas in some cases.

The contract consideration is approximately USD3 billion.

Unforeseen costs have been incurred on the Forrestfield Airport Link (Australia), Koysha Hydroelectric Project
(Ethiopia), Gerd (Ethiopia), Rogun Hydropower Project (Tajikistan) and Line 14, Lot 4 (France) contracts referred
to above and the contractor has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are
included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be

recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors.
