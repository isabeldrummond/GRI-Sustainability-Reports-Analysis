It cannot be excluded that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that would

require changes to the valuations made.

The subsidiary Fibe recorded a loss of €8.2 million for 2019, while its equity was €27.6 million at the reporting
date. Given that the subsidiary is inactive and only manages the outstanding disputes related to the USW
Campania projects, its assets and liabilities are the main drivers of the value generation process. Accordingly,
its carrying amount was aligned with its equity at the reporting date, recognising an impairment loss of €8.2

million.

The subsidiary Salini Impregilo US Holding INC made a loss of €2.1 million in 2019, with equity of approximately
€251.2 million at the reporting date, while the investment’s carrying amount is €468.4 million.
Its equity value has been calculated using the cash flow projections set out in the 2020-2024 five-year plan
prepared and approved by the subsidiary’s management.
The main valuation parameters used were:

e long-term growth rate: 1.74%;

e post-tax discount rate: 7.4%
The company has adopted the discount rate calculated based on the market cost of money and the asset
sector’s specific risk (Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC). Specifically, the company considered the
return rate on long-term government bonds and the average capital structure of a basket of comparable

companies.

The terminal value is based on a sustainable profit assumption, from which stable long-term operating cash

flows have been estimated, on a going concern basis.

The company tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting date, supported by independent experts who
carried out an independent business review, which showed that the investment’s recoverable amount exceeds

its carrying amount.

The company also performed sensitivity analyses of the recoverable amount, considering the potential effect of

changes in the reference parameters of the discount rate (+4.1%) and terminal value (reduction of 49%).

The company tested its investment in Yuma for impairment in 2019 using the Colombian operator’s 2020-2031
business plan assisted by an external expert. Its cash flows were discounted using a cost of equity rate of 9.6%
to calculate the investment’s recoverable amount. The resulting recoverable amount was higher than the equity

investment’s carrying amount and, therefore, it was not necessary to recognise an impairment loss.

As regards the other investments in smaller companies, their carrying amount has been adjusted to Salini
Impregilo’s share of the investees’ net assets as recognised in their financial statements at 31 December 2019
when impairment losses have been identified. These impairment losses, totalling €9.4 million, specifically
affected Impregilo Arabia Ltd (€5.0 million) and Salini Polska SP Zoo Ltd (€2.9 million), the latter recognised in

the provision for risks on equity investments.
