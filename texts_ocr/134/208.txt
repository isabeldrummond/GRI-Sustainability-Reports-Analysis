In addition, the investments made to date are covered by the contract advances received from the customers.
The subsidiary’s legal advisors agree with this approach as can be seen in their reports.

No significant risks are deemed to exist for the recovery of the net assets attributable to the subsidiary, thanks

in part to actions and claims filed against the customers.

As this country’s situation continues to be complex and critical, the Group does not expect that operations can

be resumed in the short term.

Salini Impregilo will continue to guarantee the subsidiary’s business continuity. However, it cannot be excluded
that events which cannot currently be foreseen may take place after the date of preparation of this report that

require changes to the assessments made to date.
Argentina

The severe crisis that has affected Argentina's economy in the period from 2017 to 2019 has caused a significant
depreciation of the Argentinian peso, an over 30% hike in public debt and an increase in accumulated inflation

of more than 250%. It was the main factor that caused the previous government to lose the election.

The 2019 budget law introduced strong anti-crisis economic measures in line with the IMF’s terms. The new
government took office in December 2019. The Group is building a hydraulic tunnel (lot 3) and a wastewater
pre-treatment plant (lot 2) as part of a mega project for the environmental restoration project of the Riachuelo

River in Buenos Aires for the Argentinian government.
Venezuela

Salini Impregilo Group has operated in Venezuela for over thirty years and has a stable presence there through
its permanent organisation. It carries out important projects to develop the South American country directly or in

partnerships with international partners.
The work in progress, mainly in the railway and hydroelectric sectors, relates to the following contracts:
- Railway sector:

i) Puerto Cabello - La Encrucijada section project;

ii) Guarico project, for the San Juan de Los Morros - San Fernando de Apure and Chaguaramas - Cabruta

sections;
- Hydroelectric sector:
i) the Tocoma dam project.

The customers for the above projects are all government agencies (the Venezuelan government or related
bodies).

In the past, the Venezuelan government reconfirmed its intention to complete the railway and hydroelectrical
projects, deemed to be of strategic interest for the country’s development. However, these contracts have seen

non-payment, temporary suspensions and minimum maintenance activities in the last two years.
