It makes whistleblowing systems available to workers and third parties, safeguarding whistleblowers from any

retaliatory action.

In this respect, in 2014, the Company signed a framework agreement with the national trade unions (Feneal-
UIL, Filca-CISL and Fillea-CGIL) and the international trade union for the construction sector (BWI - Building
and Wood Workers’ International) to jointly affirm and encourage respect for compliance with the basic principles
and rights in employment relationships, encourage social justice and sustainable development by both itself and

the consortia of which it is a member and vis-a-vis its contractors, subcontractors and suppliers.

The framework agreement covers child labour, forced or compulsory labour, the freedom of association and
collective bargaining, non-discrimination, work hours, economic treatment, work conditions, specialised training,

the environment, welfare and employment relationships.

Main risks and management methods
The Company has implemented a due diligence process in line with the UN Guiding principles for business and
human rights.
This process entailed mapping the potential impact on human rights of the Company’s operations by analysing:
- human rights enshrined in the international law instruments applicable to the Company;
- parties potentially at risk;

- internal processes.

The outcome was the Human Rights Impact Matrix, which was then used to measure the risks and prioritise the

human rights relevant to the Group.

The Company used its findings and the analysis of the applicable standards and market best practices to define

its Human Rights Policy, issued in 2019.

The principles embedded in this Policy are also referred to in the Suppliers Code of Conduct issued at the start

of 2020 to extend the Company’s internal practices to its supply chain.

At corporate level, the Corporate Social Responsibility Department coordinates the human rights due diligence,
defines the internal standards and guidelines, the reporting, disclosure and training methods and provides

specialist assistance to the other internal units.

In 2019, all the operating entities included in the scope of this Statement underwent a human rights risk

assessment to analyse the risks specific to each entity and the related mitigation measures adopted.
