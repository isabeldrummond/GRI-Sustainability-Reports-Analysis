preparation of the 2019 Annual Report and the 2019 Interim Financial Report;

c) obtaining information about the existence of the conditions required by article 15 of the Market
Regulation adopted with Consob resolution no. 20249 of 28 December 2017 (formerly article 36 of the
Market Regulation adopted with Consob resolution no. 16191 of 29 October 2007) for significant
subsidiaries set up in and regulated by laws of non-EU states. We also checked that circumstances entailing
non-compliance with the conditions did not exist as they would have required reporting to Consob and
Borsa Italiana S.p.A. pursuant to article 15.1.c.ii;

d) reviewing the reports prepared by the manager in charge of financial reporting and the internal audit
supervisor on the adequacy of the administrative and accounting procedures pursuant to Law no. 262/05
and the results of the related tests as per the annual mandate assigned by the manager in charge of
financial reporting;

e) meeting the independent auditors and analysing the findings of their work;
f) reviewing internal documents.

We also acknowledged that, independently and before the approval of the separate financial statements,
on 11 March 2020, the board of directors approved the impairment test applied by the company during
preparation of the financial statements at 31 December 2019 and the impairment test procedures to be
applied to the financial statements of the group companies, after receiving the favourable opinion of the
control, risk and sustainability committee and pursuant to the recommendations issued by the ESMA on
21 January 2013, the joint Bank of Italy/Consob/Isvap document no. 4 of 3 March 2010 and Consob
communication no. 3907 of 19 January 2015.

We did not identify any critical situations or facts during the above activities that would have led us to
believe that the company’s administrative and accounting system was inadequate and/or unreliable
during the year.

12. Adequacy of the instructions given to subsidiaries

The company regulates the information provided by the subsidiaries, especially that related to more
important transactions, with specific procedures.

We believe that the instructions issued by the company to its subsidiaries pursuant to article 114.2 of the
TUF are adequate to ensure compliance with the legal disclosure requirements.

13. Issues which arose during meetings with the independent auditors

During our activities related to the 2019 Annual Report, we met the independent auditors:

- to exchange information about the checks performed in accordance with Legislative decree no.
39/2010 and article 150.3 of the TUF to ensure the company’s accounts were kept properly and that
the accounting entries accurately reflected its operations. No issues arose as a result of these meetings;

- to examine and assess the procedures used to prepare the 2019 Interim Financial Report and the 2019
Annual Report, including the assessment of the correct application of the accounting policies and their
consistency; we also reviewed the audit findings and assessment of these reports;

Specifically, we:

- analysed the audit procedures performed by the auditors and, in particular, their methodology, the audit
approach to key audit matters and audit planning;

- discussed issues related to the company’s risks with the auditors and were favourably impressed by the
adequacy of their planned approach to the structural and risk profiles of the company and the Group.
