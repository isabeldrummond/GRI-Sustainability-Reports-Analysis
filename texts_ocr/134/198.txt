The arbitration proceedings are at an initial stage as the tribunal has only recently been set up.

The directors deem the risk of an unfavourable award to be remote, also based on the opinion of their legal
advisors.

During preparation of the contract budget and the consolidated financial statements, they considered the above
costs and compensation for the subcontractor’s delays and negligence to the extent they deem it is highly

probable that its counterclaim will be successful, also based on the opinion of their legal advisors.

However, they cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and

that could make it necessary to change their valuations.

Slovakia

On 6 March 2019, the joint venture comprising Salini Impregilo and the Slovakian company Duha and the
customer signed an agreement to terminate the contract for the design and construction of a major motorway

section. This agreement provides for the recognition of the works awaiting certification and also establishes that:

* the customer will certify most of the works performed and awaiting approval for bureaucratic reasons in

the short term;

* a dispute adjudication board (DAB) will be appointed, consisting of international members rather than
the Slovakian members provided for in the original contract, to decide on the additional consideration

requested by the Group;

* should the DAB’s ruling not be agreeable to the parties, they may apply to an international arbitration

tribunal (ICC Vienna) rather than a Slovakian tribunal as provided for in the original contract.

After the joint venture’s presentation of its claims, on 18 November 2019, the DAB issued its report, finding that
the joint venture was due approximately €8 million as part of the extra costs claimed. In December 2019, both
the joint venture and the customer sent the DAB a notice of dissatisfaction. Should the parties be unable to

come to an agreement, they may apply for arbitration as contractually provided for.

Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the joint venture has accordingly presented its request for additional
consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed

highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors.

Moreover, the Group cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen

and that could make it necessary to change its valuations.
