Specifically, the LTIFR (Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate) is calculated as the ratio of the total number of injuries
leading to absence from work in the period (including death) to the total number of hours worked, multiplied by
1,000,000.

The TRFR (Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate) is calculated as the ratio of total recordable injuries
(calculated considering deaths, injuries leading to absence from work, injuries only requiring medical treatment
and injuries leading to assignment of reduced workloads in countries where this is allowed) to the total number
of hours worked, multiplied by 1,000,000.

Any commuting injuries during the period are not considered.

Energy consumption and GHG emissions

The calculation of direct energy consumption is based on the conversion factors provided by the UK Department
for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy - BEIS (2016 Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company
Reporting). Internal energy consumption refers to the in-scope entities’ direct activities. Indirect energy
consumption, like scope 3 emissions, refer to activities performed by subcontractors. The Group monitors its

emissions data using an operating control approach.
Calculations of the Group’s GHG emissions are based on:

e the emission factors defined by the standard parameters of the UK Department for Business, Energy &
Industrial Strategy — BEIS (2016 Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting) for fuel
consumption - the calculation includes COz, CH4 and N2O gases;

e the emission factors provided by the International Energy Agency (CO2 Emissions from Fuel
Combustion, 2013 edition, 2011 data) for electric energy consumption;

e the emission factors provided by the IPCC (Fourth Assessment Report AR4 100yr) to convert CH4 and
N20 into COz equivalent.

The energy intensity rates and the GHG emission rates are calculated by comparing the total data (energy
consumption and GHG emissions) to revenue for the period. Specifically, the intensity rate for GHG emissions

includes the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

Water use

Data about water not taken from aqueducts, not obtained from other sources (e.g., water tanks) and not
measured using meters are calculated considering the withdrawal systems’ capacity (pump capacity in the

average number of working hours) or production activity performed in the period.

Waste

The data refers to waste generated by the in-scope contracts in line with the locally-applicable regulations. When

the data is expressed as a volume, the related weight is calculated using specific conversion factors. Information
