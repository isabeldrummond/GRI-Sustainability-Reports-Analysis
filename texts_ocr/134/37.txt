output. The project will extend the high speed/capacity service to southern Italy, connecting it to the rest of Italy

and reducing travel times by between 20% to 45%.

The University of Sannio carried out a study which estimated that the new line will lead to demographic growth
of 2.1% in the municipalities it crosses thanks to the stops along the way. This, in turn, should trigger growth of

1.6% in the related provinces’ GDP and an increase of 6.6% in the residents’ average income.

With respect to the Naples - Cancello section of the Naples - Bari railway line, the contract for which was signed
in December 2017 by the joint venture led by Salini Impregilo (60% share), the contract advance was received
on 5 April 2019. During 2019, work commenced including the clearing of ordnance and laying of the foundations

for some viaducts and tunnel sections.

On 26 November 2019, Salini Impregilo signed a rider with RFI for the supply of crushed stone by the joint
venture and the removal of the above-ground materials in areas located in the Casoria Municipality. This

increased the contract consideration to approximately €417.7 million.
