Contracts with suppliers include provisions requiring them to comply with the applicable regulations, the Code
of Ethics, the 231 Model and the Anti-corruption Model as well as quality, health and safety and environment

requirements. The contracts have specific termination clauses if the suppliers do not comply therewith.

Once the contract has been signed and is effective, the Company monitors the performance of its key suppliers
using a special assessment process, involving the head office’s Procurement Department and the contract
managers. It assesses suppliers once a year. In 2019, these assessments involved more than 16 contracts
selected for their financial relevance. They covered nearly all the suppliers of the analysed contracts (response
rate of above 95%) included in the assessment scope, showing average performances (measured using the

IVR vendor rating index) of above 80/100, confirming the high quality of the Group’s supply base.

The assessment process is flanked by the on-site monitoring of projects by the local QEHS Departments, which
mainly cover subcontractors and is designed to check that their activities comply with the Company’s quality
standards and applicable requirements for the environment, health and safety. Specifically, the local QEHS
Departments regularly audit the subcontractors. Any non-compliance is managed in accordance with the
management system procedures and includes the agreement of improvement plans and follow-up checks to

ensure that they are implemented.

Involvement of the subcontractors in these issues also takes the form of regular coordination meetings and the

participation of their employees in classroom and on-site QEHS training courses (230,002 hours in 2019).

In addition to involving and monitoring suppliers at the work sites, the Company also interacted with them at

central level during the year.

This includes the annual supplier meeting attended by the Group’s Italian and international employees and
suppliers when the main procurement practices are presented. The Company presented, inter alia, the results
of the vetting process and the assessment of suppliers’ performances during the 2019 meeting to emphasise
the importance to the Company of developing long-term relationships that allow the suppliers to grow and ensure

their constant improvement.

The Company continued its Innovation Days in 2019, which are appointments with individual suppliers attended
by head office employees. They are an opportunity for the supplier and the Company to discuss their

experiences about new technologies, products, innovative processes and other matters of mutual interest.
