As an integral part of the Valyou - Our Health and Safety Way, Salini Impregilo adopted and rolled out its “Your

Lifesaving Rules” in April 2019, a set of operating and management rules, devised to:

e integrate the culture change process commenced with the Safety Builders Program;

e foster workers’ active involvement;

e strengthen the sense of belonging to the Group;

e systematise conduct;

e promote the purposive adoption of the Group’s Health & Safety Vision.
These rules were prepared using analyses that included injury statistics, rules already applied at the work sites,
analyses of accidents and injuries, sector and other benchmarks and risk magnitude. The Company made two

videos to be used during the training courses to launch this project.

The Company’s main workplaces celebrated the World Day for Safety and Health at Work in April 2019 when it
introduced the above Your Lifesaving Rules. This involved more than 200 employees in the Rome and Milan
offices in Italy and over 20 group Italian and foreign work sites, which presented projects about the rules and

other programmes designed to meet the specific requirements of individual work sites.

The entire Valyou - Our Health and Safety Way won the prestigious Silver Award at the RoSPA Awards 2019,

qualifying as one of the international programmes with the best practices in its sector in 2018.

The award was conferred during the official ceremony held in London at the ExCel Exhibition Centre organised
by RoSPA - Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents on 18 June 2019. This UK institution is one of the
most important in its sector and its patron is Queen Elisabeth II. It rewards organisations from around the world

each year that stand out for their commitment to accident prevention and the protection of occupational health.

Another Salini Impregilo project won the RoSPA Gold Award for the construction of the Cityringen metro line in
Copenhagen, Denmark for the following reason: “The RoSPA Gold Award winners have achieved a very high
level of performance, demonstrating well developed occupational health and safety management systems and

culture, outstanding control of risk and very low levels of error, harm and loss.”

At the end of 2018, the Cityringen project, completed during the year by a joint venture led by Salini Impregilo,
had achieved one million hours worked without a single accident, which is a very significant result considering
the size and complexity of the project. Thousands of people from various countries, including Denmark, Italy,

Poland, Ireland and Romania, worked at 22 work sites in central Copenhagen.

There has been a large decrease in the number of work-related injuries thanks to the awareness projects about
occupational health and safety (ValYou, Safety Builders Program, Your Life Saving Rules, tailored training
courses as well as mandatory courses) implemented at the work sites and management’s significant

involvement in promoting culture change programmes.

The injury rates are set out below, expressed as the number of events for every million hours worked:
