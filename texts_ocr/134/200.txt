Both parties initiated proceedings about the merits of the case. The judge rejected the request for default interest

submitted by Fibe in the ruling of 12 February 2016, which Fibe challenged.

As part of the USW Campania projects, the Group was notified of a large number of administrative measures
regarding reclamation and the implementation of safety measures at some of the landfills, storage areas and
RDF plants. For the proceedings regarding the characterisation and emergency safety measures at the
Pontericcio site, the RDF plant in Giugliano and the temporary storage area at Cava Giuliani, the Lazio Regional
Administrative Court rejected the appeals filed by Fibe with ruling no. 6033/2012. An appeal against this ruling,
based on contamination found at a site different to those subject of the proceedings, was filed with the Council
of State. It denied Fibe’s precautionary motion to stay the enforcement of the decision. The Council of State
subsequently accepted Fibe’s appeal in its ruling no. 5076/2018, reversing the first level ruling and cancelling
the measures challenged by Fibe. With respect to the Cava Giuliani landfill, the Lazio Regional Administrative
Court, with ruling no. 5831/2012, found that it lacked jurisdiction in favour of the Superior Court of Public Waters,
before which the appeal was summed up and a decision has not yet been taken. Meanwhile, Fibe has completed
the characterisation operations for the above sites, but this does not constitute any admission of liability

whatsoever.
S.a.Bro.M. S.p.A.

S.a.Bro.M. S.p.A. (“SABROM’) is the operator for the design, construction and operation of the new regional
Broni-Mortara motorway under the terms of the concession contract signed with the customer Infrastrutture
Lombarde S.p.A. (“ILSpA”) on 16 September 2010.

In July 2016, the Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea Protection (“MATTM’) issued a measure containing

a negative opinion on the project’s environmental compatibility.

SABROM asked the customer to protect the project by appealing against the Ministry’s measure and also
communicated its willingness to work with the customer to modify the designs so that the project could be re-

assessed by the Ministry and other competent bodies.

As requested by SABROM, the customer appealed against the Ministry’s measure before the Lombardy
Regional Administrative Court which rejected the appeal with its ruling published on 30 July 2018.

On 14 February 2019, ILSpA filed an appeal with the Council of State and the date of the hearing has not yet

been set.

The directors deem the risk of an unfavourable ruling is remote and that the assets recognised under intangible

assets at 31 December 2019 are recoverable, supported by their legal advisors.

However, they cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and

that could make it necessary to change their valuations.
