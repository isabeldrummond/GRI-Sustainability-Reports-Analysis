The following table shows the Group’s initiatives to reduce its GHG emissions:

Reduction in GHG emissions tCO2e 53,202 42,440 52,253

 

Over the last three years, initiatives have been rolled out to improve the energy efficiency of industrial processes,
to adapt current production processes, to adopt less polluting logistics options and to introduce awareness
campaigns for employees. In addition, many of the Company’s innovation, research and development projects
(see the relevant section) have a strong environmental factor in terms of their energy efficiency and reduction in

GHG emissions.

In addition to consumption and direct emissions, which the Group intends to contain over the next few years,
Salini Impregilo works to reduce the indirect emissions from its related activities (transportation and travel of its
employees) as much as possible. As well as the specific projects described in the section on innovation,
research and development, the Company’s procurement policy designed to mostly use local suppliers (94% in
2019) eliminates the need for long transport journeys, reducing the related emissions. When the goods are not
available on the local market, the Group prefers to ship materials and machinery by sea as this is the means of

transport with the lowest carbon footprint.

Over the last few years, the Group has equipped its offices and work sites with video conference systems which
have reduced the number of business trips to those essential for operating reasons. Its travel policy favours

travelling by train rather than by plane and the use of public transport rather than taxis.

When possible, contracts have personnel mobility management programmes designed to optimise transfers
between work areas, the canteens and employee accommodation. They include the use of collective transport

methods (buses) for blue collars and car-pooling for white collars at the work site offices.

Climate change risks

Climate change can provoke various types of risk for a business, depending on the nature of its operations and

the markets where it operates.

The Company is mostly exposed to the risk of an increase in adverse weather events that can affect the normal
scheduling and performance of its works leading to delays. This risk is not currently deemed high and is
managed using the normal contract scheduling procedures, where the work programme (number of hours that
can be worked per day and annual work days) is defined and updated considering weather forecasts, based on
historical data available. Exceptional weather events that affect compliance with the timeline agreed with clients
can be handled through the contract or by negotiation and usually lead to acceptance of a time extension and/or

compensation for the higher costs incurred.

The risk of damage to assets by adverse weather conditions is also considered to be low, thanks to the related

insurance contracts.
