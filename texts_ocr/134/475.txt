Leases include rent and leases with variable payments or that are covered by the practical expedients of IFRS
16 in 2019 (see note 2). The company elected to use the practical expedient for assets of a low value and leases

with a term of less than 12 months and the related payments are recognised in profit or loss immediately.

The leases in 2018 also included the costs of rent and leases that have required the recognition of a lease

liability and a right-of-use asset since 1 January 2019.

The €24.4 million decrease in “Leases” is due to the company’s application of IFRS 16 starting from 1 January
2019.

“Recharging of costs by consortia” of roughly €790.9 million relates to Italian consortia and consortium

companies, especially the high speed/capacity Milan - Genoa railway line section.

“Consultancy and technical services” decreased by €87.8 million and mainly consist of the design and
construction costs incurred by the SPEs and legal and administrative consultancy fees. A breakdown of this item
