7. Frequency of attendance at company body meetings

In 2019, we attended all 21 meetings of the board of directors during which we were informed about the
operations and key transactions performed by the company and its subsidiaries. We also received
information about the exercise of his powers from the chief executive officer.

We met 15 times during 2019 and during our meetings we exchanged information with the independent
auditors to ensure that no transactions took place that were imprudent or risky, could give rise to
potential conflicts of interest, are not compliant with the law or the company’s by-laws or the
shareholders’ resolutions or that could prejudice the company’s assets.

We attended 10 meetings of the control and risk committee (now the “control, risk and sustainability
committee”), seven meetings of the compensation and nominating committee and three meetings of the
committee for related-party transactions, obtaining information on the work they performed during the
year.

We also participated in the ordinary shareholders’ meeting held on 24 April 2019, the special meeting of
the holders of savings shares of 27 June 2019 and the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of 4 October
2019.

During 2020 and up to the date of this report, we attended all the meetings of the company bodies and,
specifically, seven meetings of the board of directors, four meetings of the control, risk and sustainability
committee, six meetings of the compensation and nominating committee and two meetings of the
committee for related-party transactions. We have met eight times so far this year.

8. Compliance with correct administration standards

We have no comments to make about compliance with such standards based on our work. We checked
that the directors are aware of the riskiness and effects of the transactions performed.

Specifically, we checked that management decisions were taken in the company’s interests, in line with its
resources and assets and that they were adequately supported by information, analysis and checking
processes, including by resort to the committees and external professionals, when necessary.

9. Adequacy of the organisational structure.

We obtained information about the company’s organisational structure and any modifications thereto on
a regular basis, including through meetings with the competent company managers. As a result, we believe
that the company’s organisational structure, procedures, duties and responsibilities are adequate given
its size and type of activities.

We also checked the adequacy of the organisation structure of the company and its key subsidiaries,
focusing on their internal controls and risk management.

10. Adequacy of internal controls and risk management

We supervised the adequacy of the internal controls and risk management of the company and its key
subsidiaries as follows:

a. we regularly obtained information from the director in charge of the internal control and risk
management system, the competent manager, the internal audit supervisor, the compliance
supervisor, the group risk officer and the heads of the other departments involved from time to time
about the activities carried out, the mapping of risks related to ongoing activities, test programmes
and projects to implement internal controls; we also obtained the related documentation;

b. we participated regularly in the activities of the control, risk and sustainability committee set up in line
with the Code of Conduct for Listed Companies as well as the board of directors’ meetings;
