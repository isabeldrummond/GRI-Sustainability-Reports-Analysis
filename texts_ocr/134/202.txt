COCIV consortium

On 26 October 2016, some managers and employees of COCIV were arrested as were other persons (including
the chairman of Reggio Calabria - Scilla S.C.p.A., who promptly resigned) with warrants issued on 7 October
2016 by the Genoa Court and 10 October 2016 by the Rome Court. The above two legal entities were informed
that the Genoa and Rome public prosecutors are investigating alleged obstruction of public tender procedures,

corruption and, in some cases, criminal organisation.

Specifically, the proceeding before the Genoa Court (involving COCIV managers and employees) covers alleged
obstruction of public tender procedures for supplies or works on individual lots (for which the public prosecutor
also intends to investigate Salini Impregilo’s chief executive officer) as well as two cases of corruption. The
proceeding originally before the Rome Court (consisting of two separate investigations), and now joined and
transferred to the Alessandria public prosecutor, relates to the alleged bribery of works management by senior
management of the contractors (COCIV, Reggio Calabria — Scilla S.C.p.A. and Salerno-Reggio Calabria s.c.p.a.)
in order to encourage the works manager (also under investigation) to perform acts contrary to their official
duties.

On 11 January 2017, as part of the proceedings commenced on 16 November 2016, ANAC sent the Rome
Prefecture a proposal for adoption of the extraordinary measures pursuant to article 32 of Decree law no. 90 of
24 June 2014 against COCIV. On 3 March 2017, the Rome Prefecture appointed a special commissioner for
the extraordinary and temporary administration of COCIV in accordance with article 32.1.b) of the above Decree

law for a six-month period, which was then extended to 15 January 2019.

The Rome Prefecture acknowledged termination of the extraordinary and temporary administration of COCIV
on 31 October 2018 with its decree of 14 November 2018, given that the set objectives had been met.

Specifically, in 2018, the Genoa public prosecutor notified the completion of the preliminary investigations for
the criminal proceedings to the parties under investigation, which included COCIV. During 2019, the public
prosecutor requested and obtained a hearing of an excerpt of the relevant interceptions, which was followed, on
21 February 2020, by a further notification of the notice of conclusion of the investigations pursuant to article
415-bis of the Italian Criminal Code.

Some days later, on 27 February 2020, the public prosecutor requested that the proceeding be filed with respect
to COCIV's position, under investigation for the alleged administrative crime as per article 25 of Legislative
decree no. 231/2001 given that the consortium had put in place a suitable and appropriate organisation model
as per Legislative decree no. 231/2001 before the alleged crimes took place and, moreover, the alleged crimes

were not performed to the advantage or in the interests of COCIV.

The filing request also covered some parties under investigation in the main proceeding in relation to numerous
additional alleged crimes charged to them during the investigation stage and found to be ungrounded (articles
416, 353, 353-bis, 319, 321 and 346-bis of the Italian Procedural Code and article 2635 of the Italian Civil Code).

Following the most recent notice as per article 415-bis of the Italian Criminal Code, it has been confirmed that
the investigation focuses on assumed collusive bidding and bribery, all of which took place quite some time ago
(2012 to 2016).
