The profit or loss from discontinued operations is disclosed separately in the statement of profit or loss. As
required by paragraph 34 of IFRS 5 - Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the

corresponding prior year figures are reclassified accordingly.
Revenue from contracts with customers

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised using the five-step model: (i) identify the contract with a
customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv)
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) recognise revenue when (or

as) the company satisfies a performance obligation.
More information is available in the “Contract assets and liabilities” paragraph of these notes.
Interest income

Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis, considering the principal and applicable effective interest
rate, i.e., the rate that discounts the estimated future inflows over the expected life of the financial asset to return

it to its carrying amount.

Dividends

Dividends are recognised when the investors’ right to receive payment arises in line with local ruling legislation.
Complex accounting estimates

Preparation of financial statements and the related notes in accordance with the IFRS requires management to
make judgements and estimates that affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and financial statements

disclosures. The estimates are used to:

e determine amortisation and depreciation (see the “Property, plant and machinery”, “Leased property, plant

and equipment”, and “Other intangible assets” paragraphs of the “ Accounting policies” section);

e recognise impairment losses (see the “Impairment of non-financial assets” paragraph of the “Accounting

policies” section);
e recognise employee benefits (see the “Employee benefits” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section);
e recognise taxes (see the “Income taxes” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section);

e recognise provisions for risks and charges (see the “Provisions for risks and charges” paragraph of the

“Accounting policies” section);

e determine total contract costs and the related stage of completion (see the “Contract assets and liabilities”
paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section). A significant part of the company’s activities is typically
performed on the basis of contracts which provide that a specific consideration is agreed when the contract
is awarded. This implies that the profits on these contracts may undergo change compared to the original
estimates depending on the recoverability of greater expenses and/or costs the company may incur during

performance of such contracts.
