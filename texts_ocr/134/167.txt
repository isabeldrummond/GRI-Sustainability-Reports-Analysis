Scope of the Statement

As established by article 4 of Legislative decree no. 254/2016, this Consolidated Non-financial Statement
includes the figures of the parent (Salini Impregilo S.p.A.) and its fully-consolidated subsidiaries. The parent
comprises its head offices in Italy (corporate), the directly run work sites, branches and joint operations for which

it manages their operations, as per the list provided later in this document.

The Company has an internal procedure in place to define and regularly review the scope of the Statement
based on its consolidation scope for financial reporting purposes. Specifically, it performs a materiality analysis
on the list of entities making up the parent and fully-comprised subsidiaries considering the level of operations

of the individual entities, which are classified as:

e operational (e.g., ongoing contracts);
e limited operations (e.g., contracts being completed);

e non-operational (e.g., entity in liquidation).

This Statement’s scope includes entities classified as “operational” and “limited operations”. A list of the entities
included in the 2019 Statement’s scope for which a non-financial reporting system was implemented is given
