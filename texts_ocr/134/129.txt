Internal policies

The Group’s Sustainability Strategy (see the related section for more information) defines Salini Impregilo’s
contribution to the SDGs established by the United Nations, including SDG 13 Climate action. The Company

offers its contribution through the projects it builds and its internal management policies.

Its projects in the sustainable mobility, clean hydro energy, clean water and green buildings areas all contribute

to the adaption and mitigation of climate change.

Specifically with respect to mitigation actions, the hydropower, sustainable mobility (railways and metros) and
green building contracts allow a reduction in the output of GHG emissions, in line with the global agenda to

transition towards a low-carbon economy.

The Group also carries out projects to reduce the impact of climate change. They include the desalination,
drinking water and water treatment projects performed by the group company Fisia Italimpianti mainly in areas
subject to water stress. The Group also has projects for water storage for drinking and/or irrigation and to make
urban wastewater management systems resilient to the increasingly frequent extreme weather events,

protecting areas affected by flooding and preventing the pollution of the receiving water bodies.

Again with respect to adaption to climate change, the Group leads the field with tailored systems to measure the
risk of climate change and its effect on infrastructure projects and the implementation of suitable strategies to
improve their resilience in the short, medium and long term. It has applied these systems successfully to projects
for metros, railways, hydraulic works, roads and civil buildings. It has received numerous external certifications
(e.g., LEED - Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, GSAS, Global Sustainability Assessment System

and IS) and international accolades for the design (if applicable) and construction of its projects.
