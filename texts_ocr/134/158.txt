Specifically, regulatory and contractual elements applicable to the project are analysed during this process and
the Company defines the Mobilisation programme which includes the main activities needed to start the project.

They include definition of the work schedule, which comprises, inter alia:
e the requirement plan for machinery, plant, subcontractors, third parties, materials and services;

e the mobilisation plan for managers, staff and blue collars.

The methods of managing relations with local stakeholders are defined in the contracts and the Group is obliged

to scrupulously abide by their provisions.

Employment created by the Group’s projects

The creation of jobs by the Group in the countries where it operates is important as it enables local personnel
to improve their skills and expertise and to generate additional wealth for the economy. This approach also

creates the opportunity for the Group to create a pool of qualified workers who can be used for future projects.

Some projects have special local personnel recruitment plans as provided for contractually, which may include

employment targets.

Specifically, 69% of the 24,526 direct employees were hired locally.

 

Direct employees hired locally Unit 2017 2018 2019
Africa % 95% 95% 96%
Europe % 86% 86% 84%
Americas % 97% 96% 96%
Asia and Oceania % 14% 21% 26%
Average % 70% 65% 69%

 

The Asia and Oceania area increased its average numbers but has the smallest percentage of local workers.
This is affected by the projects in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates), where
insufficient resources are available to perform the contracts making it necessary to bring in labour from other
countries. Reference should be made to the section on “Human rights” for information about the management

of migrant workers.

In 2019, local managers made up 70% of the total, reaching 88% in Europe and 76% in the Americas. In addition
to the direct workforce, the involvement of indirect personnel (mainly employees of subcontractors and service
providers) contributes significantly to the employment generated locally. Indirect workers involved in group
projects numbered 24,849 at 31 December 2019.

Local procurement

Purchases from suppliers resident in the countries where the Group operates are the main trigger to developing

ancillary industries (which is a direct contributor to GDP, public revenue and disposable income).

In 2019, the Group maintained a strong relationship with its local supplier chain, with roughly 94% of its

expenditure made with local suppliers.
