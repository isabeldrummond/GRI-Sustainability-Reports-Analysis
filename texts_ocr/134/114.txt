of the first in the domestic construction sector to have formalised a welfare agreement, despite the current

complexities faced by the sector due to the blocking of large public works which has not helped it.

During 2019, the Company continued to develop its welfare plan (“LIFE@salini-impregilo”), introduced on 19
July 2018, which supplements the traditional monetary incentives and benefits provided to an increasing number
of employees. In September 2019, a satisfaction survey was carried out with a 66% response rate, which was

very positive. More than 90% of the participants were in favour of the initiative.

The analysis and investigation approach is one of the pillars of design and implementation and will be repeated
in each year of the project to obtain a clear view of the beneficiaries to be involved in the plan and also what

type of services to offer.

Given the high satisfaction level received by the pilot project, the Company is evaluating new solutions to

incorporate the requests made by the employees in the monitoring survey in a sustainable manner.

The plan offers a flexible supplement to the employees’ remuneration packages giving them the option to
purchase social utility services using their personalised budget, which can be put towards the cost of education,
assistance for elderly family members, public transport passes, private healthcare, voluntary transfers to pension
plans and goods and services in kind. In addition and to assist employees achieve a good work-life balance, the

in-house services have been extended (they already include a launderette, pharmacy and shuttle service).

The journey to work can be very stressful in large cities and Salini Impregilo is convinced that mobility is one of
the main issues that a company dedicated to the welfare of its employees and protection of the environment

should manage as best it can.

As part of its focus on the requirements of individuals and environmental issues, the Company launched another
survey of the employees at the Milan and Rome offices for information on how they travel to work in order to

study possible solutions to make it easier and more sustainable for them.

This survey was the starting block for the construction of a new sustainable mobility plan which will be introduced
in 2020.
