Financial income decreased by approximately €9.9 million, mostly due to the smaller interest income accrued

on amounts due from foreign customers.

Net losses on equity investments amount to €37.8 million compared to net gains of €41.6 million in 2018. The
item includes impairment losses recognised to align the equity investments’ carrying amounts with the parent’s

share of the investees’ equity.
The 2018 balance included dividends of €153.3 million compared to €13.9 million in 2019.
