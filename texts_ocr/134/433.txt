The company recognised an impairment loss of €9.7 million as a result of the test.

In 2019, the company recognised an additional impairment loss on the investment in HCE Costruzioni S.p.A.
(€13.0 million, including its loss for the year).

Fisia Italimpianti recorded a loss of €11.3 million for 2019 and deficit of €1.6 million, compared to the investment’s
carrying amount of €46.2 million. Its order backlog approximated €178 million at the reporting date and principally

relates to contracts for water treatment plants in Argentina and Turkey.

Supported by independent experts who carried out an independent business review, the company tested its
investment in Fisia Italimpianti for impairment on the basis of the 2020-2024 business plan approved by the

subsidiary’s board of directors on 5 March 2020. No indicators of impairment were found.

Salini Impregilo used the unlevered version of the discounted cash flow method to calculate the investment’s

equity value. The main valuation parameters used were:
. long-term growth rate: 0% (0% in 2018);

. discount rate (WACC): 12.9% including 400 basis points as additional risk premium (2018: 11.8%,

including 200 basis points as additional risk premium).

The company also performed sensitivity analyses considering the possible effect of changes in the discount rate

(+/-0.5%). They did not identify any elements that would have required recognition of an impairment loss.

The directors adopted the following hypothetical assumptions in the 2020-2024 business plan, used to

extrapolate the expected future cash flows for impairment testing purposes:

- assumption about development of demand for projects: the subsidiary mainly operates in two business
segments, the desalination and water treatment plant segments. A programme for the construction of new plants
and partial replacement of the existing plants is underway worldwide, which makes the overall market outlook
and, therefore, the company’s development very promising. Large investment programmes have already been

approved confirming this trend, especially in the main market, the Middle East, and Saudi Arabia in particular;

- thanks to its global sales network, Salini Impregilo helped Fisia to identify its targets, especially in South
America, where it historically carries out its operations. Moreover, it may also support Fisia financially, providing

suitable guarantees where necessary.
