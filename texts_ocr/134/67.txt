Initial considerations on the comparability of management accounts
figures

The Group’s results for the 2019 are not fully comparable with those for the previous year as it has applied IFRS
16 - Leases using the modified retrospective approach. This has entailed the recognition of the cumulative effect
of FTA in retained earnings at 1 January 2019. For management account purposes only, the Group has
calculated adjusted figures that reflect the effect of IFRS 16 FTA as described below.

Financial highlights

The “Adjusted reclassified statement of profit or loss” and the “Adjusted net financial indebtedness” tables show

the Group’s adjusted key financial indicators for 2019 compared to the previous year.

Adjustments are not provided for by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the European Union. The Group deems that these
adjusted figures and data provide information useful to management and investors to assess the Group’s
performance and compare it to other companies active in the same sector. They also provide an additional

picture of the results.
As a result, the Group has adjusted its IFRS accounting figures to reflect the effects summarised below.
Joint ventures not controlled by Lane

The Group monitors the key figures of Lane Group for management purposes adjusting the IFRS figures
prepared for consolidation purposes to present the results of the non-subsidiary joint ventures consolidated on
a proportionate basis. These figures show the status of contracts managed directly by Lane or through non-

controlling investments in joint ventures.
Impairment - Venezuela

In the last three years, the Group has calculated the recoverable amount of its total exposure to Venezuelan
government agencies to reflect the negative developments caused by the deterioration in the country’s credit

standing.

The tests performed, including with the assistance of independent experts, showed that the exposure’s
recoverable amount was approximately €159.7 million at 31 December 2019, net of cumulative impairment

losses of €479.7 million.

At 31 December 2019, due to the developments of the year, the Group recognised another impairment loss of
€35.7 million to adjust the exposure’s recoverable amount. As a result, its net exposure amounts to €128.7

million, equal to 20% of the gross exposure’s nominal amount.
