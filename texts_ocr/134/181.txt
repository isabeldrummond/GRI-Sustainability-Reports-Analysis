Salini impregilo Group

Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us
to believe that the 2019 consolidated non-financial statement of the Salini Impregilo
Group has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the
requirements of articles 3 and 4 of the decree and the GRI Standards.
