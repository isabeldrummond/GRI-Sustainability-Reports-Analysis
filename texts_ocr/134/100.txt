The Company has an ISO 31000 compliant risk management system, certified by an independent expert. It
covers construction on its own behalf or for third parties of roads, ports, buildings, hydraulic, hydropower, railway

and other civil engineering works in Italy and abroad.

Salini Impregilo refers to the OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises and ISO 26000 “Guidance on Social
Responsibility" for its CSR issues. It has also adopted the UN’s Guiding principles on business and human rights

for the management of human rights.

Subsequent sections of this Statement provide more information on these frameworks.

Organisation, Management and Control Model
Salini Impregilo has introduced an Organisation, Management and Control model (the “231 model”) to:

e prevent the commission of the predicate crimes as per Legislative decree no. 231/2001;
e define and implement an internal culture based on respect and transparency;

e increase awareness among employees and stakeholders.

The Model sets out specific controls implemented in internal procedures in order to monitor transactions exposed

to the potential risk of crimes that would trigger the administrative liability of companies.

It includes measures to identify and reduce potential risks of non-compliance with the provisions of Legislative
decree no. 231/01. With respect to the risk of bribery crimes, the Model’s controls are aligned to the Anti-

corruption Compliance System.

The Integrity Board, which is an independent control body, monitors the effective implementation of and
compliance with the Model. The Company has informed its employees of an email and postal address for any
communications to be made directly to the Integrity Board, guaranteeing their anonymity and protection from
any form of reprisal. Notification of alleged violations of the Model can also be made using the whistleblowing

system (see the Anti-corruption section) which forwards them to the Integrity Board.

This complies with Law no. 179/2017 and Confindustria’s Explanatory Note dated January 2018.

Non-financial reporting system

Salini Impregilo has a non-financial reporting system that complies with the requirements of Legislative decree
no. 254/2016 and the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards. The Corporate Social Responsibility Department
supervises this reporting system. This Statement is approved by the Company’s Board of Directors after it has

been examined by the Control, Risk and Sustainability Committee.

Main organisational changes

Salini Impregilo revised parts of its organisation during the year to ensure more effective controls over its internal

processes.
