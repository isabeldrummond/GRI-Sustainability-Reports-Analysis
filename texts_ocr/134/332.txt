appeal in the hearing of 14 January 2019 with its ruling of 12 February 2019. The tax authorities appealed
this ruling on 11 September 2019 and the appeal still has to be allocated to the relevant section of the

court;

with respect to another dispute again related to 2005 and the costs of a joint venture set up in Venezuela
for which the greater assessed tax base is €6.6 million, the Regional Tax Commission filed its ruling
entirely in the parent’s favour on 19 May 2015; the tax authorities appealed to the Supreme Court on 28
December 2015 challenging the procedure while stating that the findings do not relate to the appeal. The
parent has filed its defence brief. The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not yet

been filed;

the parent was notified of: (i) a payment order from the tax authorities for Icelandic taxes of €4.6 million,
which was cancelled after the first and second level sentences in its favour; the tax authorities appealed
to the Supreme Court on 11 May 2017 and the parent presented its defence brief, and (ii) a payment bill
for the same taxes which the parent appealed. It won again both at first and second level. On 18 January
2016, the tax authorities presented their appeal to the Supreme Court and the parent filed its defence

brief. The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not yet been filed;

on 12 December 2017, the parent and the subsidiary Imprepar received an adjustment notice from the
tax authorities requesting payment of registration tax of approximately €1.3 million in addition to a fine of
the same amount on the sale of a business unit to Imprepar (which also received an identical adjustment
notice). This business unit had no future profits and held investments in consortium companies in
liquidation or inactive and the related assets and liabilities related to contracts that have been completed
or are nearing completion due to Imprepar’s know how in managing this type of business. The parent
deems that the tax authorities’ allegations are ungrounded and has promptly appealed against the notices
to the competent tax commission. The dispute was settled with a court-ordered settlement procedure as
per article 48 of Legislative decree no. 546/1992 as proposed by the tax authorities. This included a
reduction in the registration tax and the fine from €1.3 million to €204 thousand and from €1.3 million to

€82 thousand, respectively;

in August 2019, the Ethiopian branch’s tax assessment of 2014, 2015 and 2016 was completed. During
the preliminary stage of the assessment procedure, the branch met the tax authorities and agreed to settle
all the assessed taxes for the three years by paying an amount in local currency equal to roughly €32.5

million (taxes, interest and fines) and the tax authorities cancelled the administrative sanctions;

on 23 December 2019, the parent received an assessment notice for assessed IRES tax for 2014 of €1.2
million (plus fines and interest). The notice refers to: (i) for a minimum part, the alleged incorrect
application of transfer pricing rules to sureties provided free of charge on behalf of foreign subsidiaries,
on which it should allegedly have charged commissions of €741 thousand; (ii) the alleged undue deduction
of the “ACE relief’ (Aid for Economic Growth) of €3,450 thousand contrary to the provisions of article 10
of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance’s decree of 14 March 2012. At the date of preparation of this

Annual Report, the deadline for presentation of an appeal has not expired.
