Specifically and as disclosed in note 7 (to which reference should be made), the provision for risks on equity
investments includes the impairment losses on investments in certain SPEs for the part that exceeds their

carrying amounts. Changes are due to:

- capital transactions of €16.7 million mainly relating to Salini Polska L.t.d. Liability Co, Salini Australia

Pty Ltd and Salini Impregilo Salini Insaat Jv;

- impairment losses of €21.7 million chiefly attributable to HCE Costruzioni (€13 million), Salini Polska
L.t.d. Liability Co (€2.9 million), Salini Australia PTY L.t.d. (€2.3 million), Construtora Impregilo y
Associados S.A.-CIGLA S.A (€1.1 million) and INC - Il Nuovo Castoro Algerie S.a.r.I (€1.0 million);

-  reclassifications of €11.7 million relating to HCE, since, in 2019, the company recognised an additional
impairment loss on its investment in HCE Costruzioni S.p.A. (€13.0 million, including its loss for the

year).
