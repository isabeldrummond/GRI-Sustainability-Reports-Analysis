infrastructure sector and Salini Impregilo’s role”.

Main risks and management methods

The main environmental risks arising from the Company’s activities relate to non-compliance with applicable
environmental legislation, compromising one or more environmental components (e.g., the soil, water or air) due
to a mistaken assessment of the risk or ineffective management/mitigation activities, inefficient use of natural

resources and the failure to obtain/maintain environmental certifications and ratings.

The main environmental risks facing the Company (generated by external factors) arise from changes in the
applicable environmental legislation, the inconsistent interpretation of applicable legislation by the competent
local authorities, incomplete and/or insufficient environmental impact assessments for projects (which should be
performed by the client) or adverse environmental or geological conditions (e.g., extreme weather events, actual

conditions differing from those anticipated during the tender procedure).

To monitor these risks, Salini Impregilo has an environmental management system, which complies with the

ISO 14001 standard and has been certified by an independent certification body.

To ensure that the significant environmental impacts are properly identified, managed and mitigated, the system
incorporates a number of environmental management procedures that have to be implemented by the Group’s

production companies, after being revised to comply with the applicable regulations or contracts.

When contractually provided for, the Group’s contracts may include additional environmental management

standards that require special certifications or ratings. They may be:

e system standards, which involve reaching specific environmental performance targets during
construction activities (e.g., lower emissions, waste recycling);
e product standards, which require the completed works to meet specific environmental performance

targets (e.g., use of low impact construction materials, energy-efficient buildings).

Ongoing projects affected by these standards include the Red line North Underground in Doha and the Al Bayt
Stadium in Qatar which use the GSAS (Global Sustainability Assessment System), two stations of Line 3 of the
Riyadh metro in Saudi Arabia and Eni’s new offices in Italy which use the LEED standard, the Meydan One Mall,
Dubai project which uses the Green Buildings Regulations and Specification standard and the Forrestfield-

Airport Link in Perth, Australia which uses the IS (Infrastructure Sustainability) system.

During 2019, Salini Impregilo took part in the pilot stage of the “Level(s)” project promoted by the European
Commission as the future reference framework for green buildings in the EU. Specifically, the Company trialled

the framework’s application in its project to build Eni’s headquarters in Italy as one of the first to use this tool. It
