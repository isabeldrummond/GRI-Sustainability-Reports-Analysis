Final assessment of the supervisory activities

and proposal to the shareholders

Based on that set out above, during the year:

- we monitored compliance with the law and bylaws, the principles of correct administration and,
specifically, the adequacy of the organisational, administrative and accounting models adopted by the
company and their correct working;

—- we monitored compliance with the disclosure requirements about confidential information;

- we monitored the working and efficiency of the internal controls and administrative-accounting
system in order to assess their compliance with the company’s requirements and reliability in
presenting its operations;

—- we monitored compliance with the laws about the preparation, checks, approval and publication of the
company’s separate financial statements and the preparation, checks and publication of the Group’s
consolidated financial statements and the directors’ reports for 2019, including through direct checks
and information obtained from the independent auditors, assessing the appropriateness of the
impairment method;

— we checked that, pursuant to Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 and Legislative decree no. 38/2005, the
separate financial statements of Salini Impregilo S.p.A. and the consolidated financial statements of
Salini Impregilo Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019 were prepared in compliance
with the IFRS endorsed by the European Commission and integrated by the interpretations issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);

- we monitored compliance with the procedure for preparation and presentation of the separate financial
statements to the shareholders;

- we monitored the financial reporting process, the effectiveness of internal controls, internal audit and
risk management pursuant to article 19.1 of Legislative decree no. 39/2010 and informed the board of
directors of the findings of the statutory audit;

— we monitored compliance with the measures of Legislative decree no. 254/2016 and Consob regulation
no. 20267/2018, checking, inter alia, the Consolidated Non-financial Statement and compliance with
the instructions for its preparation pursuant to the above decree and its preparation in accordance with
the measures. We checked the board of directors’ approval of the Consolidated Non-financial Statement
on 11 March 2020 and the expression by the independent auditors on 10 April 2020 of a conclusion
about the compliance of the information in such statement with the requirements of articles 3 and 4 of
Legislative decree no. 254/2016.

That being said, no reprehensible behaviour, omissions or irregularities were noted during our work that
would require communication to the competent bodies.

As a result, we invite the shareholders to approve the separate financial statements as at and for the year
ended 31 December 2019 presented to you by the board of directors together with its report and proposal.
