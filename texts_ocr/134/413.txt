7. Presentation in the separate financial statements

 

The statement of financial position includes “Contract costs” under intangible assets which includes the costs
capitalised under the criteria described in point 6 of this section. Amortisation of these costs is included in the

statement of profit or loss item “Amortisation, depreciation and provisions”.

Contract assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position items “Contract assets” and
“Contract liabilities”, respectively under assets and liabilities. The classification in line with IFRS 15 depends
on the relationship between the company’s performance obligation and payment by the customer. These items

show the sum of the following components analysed individually for each customer:

(+) Amount of work performed calculated using the cost-to-cost method pursuant to IFRS 15
(-) Progress payments and advances received

(-) Contractual advances.

When the total is positive, the net balance is recognised as a "Contract asset". If it is negative, it is recognised
as a "Contract liability". When the amounts represent an unconditional right to payment of the consideration,

they are recognised as financial assets.

The company’s statement of profit or loss includes a revenue item “Revenue from contracts with customers” to
comply with IFRS 15. This revenue is presented and measured in accordance with the new standard. The item
“Other income” includes income from transactions other than contracts with customers and is measured in line
with other standards or the company’s specific accounting policy elections. It includes income related to gains
on the sale of non-current assets, income on cost recharges, prior year income and income from the recharging

of costs of Italian consortia and consortium companies.

With respect to the last item, the company’s activities involve its participation in numerous SPEs that, especially
in Italy, use the consortium structure, which works using a cost recharging system. Under IFRS 10 and IFRS
11, these entities have been classified as subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. As this income does not

arise on the performance of the contract obligations or contract negotiations, it is recognised as “Other income’.
Real estate projects

Closing inventories of real estate projects are those real estate areas developed with a view to selling them.
They are measured at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value. Costs incurred consist of the
consideration paid for purchasing the areas and related charges, construction costs and borrowing costs related

to the project up to and not exceeding its completion.
Financial instruments

Financial assets, which are debt instruments, are classified in the following three categories depending on the

instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model for managing them:
