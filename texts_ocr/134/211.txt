Outlook

As part of the project to relaunch the infrastructure sector in Italy, to consolidate its position and avail of the
related investment opportunities, the parent will draw up a three-year business plan in 2020 underpinned by

strategic pillars:

e¢ Completion of Progetto Italia: creation of a larger group (Webuild) to shore up Italy's large infrastructure
works sector. The new player will be more efficient thanks to economies of scale and more competitive

as a result of the aggregation of specialist skills and greater financial solidity and flexibility;

e Geographical focus: greater share of key geographical areas such as North America, Australia and the

Middle East and growth in new high potential areas like Europe and the Scandinavian countries;

e Sector focus: concentration of complex infrastructure projects where the Group can capitalise on its

best-in-class expertise in the sustainability mobility, clean hydro energy and clean water areas;

e Continuation of the cost streamlining process: optimisation of overheads and achievement of greater
operating efficiency through the centralisation of internal functions (procurement, plant and machinery,

human resources, finance and communications) and cost synergies from these integrations.

The plan, which may evolve and change thanks to the internal ethical work practices based on the principles of
sustainable development, is designed to create a group that is attractive to all stakeholders, such as its
employees, project partners and investors. It is innovative, efficient and structured to generate interest in the

industrial and financial markets.

In 2020, the Group expects to have a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x, high-single-digit revenue growth and an EBITDA

margin in the range of between 7% to 7.5%. These expectations reflect its current business scope.

They do not include the impact that the ongoing development of COVID-19 (described in the “Events after the
reporting date” section) may have on business dynamics. The Group will ensure the continuity of operations at
its work sites in Italy and abroad as far as possible in line with government measures and prioritising the health

of its stakeholders.
