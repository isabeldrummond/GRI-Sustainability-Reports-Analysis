The parent set up the national tax consolidation system pursuant to article 117 and subsequent articles of
Presidential decree no. 917/86 on 1 January 2004. In 2019, 11 of the parent’s Italian subsidiaries joined the

system, which is regulated by the specific consolidation mechanisms.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the basis of the temporary differences between the tax
base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the statement of financial position. Deferred tax assets

are recognised when the Group holds their recovery to be probable.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and, to the extent necessary, is
decreased when it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to use all or
part of the related benefit.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted
at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities, respectively, and are
netted at company level if related to taxes that may be offset. If the balance is positive, it is recognised as

“Deferred tax assets”, if not, as “Deferred tax liabilities”.

Taxes that could arise from the transfer of undistributed profits by subsidiaries are only calculated when the

subsidiary has the positive intention to transfer such profits.

In the case of transactions recognised directly in equity, the related deferred tax asset or liability also affects

equity.
Provisions for risks and charges

In accordance with IAS 37, the Group makes accruals to provisions for risks and charges when the following

conditions exist:

e the Group or a group company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) at the reporting date as a
result of a past event where an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to

settle the obligation;
e itis probable that the obligation (through an outflow of resources) will have to be settled;
e areliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

When the time value is material and the obligation payment dates can be estimated reliably, the amount
recognised as the provision equals the pre-tax future cash flows (i.e., forecast outflows) discounted at a rate

that reflects the present market value and risks specific to the liability.
The increase in the provision due to discounting is recognised as a financial expense.

When the expected cash flows are included in an estimate range with the same probability of occurrence, the

median value is discounted to measure the liability.

Provision for restructuring costs is recognised when the parent or relevant group company has approved a

detailed formal plan that has been implemented and communicated to the third parties involved.
