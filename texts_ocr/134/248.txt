Impairment losses on financial assets

The company tests the recoverable amount of debt instruments not measured at fair value through profit or
loss using the expected credit loss model. This model develops estimates of the impact of changes in economic

factors on the expected credit losses using a probability-weighted outcome.

The Group found that, given the characteristics of its business sector, credit risk is that deriving from its
exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ (which are mostly governments or state bodies) non-

compliance with their obligations.

Management of this risk is complex, starting as early as the assessment of offers, through a careful analysis
of the characteristics of the countries in which the Group's activities should be carried out and the customers,

which are usually state or similar bodies, requesting an offer.

Therefore, this risk can be essentially assimilated to the country risk. An analysis of this risk based on the age
of the outstanding amounts is not very meaningful, since the receivables should be assessed together with the
related working capital items, especially those reflecting the net exposure to customers in relation to contract

work in progress as a whole.
Loans and borrowings and bonds

Loans and borrowings and bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration

received less transaction costs.

After initial recognition, loans are measured at amortised cost, whereby repayments are determined using the
effective interest method with a rate which matches, at initial recognition, the expected cash flows with the

initial carrying amount.

Loan transaction costs are classified under liabilities decreasing the loan; amortised cost is calculated

considering these costs and any discounts or premiums expected at settlement.

The effects arising from the recognition at amortised cost are taken to “Financing income (costs)”.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities

(a) Financial assets

A financial asset (or, where applicable, part of a financial asset or parts of a group of similar financial assets)

is derecognised when:
(i) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;

(ii) | the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a

contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in full and immediately;

(iii) | the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset and has transferred

substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and the related control.

When the Group has transferred the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset and has

neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards or has retained control, it continues to
