Our audit procedures included:

Key audit matter

The consolidated financial statements at 31
December 2019 include contract assets,

trade receivables and non-current financial
assets of €204.5 million, €318.7 million and

include total impairment losses of €514.7

million relating to those assets, €35.7 million

of which recognised in profit or loss in 2019.

For the above reasons, we believe that the
estimate of the recoverable amount of
contract assets, trade receivables and non-
current financial assets relating to projects
carried out in Venezuela is a key audit
matter.
