Therefore, this risk can be essentially assimilated to the country risk. An analysis of this risk based on the age
of the outstanding amounts is not very meaningful, since the receivables should be assessed together with the
related working capital items, especially those reflecting the net exposure to customers in relation to contract
work in progress as a whole.

Loans and borrowings and bonds

Loans and borrowings and bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration

received less transaction costs.

After initial recognition, loans are measured at amortised cost, whereby repayments are determined using the
effective interest method with a rate which matches, at initial recognition, the expected cash flows with the

initial carrying amount.

Loan transaction costs are classified under liabilities decreasing the loan; amortised cost is calculated

considering these costs and any discounts or premiums expected at settlement.

The effects arising from the recognition at amortised cost are taken to “Financing income (costs)”.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities

(a) Financial assets

A financial asset (or, where applicable, part of a financial asset or parts of a group of similar financial assets) is

derecognised when:
. the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;

. the company retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes

a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in full and immediately;

. the company transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset and has transferred

substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and the related control.

When the company has transferred the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset and
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards or has retained control, it continues
to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes
the form of guaranteeing the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the initial carrying amount of the asset

and the maximum amount of the consideration that the company could be required to pay.
(b) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the underlying obligation is extinguished, cancelled or settled.

When an existing financial liability is exchanged with another by the same lender at substantially different terms,
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, this exchange or modification is treated as an
extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference

between the carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.
