Impairment of financial assets

If there is any indication that a financial asset is impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to

determine the amount of the impairment loss.
Derivatives and hedging transactions

Salini Impregilo has derivatives recognised at fair value when the related agreement is signed and for
subsequent fair value changes. The treatment of the related fair value gains or losses changes depending on

whether the conditions for hedge accounting are met, as described below.

The company has derivatives to hedge currency and financial risks. At the inception of the transaction, it
documents the hedging relationship, its risk management and strategy objectives in entering into the transaction,
the hedging instrument and hedged item or transaction and the nature of the hedged risk. Moreover, at the
inception of the transaction, and thereafter on an ongoing basis, the company documents whether or not the
hedge meets the effectiveness requirements to offset its exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged

item or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.

“Hedging purposes” are assessed considering risk management objectives. When they do not meet the
requirements of IFRS 9 for hedge accounting, the derivatives are classified as “Financial assets or financial

liabilities at fair value through profit or loss”.
Employee benefits
Post-employment benefits

Post-employment benefits are recognised at the present value of the company’s liability determined in line with
ruling legislation and national and in-house labour agreements. The valuation, based on demographic, financial
and turnover assumptions, is carried out by independent actuaries. The gains and losses resulting from the
actuarial calculation are recognised in profit or loss if related to service costs and interest expense or in

comprehensive income if relating to assets and liabilities.

The 2007 Finance Act and related implementing decrees introduced significant changes to legislation governing
Italian post-employment benefits, effective as from 1 January 2007. These include the option given to
employees, to be exercised before 30 June 2007, of where to allocate their future benefits. Specifically,
employees can opt to allocate them to selected pension funds or maintain them with the company, in which

case, the latter shall pay the contributions to the treasury fund of INPS (the Italian social security institution).

Following these changes, the Italian post-employment benefits accruing after the date of the employees
decision and, in any case, after 30 June 2007, are considered part of a defined contribution plan and treated

like all other social security contributions.
Share-based payments

Share-based payments are measured at fair value of the option at the grant date. This amount is recognised in

the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This treatment is based on an
