- Interest on bonds (45,703)
- Bank interest on accounts and financing (18,924) (7,165)
- Other (11,176) 587
- Interest on tax liabilities (1,605) (12,119)
- Bank fees (2,881) (190)
- Leases (1,223) (860)
Total (95,601) (23,443)

The rise in financial expense is mostly due to the assessment of loan assets at the reporting date, pursuant to
IFRS 9, payment of interest of €13.7 million by the Ethiopian branch for the years from 2014 to 2016 as part of
a tax assessment and the increase in bank interest on accounts and financing of €7.2 million. This increase is
partly offset by the reduction in financial expense on the bonds of approximately €10.7 million compared to the

previous year following the redemption of the unsecured senior bonds in August 2018.
In addition:

- interest on bank accounts and financing of €26.1 million includes the effect of the amortised cost method

of €1.1 million (2018: €2.0 million) that did not give rise to cash outlays;

- _ interest on bonds of €35.0 million includes the effect of the amortised cost method of €3.7 million (2018:

€4.3 million) that did not give rise to cash outlays.

Intragroup interest and other expense of €28.5 million on intragroup transactions increased by €14.4 million and

31.3 Net exchange gains
Net exchange gains decreased from €31.3 million in 2018 to €5.4 million in 2019.

The 2019 decrease of €25.9 million is due to fluctuations in the exchange rate with certain currencies, especially

the Ethiopian Birr.
