Net invested capital

This item increased by €343.9 million on the previous year end to €2,135.6 million at 31 December 2019. The

main changes are due to the factors listed below.
Non-current assets

Non-current assets increased by €151.7 million. They may be analysed as follows:

(€'000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation

 

 

Property, plant and equipment 415,941 333,511 (82,430)
Right-of-use assets - 144,184 144,184
Equity investments 538,257 642,486 104,229
Total non-current assets 1,153,554 1,305,277 151,723

 

Property, plant and equipment decreased by €82.4 million, mostly as a result of:

-  reclassifications of items, mainly plant and machinery, to right-of-use assets of €79.7 million;

- depreciation for the year of €92.9 million; partly offset by

- investments of €85.4 million, mostly for Lane Group’s contracts and the new Snowy 2.0 project in Australia.

Following the application of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, the Group has recognised right-of-use assets of €144.2
million at 31 December 2019, including €79.7 million classified under property, plant and equipment at 31

December 2018. These assets mainly consist of plant and machinery and buildings.
Intangible assets show a net decrease of €14.3 million mainly due to amortisation.

The €104.2 million net change in equity investments is due to the increase of €135.3 million in the Grupo Unidos

Por el Canal investment after payments made during the year.

Net non-current assets held for sale

Net non-current assets held for sale at 31 December 2019 amount to €12.0 million and comprise the net assets
of the USW Campania projects and the investment on Consorcio Agua Azual S.A. held by Impregilo International
Infrastructures N.V.. It was reclassified to non-current assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 at 31

December 2019 as a result of its sale at the start of 2020.

Provisions for risks

These provisions of €137.9 million increased by €53.7 million over 31 December 2018, mainly due to the losses

of the equity-accounted investees of Lane Group (mostly the joint venture working on the I-4 Ultimate project).
