the Tuscan lots of the “Valico variation”.

The Ministry of the Environment joined the criminal proceedings as a civil party, sueing Autostrade per I'Italia
S.p.A., Todini C.G. S.p.A., Impresa S.p.A. and Toto S.p.A. for their civil liability and quantifying the alleged
environmental damage to be compensated as “not /ess than €810,000,000.00 or any amount that may be
established during the proceedings and/or established in an equitable manner’. As evidence of the damage, the

Ministry presented a preliminary report prepared by I.S.P.R.A. (a body which is part of the Ministry).

The judge held that the I.S.P.R.A. report was not a document that could be used in the proceedings as it had
not been prepared inter partes and, moreover, did not include the name of the individual that had physically
prepared it. At the date of preparation of this report, the claim for compensation is not supported by proof about

its size.

On 30 October 2017, the Florence Court found all the defendants not guilty and the public prosecutor appealed
the ruling on 20 June 2019.

For completeness purposes, after the claim for compensation presented by the Ministry of the Environment, the
Group commissioned a report on the possible effect of the criminal proceeding on the consolidated financial
statements. The opinion was that the Ministry’s joining the proceedings as a civil party did not require any

provision to be made in the separate or consolidated financial statements or the interim financial statements.

The Group is confident that the claim for compensation will not be accepted.
