The following paragraphs describe the elements presented in the above chart.

Raw materials

Construction of motorways, bridges, dams, railway and metro lines and civil and industrial buildings requires the
use of large quantities of water, aggregates, iron, cement and backfill: all raw materials which are mostly not

renewable.

The environmental assessments made at the start of a new contract consider these aspects and the related
mitigation measures are designed to ensure the efficient management of these resources and, when possible,
the use of alternative materials, such as recycled materials, without reducing the quality, performance, security

and functioning of the asset. The main raw materials used are shown in the following table:

The main variations on the previous year relate to the sale of Lane’s Plants & Paving Division in the US and the
stage of completion of the Group’s projects. Specifically, the reduction in aggregates and bitumen is mostly due
to this sale. The decrease in aggregates is also due to progress on the projects of Salini Polska (Poland) and
the GERD project in Ethiopia. The reduction in concrete is mainly a result of progress on the Riyadh Metro
(Saudi Arabia), Meydan One Mall (UAE) projects and those of Lane (USA) while the decrease in the use of
asphalt is due to progress on the projects of Salini Polska (Poland) and the reduction in the utilisation of

reinforcing bars reflects the progress on Lane’s projects (USA).

With respect to water resources, the increase in withdrawals from wells is due to the greater use by the South
Al Mutlaa (Kuwait) and COCIV (Italy) projects while the reduction in withdrawals from rivers is mostly attributable
to the progress on the GERD and Koysha projects in Ethiopia. There were no withdrawals from lakes in 2019

which is entirely related to Lane’s projects (USA) and, specifically, the sale of its Plants & Paving Division.
