11. Contract assets and liabilities

Contract assets and liabilities can be analysed as follows:

(€000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation

 

Contract assets 717,156 1,230,111 512,955

 

 

Contract assets mostly represent the right to consideration for work performed but not invoiced at the reporting
date, net of contract advances. They were impaired by €11.5 million at 31 December 2019 (€48.4 million), mainly
in relation to the contract assets with the Venezuelan customers (see the "Main risk factors and uncertainties"

section of the Directors’ report).

Revenue recognised in 2019 on performance obligations satisfied (or partly satisfied) mostly relates to changes

in estimates of the percentage of completion and the variable consideration.
Contract liabilities mostly comprise contract advances from customers for projects for which the revenue is
recognised over time.
