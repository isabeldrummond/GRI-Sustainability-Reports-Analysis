Main risk factors and uncertainties

In addition to the areas outlined in the “Business risk management” section above, the following specific
situations linked to major outstanding disputes, country risk exposure and situations characterised by risk and/or
uncertainty profiles at 31 December 2019, should be added to the universe of risk events that may potentially

impact on operations.

Civil litigation
USW Campania projects

The Group became involved in the urban solid waste disposal projects in the Province of Naples and other

provinces in Campania at the end of the 1990’s through its subsidiaries Fibe and Fibe Campania.

The major issues that have characterised the Group’s activities in service contracts since 1999-2000, which
have been discussed in detail and reviewed in all of the reports published by the Group starting from that time,
have evolved and became more complex over the years, giving rise to a large range of disputes, some of which
are major and in part still ongoing. Even given the positive developments, the general situation in terms of
pending disputes is still very complex. A brief overview is provided below, especially in relation to existing risk

positions.

Since Fibe Campania S.p.A. was merged into Fibe S.p.A. in 2009, unless otherwise stated, reference is made
exclusively to Fibe S.p.A. in the rest of this section, even with regard to positions and events that affected the

merged company.

The USW Campania issue comprises various proceedings in different jurisdictions and pending at different court

levels. The main aspects of the key civil, administrative and criminal proceedings are described below.
Civil proceedings

1. In May 2005, the government commissioner filed a motion requesting compensation from Fibe S.p.A. (“Fibe”)
and FISIA Italimpianti S.p.A. (now FISIA Ambiente S.p.A., “Fisia Ambiente”) for alleged damage of about €43
million. During the hearing, the commissioner increased its claims to approximately €700 million, further to
the additional claim for damage to its reputation, calculated to be €1,000 million. The companies appeared
before the court and, in addition to disputing the claims made by the government commissioner, filed a
counterclaim requesting compensation for damage due to contract default and sundry expenses for over
€650 million, plus a further claim for reputation damage quantified at €1.5 billion. In the same proceeding,
the banks that issued Fibe and Fibe Campania S.p.A.’s (“Fibe Campania”) performance bonds to the
government commissioner also requested the commissioner’s claim be dismissed and, in any case, to be
held harmless by Salini Impregilo (at the time, Impregilo), which appeared before the court and disputed the
bank’s requests. In ruling no. 4253/2011, the judge declared their lack of jurisdiction referring the case to the
administrative judge. The attorney general filed an appeal which was rejected on 14 February 2019 and the

first level ruling was upheld.
