Since they mainly relate to consortia and consortium companies of which the Group holds less than 20%, in

accordance with IFRS 9, such investments are stated as non-current assets.

Dividend income from such financial instruments is recognised in profit or loss under financial income when

the group companies holding the investments are given the right to such dividend.
Financial instruments
Financial assets — Debt instruments

Financial assets, which are debt instruments, are classified in the following three categories depending on the

instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model for managing them:
(i) financial assets at amortised cost;

(ii) financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI);

(iii) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant

financing component are measured at their transaction price.

After initial recognition, financial assets that generate contractual cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are measured at amortised cost if they are held
within a business model whose objective is to hold them in order to collect contractual cash flows (hold to
collect business model). Under the amortised cost method, the financial assets’ amount at initial recognition is
decreased by principal repayments, any loss allowance and cumulated amortisation of the difference between

that initial amount and the maturity amount.

Amortisation is calculated using the effective interest rate that exactly discounts the expected future cash flows

to their initial carrying amount.

Loans and receivables and other financial assets at amortised cost are recognised net of the related loss

allowance.

Debt instruments held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows and sell
financial assets (hold to collect and sell model) are measured at fair value through other comprehensive
income. Fair value gains and losses on these financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income
(OCI). The cumulative fair value gains and losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss
when the financial asset is derecognised. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method,

exchange differences and impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.

Debt instruments that are not measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at fair value through profit

or loss.

Financial assets that are transferred are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the

financial asset expire or are transferred to third parties.
