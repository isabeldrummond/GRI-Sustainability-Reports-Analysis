Contracts agreed by the Company with Third Parties must include specific measures to ensure their compliance

with Anti-corruption laws, the Company’s Code of Ethics and Anti-corruption Model.

Salini Impregilo also has a whistleblowing system that can be accessed through an external web portal. This
allows employees to make anonymous or confidential (at their own discretion) notifications about potential
violations while being protected against any form of reprisal, discrimination or unfair treatment. The Anti-
corruption Model provides that employees are obliged to report any violations of the Model and/or internal or
external regulations, the ethical principles and all anti-corruption laws by the Company, a colleague, a consultant
or third party. As of 2018, third parties (e.g., suppliers, subcontractors) can also use the whistleblowing system.
Alternatively, notifications can be made by post or email. The Company guarantees the protection of the notifying
person in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 179/2017 and Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 on personal

data protection.

Violations of the Anti-corruption Model's principles and measures are a serious breach of their contracts by
employees and consultants. Salini Impregilo takes all the steps provided for by the existing laws and contracts
in the case of these violations, including conservative disciplinary measures, dismissal, termination of the

contractual relationship, claims for compensation, etc..

In 2019, the Company received seven notifications through its whistleblowing channels, of which only one for
the potential violations of its anti-corruption procedures. In all cases, the Compliance Unit commenced an
investigation assisted by either the Internal Audit Unit or the Legal Unit based on the Company’s internal
procedures. During the year, corrective actions were taken involving employees and suppliers, which included

the termination of relationships with the Company.

The Company requires that all new employees receive the mandatory Anti-corruption training as part of a wider
programme about Compliance. In 2019, the Company prepared a training course on relationships with
multilateral investment banks and export credit agencies as well as practices that they condone and sanction.
Italian and foreign employees who carry out activities related to the issues regulated by these bodies attended
this course. The Company also promoted courses on ethics and anti-corruption for contracts where it manages
the operating activities: in 2019, the employees of Isarco Scarl (Italy), Salini Impregilo-Healy Company-Jose
Chediak UTE (Argentina), PerGenova Scpa (Italy) and Fisia Italimpianti S.p.A. (Italy) all received training. Given
the importance of training courses to guide its employees’ conduct, the Company plans to launch a new training
programme in 2020 covering the understanding of virtuous conduct to foster an ethical culture, especially as

regards the encouragement of reporting possible violations.

The Compliance Unit also prepares internal reports for the Board of Directors (every six months), which it

addresses to the Control, Risk and Sustainability Committee, as well as ad hoc communications and reports to
