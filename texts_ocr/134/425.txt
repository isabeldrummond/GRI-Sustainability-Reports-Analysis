Further to the resolutions of 19 December 2019, the consortium’s membership structure in relation to the rights

and obligations resulting from the contract with RFI is as follows:

Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 97.753%
Civ S.p.A. (“Civ”), in which Salini Impregilo has a 85% investment 7.246%
Societa Italiana per Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A. (“Condotte”) 0.001%

The increase in Salini Impregilo’s ideal interests in the contract (held by COCIV) resulting from the reallocation
of Condotte’s interest led to a rise in the carrying amount of contract assets relating to the COCIV contract of

€99.7 million recognised as revenue from contracts with customers in profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 15.
