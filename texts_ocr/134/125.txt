Specifically, the indicators used to measure country risk were used for this risk assessment**. The department
developed a risk measurement method based on the Company’s existing project risk assessment tools to

measure the risks associated with the work carried out directly or subcontracted.
The main risks identified and related management methods are summarised below.

The main risks with respect to forced or compulsory labour are tied to the hiring of migrant workers, mainly in
the certain states of the Persian Gulf (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait) where the

local labour force is insufficient and/or inadequate for the Group’s needs. Specifically, there are two risk factors:

e use of recruitment agencies that may adopt incorrect practices, such as obliging the workers to pay
recruitment fees (when hired), employment fees (throughout their employment) and cash deposits which
are forms of debt (debt bondage);

e labour conditions that may limit the migrant workers’ freedom of movement which are in some cases
allowed or facilitated by local regulations, such as the ban on leaving their accommodation outside work
hours, limitations on holiday arrangements, resignations and changes of employer.

The Group ensures that candidates for work in these countries are provided with exhaustive information about
the contractual terms and work conditions in their own language before they leave their country of origin. In
addition, the Group fully bears the costs of recruitment, travel, visas, medical visits, etc.. Migrant workers are
guaranteed the possibility to change jobs and to leave their destination country without prejudice to the possible
notice obligation imposed by the applicable legislation, visa requirements and employment contracts. No
workers are deprived of their identity documents unless this has been authorised by them and solely for their
safekeeping. The Group requires the recruitment agencies to comply with these principles through specific

contractual clauses and non-compliance entails termination of the contracts.

With respect to child labour, the potential risk of hiring people under the minimum working age established by
the applicable local regulations is minimal as is the risk that workers who are above the legal minimum but are
less than 18 years old may be hired. In this respect and irrespective of the local regulations, the Group only
agrees employment contracts with people who are 18 years old. In countries, where the presence of false identity
documents is rife, the Group has special procedures in place to check the authenticity of the documents,

especially driving licences, assisted by the local authorities.

With respect to the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the Group ensures its employees have
access to “alternative systems” for dialogue in the states of the Persian Gulf where the right to the freedom of

association is restricted by law. These systems include worker committees, committees set up in the camps and

Index rates.
