Contract assets and liabilities, comprising progress payments and advances, include claims for additional
consideration of €855.9 million and €26.3 million, respectively, which is recognised to the extent that its collection
is deemed highly probable, based also on the legal and technical opinions of the company’s advisors. The
additional consideration recognised in this item is part of the total consideration formally requested of the

customers.

The section on the “Performance by geographical area” of the Directors’ report provides more details about the
contracts and the progress made on the main contracts while a description of the pending disputes and assets
deemed to be exposed to “country risk” is provided in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the

Directors’ report.

12. Trade receivables

Trade receivables amount to €1,505.7 million (€1,420.4 million), of which €1,117.9 million (€715.3 million) from

group companies and other related parties.

This item may be analysed as follows:

 

 

(€'000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation
Third parties 705,086 387,773 (317,314)
Group companies and other related parties 715,301 1,117,884 402,583
Total 1,420,387 1,505,657 85,270

 

Trade receivables from third parties may be broken down as follows:

 

 

(€'000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation
Third parties 965,003 662,856 (302,148)
Loss allowance (259,917) (275,083) (15,166)
Total 705,086 387,773 (317,314)

Trade receivables from third parties of €387.8 million, net of the loss allowance (€275.1 million), show a net
decrease of €317.3 million, almost entirely due to the reduction in amounts due from the Ethiopian customer
following collections received during the year. The balance includes amounts mainly due from Italian, Ethiopian,
Venezuelan and Slovakian customers for invoices issued and for work performed and approved by customers

but still to be invoiced.

The following notes and the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report provide more

information.
