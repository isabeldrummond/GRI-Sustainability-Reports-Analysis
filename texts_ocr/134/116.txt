The presence of female employees is higher at the central Milan and Rome offices, where they make up 37%
of the total workforce (+1% on 2018).

The average remuneration received by women compared to that received by men in 2018 was 69% for the
managers and 85% for the white collar employees. This percentage is affected by the fact that the male

employees have greater seniority than the female employees.

The diversity and inclusion initiatives will continue in 2020 with specific projects that are already being prepared.
They include training on intercultural dialogue, mentoring and reverse mentoring, specific training courses on
female leadership and projects to increase awareness about gender diversity at leadership level for both men

and women.

Health and safety in the workplace

Focus on health and safety in the workplace is one of Salini Impregilo’s fundamental values. It has an ISO 45001
certified occupational health and safety management system, which defines the main processes, roles and

specific responsibilities to achieve its objectives and implement its safety policies.
The new certifications have been updated as follows:

- scope: to include definitive and executive designs, works management and works performance to build
large infrastructures, complex civil and industrial works and related technological systems, and the
design and management of integrated operation and maintenance services for infrastructure, civil and
industrial buildings, related technological systems and electromedical devices.

- application: all the work sites where the Company operates and all types of company in which it is

involved.
The Corporate Safety, Environment and Systems Unit is organised to better meet management's objectives:

- ensuring coordination of the HSE management system activities to be of use to HSE teams at work
sites;

- encouraging a change in the HSE culture through a competence centre to develop policies;

- setting up a technical safety unit to further integrate health and safety aspects within engineering
processes;

- set up a corporate health unit to monitor contracts;

- ensuring continued health and safety operating support to the contract work sites.

The main risk the Group is exposed to in this respect is partial non-compliance with the relevant regulations with
the resulting potential impact on its workers, in terms of professional illnesses and injuries, and on itself in terms
of potential sanctions. Changes in regulations and external factors tied to the operating context (e.g., climate,

social, cultural factors) are the main sources of risk for the Company.
