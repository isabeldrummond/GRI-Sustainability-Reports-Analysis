On 29 July 2013, Salini Impregilo, as leader of an international consortium, won a portion of the maxi contract

Riyadh Metro Line 3

awarded by ArRiyadh Development Authority to design and construct the new Riyadh Metro line (Line 3, 41.2
km), the longest line of the challenging project for the metro system of Saudi Arabia’s capital. It will have a

transportation capacity of five thousand people per hour in each direction.

On 11 July 2018, the parties finalised a contract variation which increased the value of the works to be performed

by the consortium to design and construct the entire Line 3.

As a result of this variation, the contract's value increased from roughly USD6.0 billion to roughly USD6.4 billion,
including approximately USD5.3 billion for the civil works (previously approximately USD4.9 billion). Salini
Impregilo’s share is 66%.
