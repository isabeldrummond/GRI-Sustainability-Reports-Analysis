Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are recognised at cost net of impairment losses.

Goodwill acquired as part of a business combination is measured as the difference between the aggregate of
the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration considered, the amount of any NCI and the acquisition-date
fair value of the acquirer’s previously-held equity interest in the acquiree, and the net of the acquisition-date

amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

Goodwill deriving from acquisitions is not amortised. It is tested annually for impairment or whenever conditions

arise that presume impairment as per IAS 36 - Impairment of assets.

For impairment testing purposes, goodwill acquired as part of a business combination is allocated at the
acquisition date to each of the cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units - CGU) that will benefit
from the acquisition. The carrying amount of goodwill is monitored at cash-generating unit level for internal

management purposes.

Impairment is determined by defining the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) to
which the goodwill is allocated. When the recoverable amount of the CGU (or group of CGUs) is lower than
the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. When goodwill is allocated to a CGU (or group of
CGUs), the asset of which has been partly disposed of, the goodwill allocated to the disposed of asset is
considered to determine any gain or loss deriving from the transaction. In this case, the transferred goodwill is

measured using the amounts related to the disposed of asset compared to the asset still held by the unit.
Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets acquired or generated internally are recognised under assets in accordance with IAS
38 - Intangible assets when it is probable that the use of the asset will generate future economic benefits and
the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Those assets with finite useful lives are measured at acquisition
or development cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Recoverability of
their carrying amount is checked by using the criteria set out in the section on “Impairment of non-financial

assets”.
Other non-current assets (recognised in Other assets)

Other non-current assets mainly consist of loans and receivables and claims related to completed or nearly
completed contracts and companies in liquidation when their liquidation plan provides for the realisation of the

assets after twelve months from the reporting date.

These assets are measured at their estimated realisable value, by recognising allowances to adjust their
carrying amount accordingly. Claims are only recognised for the amounts matured and that part which is held
to be reasonably recoverable. The estimated realisable value is discounted if the time value of money is

material depending on when settlement is expected to take place.
