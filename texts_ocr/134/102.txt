timing and costs and a company’s social and environmental performance thanks to less work-related incidents,

a smaller impact on the environment and the communities affected by its operations.

The Company’s sector is known for the highly customised processing, techniques and technologies deployed
depending on the nature of the works to be performed. Each project is unique and requires the development of
bespoke solutions designed thanks to highly specialist know-how. The Group’s work sites are hives of innovation

and advanced research.

technologies.

At company level, the technical departments work unceasingly to develop state-of-the-art methods for projects
and support processes. The Company’s technicians work alongside the best experts and professionals in the
market, universities and research centres to develop tailored solutions able to meet clients’ requirements while

protecting the local environment and communities right from the initial tender stage.
