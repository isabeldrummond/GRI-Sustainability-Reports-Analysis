Counterparty risk

Management of counterparty risk requires identification of potential criticalities linked to relationships with the
Group’s clients, shareholders, subcontractors and suppliers, so as to create a comprehensive overview of the
features of the partners with which Salini Impregilo may start or continue to collaborate. For each of the above
counterparty types, risk factors linked to financial and operational reliability apply to a different extent, as does
the potential strategic role of a partnership for a specific business initiative, as well as all legal and compliance
aspects and those related to the applicable standards (ethics, quality, health and safety, environment, human
rights) that safeguard the lawfulness of the relationship. The Group performs a counterparty analysis for each
new project, involving all the competent departments and the Group Risk Officer, to obtain more precise
identification of the critical issues that could arise during the contract’s operational stages and more accurate

planning of the possible mitigation actions.
Contract risk

The contract dimension is key for an effective analysis of all risks linked to the Group’s core business, since it is
considered to define tools capable of identifying and monitoring so-called contract risks starting from the bidding
stage in a risk prevention perspective, as part of an in-depth analysis of the risks and opportunities linked to the
pursuit of a specific activity. Another fundamental aspect is the ongoing tracking of risks once they have been
consciously taken on by management, managing the resulting risk exposure in a proactive, dynamic way, as

well as its ongoing development over time.

The analysis of key risk dimensions and the related risk areas has the aim of providing management with a two-
sided overview: a detailed one (i.e. at individual country, counterparty and contract level) and a portfolio one (for
assessment of the overall exposure to such dimension), in order to assess the Group’s risk profile as well as its
compliance with the exposure limits imposed by its risk management capacity. Moreover, the portfolio overview
enables the performance of systematic assessments about the potential development of the risk profile upon
occurrence of certain events and/or specific choices that may result in any changes to it, through the use of

dedicated risk management tools.

The risk management framework, as outlined above and subject to further and future developments, has been
designed to support decision-making and operational processes at every stage of the management of projects,
in order to reduce the possibility that certain events may compromise the Group’s normal business operations
or attainment of its defined strategic objectives: to this end, it is integrated in strategic and business planning
processes, which, therefore, cannot be separated from the Group’s risk profile, as well as from its choices in

terms of risk appetite.
