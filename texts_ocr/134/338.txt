Risk management

The Group is exposed to financial risks which encompass all the risks related to capital availability, affected by

credit and liquidity management and/or the volatility of market factors such as interest and exchange rates.

Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of

changes in market prices. Market risk comprises currency risk and interest rate risk.

Currency risk

The Group’s international presence entails its exposure to currency risk arising from fluctuations in the value
of trade and financial transactions in currencies other than the individual group companies’ functional
currencies. The Group has adopted a currency risk management strategy to mitigate this risk based on the
guidelines described in the “Risk management system” section of the Directors’ report to which reference is

made.
Currency risk at 31 December 2019 mainly related to the following currencies:
e US dollar (USD)
e Ethiopian Birr (BIRR)
e Australian dollar (AUD)
e Colombian peso (COP)
e = Tajikistani somoni (TJS)
e South African rand (ZAR)

The Group considers each group company’s assets and liabilities in currencies other than its functional currency,
net of derivatives agreed to hedge the above trade and financial transactions, when assessing the potential

effects of fluctuations in the above currencies.

The following table shows the results of the sensitivity analysis, which considers a 5% increase or decrease in
the exchange rates compared to the actual exchange rates at 31 December 2019 and 2018 to reflect the

potential effects on profit (loss) and equity.
