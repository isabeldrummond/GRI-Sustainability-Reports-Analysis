Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements

Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of the Salini Impregilo Group
(the “group"), which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December
2019, the statements of profit or loss, other comprehensive income, cash flows and
changes in equity for the year then ended and notes thereto, which include a summary
of the significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
Shancial postion of fhe Sul bnproglo Group as at $1 December 2019 and of its
financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the
Intemational Financial Reporting Standards endorsed by the European Union and the
Italian regulations implementing article 9 of Legislative decree no. 38/05.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA
Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
“Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements” section
of our report. We are independent of Salini Impregilo S.p_A. (the “parent*) in
accordance with the ethics and independence rules and standards applicable in Italy
to audits of financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
