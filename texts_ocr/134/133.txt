- projects in the clean water area, such as desalination, drinking water and water treatment plants, water

storage for drinking and/or irrigation purposes (adaptation to resource scarcity), hydraulic projects in

urban areas to reduce flooding and water pollution (adaptation to extreme weather events);

- utilisation of eco-design and construction systems to improve infrastructures’ resilience to extreme

climate events in the short and medium to long term.

The ongoing clean water projects respond to the specific requirements of areas affected by increasing water

scarcity (such as the desalination plants built in the Middle East and irrigation water storage in Africa), the more

frequent extreme weather events (the hydraulic projects carried out in the main urban centres in the US) and

the pollution of rivers and water basins (the Riachuelo River in Argentina and the Caloosahatchee West Basin

Storage Reservoir in the US). The benefits to the populations affected by the Group’s projects are summarised

Investments in water business area infrastructure, as shown in the following graph?2 will by necessity continue

to be substantial in the next 20 years, driven by two main factors: the growing global population and climate

change.
