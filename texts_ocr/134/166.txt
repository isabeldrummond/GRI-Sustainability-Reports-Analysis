*The equal opportunities topic is material mostly for the corporate offices while it is of less significance at the work sites given

the characteristics of the construction sector, which is a predominantly male domain.

A new material topic was identified during the procedure to update the materiality analysis, which was not

present in the previous Statement: Innovation. It is not included in the previous table as this is not required by

Legislative decree no. 254/2016 or the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards. However, this Statement

includes the topic as required by the latter Standards.
