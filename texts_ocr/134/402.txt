b) the lease term was estimated based on the contract clauses to identify the non-cancellable period of the
lease; the company considered the contracts in which the leased assets are used for the termination

and renewal options;

The captions “Right-of-use assets” and “Lease liabilities” include the effect of applying IFRS 16. The leased
assets and the related financial liabilities that, under the previous standard applicable at 31 December 2018,
were recognised in the captions “Property, plant and equipment” and “Finance lease liabilities”, respectively,

have been reclassified as set out below.
The company is a lessor of right-of-use assets which it accounts for as operating leases.

It is not required to reclassify those leases in which it is the lessor under IFRS 16, except for subleases. The
company has assessed its classification of subleases considering the right-of-use asset rather than the

underlying asset and has found that they comply with the definition of operating leases as per IFRS 16.

The following table shows the effect of application of the new standard on opening equity at 1 January 2019:

Lease liabilities presented in the above statement of financial position at the date of initial application amount to
€41.1 million. Commitments arising from operating leases presented under IAS 17 at 31 December 2018,
discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application, amounted to €51.2 million. The
decrease is mostly due to the better estimate made of the lease term and the application of the practical
expedients for short-term leases (less than 12 months) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.
IFRIC 23 provides guidance on the determination of taxable profit where there is uncertainty over income tax
treatments. The interpretation establishes that if it is not probable that a particular tax treatment will be accepted
by the tax authority, the entity shall reflect this uncertainty in its financial statements. Accordingly, based on past
experience of tax assessments performed by the Ethiopian tax authorities, the company recognised a higher
tax liability of €8 million compared to 2017 and 2018 as these years are still open to assessment. The
interpretation’s transition provisions allow this effect to be recognised under retained earnings at 1 January 2019

and the comparative figures do not have to be restated.
