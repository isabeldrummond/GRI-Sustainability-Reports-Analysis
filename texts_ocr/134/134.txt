It has been estimated that, in the Middle East alone, the production of desalinated water will increase by 14
times before 204023 and new demand will mostly be met through plants that use the reverse osmosis technology,
extensively used by Fisia italimpianti in its ongoing projects. It allows a reduction in GHG emissions of around

six times that of thermal desalination plants.

A common thread linking all the Group’s business areas is the growing focus on new infrastructure’s resilience
to climate change. Alongside the usual studies of the durability and safety of infrastructure, specific studies are
increasingly commissioned on the expected climatic situation in the areas where the projects are taking place.
They are designed to understand the potential future effects of these climatic factors on the works (e.g., the

volume of rainfalls, wind strengths and temperatures) to improve their resilience.

This issue is of great importance for works that are heavily exposed to the effects of atmospheric agents, such
as roads, bridges and viaducts, as their resilience over time is essential to their users’ safety. The Company has
accumulated significant experience in the use of design techniques and studies of materials that reflect future
climate projections. Example of this are the award-winning Skytrain Bridge, built as part of the Sydney Metro
Northwest project and designed to stand up to rain, flooding and winds forecast after 2100 or the New Genoa

Bridge, designed to deal with the expected increase in rainfall over the next 80 years.

The Group’s carbon footprint

The direct risk to the climate generated by the Group’s activities mostly relates to the use of fossil fuels in

operations and materials which involve carbon intensive processes (e.g., cement and steel).

Considering the entire life cycle of the Group’s projects, these effects are temporary, as they only take place
during the construction period, and should be considered in light of the benefits of using the infrastructure, which
has a much longer useful life, usually at least a couple of decades. In fact, many works are designed to be

operated over 80 to 100 years if not longer.

While the Group’s business is characterised by highly customised processing, techniques and technologies
depending on the specific requirements of the works to be built and the characteristics of the areas where they
will be located, Salini Impregilo has actively pursued improvement in energy efficiency for some years to

decrease its carbon footprint. The following tables show its energy consumption and the related GHG emissions:
