In 2018 and 2019, Condotte faced a serious financial crisis and applied for extraordinary administration pursuant
to Decree law no. 347/2003, converted with amendments by Law no. 39/2004. The application was allowed by
the Ministerial decree of 6 August 2018 and the Rome Court resolution of 14 August 2018 declaring Condotte

insolvent. Accordingly, Condotte is now operating under the extraordinary administration procedure.

During the validity of the extraordinary administration, Condotte failed to fulfil its consortium obligations provided
for by COCIV’s by-laws (the “by-laws”), as well as the consortium members’ agreements supplementing the

provisions of the by-laws (the “consortium members’ agreements’).

Specifically, Condotte failed to provide COCIV with the counter-guarantees necessary to allow COCIV to obtain
the guarantees to be provided to RFI when the contracts for the construction lots into which the work was divided
by RFI (and before that by the CIPE) were signed due to the need to have the financial resources necessary for

the project’s construction.

The breach occurred in connection with the fifth and sixth construction lots’ contract execution, following RFI’s

notifications of 17 December 2018 and 27 June 2019, respectively.

In both cases, the consortium was only able to remedy Condotte’s breaches thanks to the other two members
(Salini Impregilo and CIV), which provided the necessary counter-guarantees that Condotte had not given,

thereby enabling COCIV to obtain the guarantees from the banks to be provided to RFI.

After having formally challenged Condotte’s failure to comply with its counter-guarantee obligations for the fifth
construction lot, in accordance with the by-laws and consortium members’ agreements, on 18 April 2019, COCIV
passed a resolution of the board of representatives - the competent body under the by-laws - (the “first

resolution”), whereby:

(i) it ordered the reduction in Condotte’s interest to the minimum interest allowed (0.001%);

(ii

it allocated the portion so decreased to the other consortium members (specifically to Salini Impregilo,
as CIV refused);

(iii) it adopted the necessary amendments to the by-laws following the changes in the consortium’s

membership structure;
(iv) it adopted other necessary measures for the ordered reduction in Condotte’s interest.

In order to enforce the reallocation among the other consortium members of the defaulting member’s decreased
interest and the consequent amendment to its by-laws vis-a-vis RFI, the by-laws required the latter’s consent.
Therefore, anticipating that the customer would have given its consent in a timely manner, in connection with
the first resolution, COCIV passed a single resolution to reduce and increase interests and amend its by-laws
(unifying the internal and external effects of its resolution into a single act). Taking into account RFI’s position in

relation to the first resolution during the interlocutory stage, when Condotte’s second, serious and repeated
