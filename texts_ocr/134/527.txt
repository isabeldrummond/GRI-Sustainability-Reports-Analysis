The directors and management informed us periodically about the operations and key transactions
undertaken by the company and its subsidiaries. They also described such operations and transactions in
their report, to which reference is made, with details of their characteristics and effects.

We obtained adequate information about them in order to be in a position to reasonably believe that they
comply with the law, the by-laws and principles of correct administration and that they are not imprudent,
risky or contrary to the resolutions taken by the shareholders or such that would compromise the
company’s assets.

Transactions in which the directors or other related parties have an interest are subjected to the
transparency procedures required by the ruling legislation.

2. Atypical and/or unusual transactions carried out with third parties, intragroup
transactions or related party transactions

We did not identify nor were we informed by the directors, independent auditors or internal audit
supervisor about any atypical and/or unusual transactions (as per the definition in Consob communication
no. DEM/6064293 of 28 July 2006) carried out with third parties, related parties or other group companies.

The directors described the day-to-day transactions carried out during the year with group companies and
related parties in the notes to the separate financial statements to which reference should be made, also
for details about their characteristics and financial effects.

They did not identify any critical issues with respect to their suitability and compliance with the company’s
interests.

We checked that the procedure for related party transactions adopted by the company is applied,
including the regular reporting by the board of directors on any such transactions.

3. Comments on and proposals about the findings and disclosures in the independent
auditors’ report

On 10 April 2019, the independent auditors, KPMG S.p.A., issued its report pursuant to article 14 of
Legislative decree no. 39 of 27 January 2010 and article 10 of Regulation (EU) no. 537 of 16 April 2014.
KPMG S.p.A. states that, in its opinion:

- the separate and consolidated financial statements of Salini Impregilo S.p.A. give a true and fair view of
the financial position of the company and the Group as at 31 December 2019 and of their financial
performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards endorsed by the European Union and the Italian regulations implementing article 9 of
Legislative decree no. 38/05;

- the directors’ report and specific information presented in the report on corporate governance and the
ownership structure are consistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements of the
company and the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019 and have been prepared in
compliance with the law;

- there is nothing to report with reference to the statement required by article 14.2.e) of Legislative decree
no. 39/10 based on KPMG S.p.A.’s knowledge and understanding of the entity and its environment obtained
through its audit. On 10 April 2020, KPMG S.p.A. also issued its additional report pursuant to article 11 of
Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 confirming, inter alia, that based on the procedures performed, no significant
deficiencies in internal control were identified.

KPMG S.p.A.’s reports detail the key audit matters with respect to which reference should be made
thereto.
