The international community has undertaken important initiatives to manage the changes underway, like the

United Nations' 2030 Agenda (which includes the SDGs) for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate

Agreement.

Infrastructure directly and indirectly contributes to achievement of 92% of all the targets linked to the SGDs’. It

is a fundamental part of the fight against climate change as it contributes more than 60% of the global GHG

emissions?.

Meeting the growing global demand for infrastructure and achievement of the SDGs require investments that

can only increase over the next decades as shown in the next graph based on the Global Infrastructure Hub5

estimates.
