Estimate of the recoverable amount of assets relating to projects carried out in

Venezuela

Notes to the separate financial statements: notes 3 “Basis of presentation’, 8 “Non-
current

The separate financial statements at 31

assets of €204.5 million, €318.7 million and
€120.2 million, respectively, relating to

projects carried out in Venezuela. They also

include total impairment losses of €514.7

million relating to those assets, €35.7 million
of which recognised in profit or loss in 2019.
Estimating the recoverable amount of assets

relating to projects carried out in Venezuela
required a significant level of judgement by
the directors and entails a high uncertainty
level due to Venezuela's complex situation,

@s described in the “Main risk factors and

uncertainties” section of the directors’ report,

to which the notes to the separate financial
statements make reference.

For the above reasons, we believe that the
estimate of the recoverable amount of
contract assets, trade receivables and non-
current financial assets relating to projects
carried out in Venezuela is a key audit
matter.
