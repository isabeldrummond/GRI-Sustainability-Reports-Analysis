The main contributor to this item is SA.BRO.M. for design costs for the new Broni - Mortara regional motorway,
including the borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with IAS 23, which the Group expects to recover based
on the outcome of the contract. The item is not amortised as the concession is currently inoperative. More

information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report.

On 3 December 2018, the Terni Court ruled that the subconcession for the car park in Terni held by Corso del
Popolo S.p.A. was terminated. The operator appealed against this ruling and concurrently formally invited the
Terni municipal authorities to rebalance the economic and financial plan commencing arbitration procedures on
15 March 2019. The Terni municipal authorities notified its intention of analysing the identified issues through
an expert panel, which should complete its work in the first half of 2020. Should the Terni municipal authorities
not agree with the rebalancing proposals made by the expert panel, the group company will take the appropriate

legal action to recover its assets. Its legal advisors are confident that the outcome should be in its favour.
