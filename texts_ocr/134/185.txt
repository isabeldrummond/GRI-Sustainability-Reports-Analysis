Specifically, the Group has introduced all the necessary procedures to safeguard the health and safety of
workers with the distribution of appropriate personal protective equipment, intensification of sanitisation activities
of the work environments at work sites and the adoption of suitable measures to ensure correct social distancing
in the workplace. It has introduced remote work for nearly all its office staff in Italy. All business trips and travel
have been cancelled and are only to be undertaken in exceptional circumstances to guarantee operating
requirements when this cannot be postponed, in full compliance however with the limitations imposed by the

competent authorities.

Salini Impregilo has also agreed an insurance policy that includes a daily allowance and professional post-
hospital care services for all its employees who require hospitalisation as a result of being diagnosed with the

Coronavirus.

With respect to financial stress scenarios, the parent regularly monitors the Group’s current and expected
liquidity. The Group has cash and cash equivalents of over €1,000,000,000 as shown in its consolidated financial

statements at 31 December 2019 as well as revolving credit facilities of €550,000,000.

The parent does not have to make large debt repayments in 2020 or the first half of 2021 as it recently
renegotiated the contract terms of its borrowings with major banks as part of Progetto Italia. Its new repayment
plans provide for the final instalments to be repaid in 2025. In addition, in January 2020, the parent placed new
notes worth €250,000,000 on the market, part of which were exchanged with the outstanding “€600,000,000
3.75 per cent. Notes due 24 June 2021” issue (the “2021 notes”) for €120,970,000, and part of which were
subscribed by new investors (“additional new notes”) for €123,341,000. The new notes’ maturity date is 28
January 2027 and the coupon is 3.625%.

The next repayment dates of the parent’s corporate debt for the three note issues outstanding at the date of

preparation of the consolidated financial statements are in June 2021, October 2024 and January 2027.

Due to the rapid and continuous changes in the reference context, it is difficult to quantify the duration or impact
that the virus’ outbreak may have on the Group’s future commercial and operating activities and, therefore, on
its financial position, financial performance and cash flows in 2020. As a result, Salini Impregilo will update its

outlook for 2020 when it has more information to hand.

As a global provider of engineering solutions and contractor for infrastructure works, Salini Impregilo is affected
by the future investment decisions of its clients in its various business areas (Sustainable Mobility, Clean Hydro
Energy, Clean Water and Green Buildings): strategic sectors and potential drivers of the economic recovery of

many countries.
