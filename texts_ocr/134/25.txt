Salini Impregilo has drawn up a detailed financial plan for Progetto Italia, designed not only to achieve the
Project's objectives but also to improve the new construction hub's flexibility. The financial plan includes, inter
alia, the placing of new ordinary shares for €600 million, the commitment to subscribe Astaldi’s capital increase

for €225 million and the incorporation of Beyond S.r.l. to acquire the bonds issued by Astaldi.

subscription price, demonstrating the confidence in Salini Impregilo and Progetto Italia of European and US

investors and investors of other countries. It has expanded and further diversified the parent's investor base.

Costruttori S.p.A., CDP Equity S.p.A., Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., UniCredit S.p.A. and Banco BPM S.p.A.1". It also
led to a new corporate governance structure with the creation of a strategic committee to advise the board of

directors on Progetto Italia and its implementation.

Rebuilding the fragmented Italian construction sector, strengthening its financial structure and profit-making
capacity, enhancing its know-how and management skills, vertical geographical and specialisation integration:
these are the objectives set by Progetto Italia as a solid industrial operation that will create an increasingly global
and flexible player able to respond to the specific requirements of any individual context thanks to a network of

suppliers and partners in more than 50 countries and an unique blend of expertise and innovative capacity.

vision, accompanied by a strong and direct verb, "Build", that represents the DNA of a construction company
that builds large complex infrastructure, in addition to the values of solidity, quality and partnership, while the

word “We" expresses the fundamental role played by people and teams.
