personnel of private companies are used, the related contract includes service clauses for specific training about
respect for human rights and the Code of Ethics. They are provided with appropriate training about their tasks.
The training of personnel supplied by public safety forces complies with local regulations and standards and is

mainly provided by the relevant bodies.

Depending on the nature of the project, the security unit and local management define the best way of involving
the local stakeholders, mostly through formal meetings, informal meetings and discussions, training and official

events.

The Corporate Security Department performs specific assessments of security risks, coordinates the local
security units, defines internal standards and guidelines, prepares reports on significant events and carries out

regular audits of the operating units.

The main risks to which the Company is exposed arise from the potential violation of the above-mentioned

human rights by subcontractors and suppliers.

The Company has issued internal guidelines for its operating units for the correct management of the activities
at risk. These guidelines provide for management and monitoring of human rights and specific reports to be sent

to Corporate.

During 2019, the Company commenced a training programme on human rights to be provided in the first half of

2020 alongside other courses to raise employee awareness about the issue.

In 2019, Salini Impregilo measured the human rights risks of its supply chain by evaluating the contracts agreed
since 201815, to check the existence of suppliers based in countries and/or that supply goods considered at risk

(based on the source country).16

The evaluation showed that no supplier of goods and materials is based in the countries classified as high risk,
while 64% of the suppliers are based in countries with risks ranging from “very low” to “medium to low”. No
goods at risk were purchased from a significant supplier during the year'’. In addition to requesting its suppliers
accept the Code of Ethics and the Suppliers Code of Conduct, Salini Impregilo recently revised its screening
system, tightening up the vetting process for potential suppliers with respect to human rights. It also asks its
suppliers to collaborate in a loyal and transparent manner with the Group for the purposes of the checks and

audits of the correct compliance of its standards when they sign the related contracts.

15 Subcontracts were excluded from the evaluation as the related risks had been measured with the direct activities, as described earlier.

16 Once again, the Company referred to the Global Slavery Index to assess country risk and the lists of the U.S. Department of Labor’s

Bureau of International Labor Affairs to assess the risk that goods have been produced by chlld or forced labour.

‘7 A significant supplier is a supplier with contracts over €250 thousand. Below this threshold, the only purchases of commodities that could
be considered risky, albeit not characteristic of the construction sector, were the purchases of work clothes, electronic products and

foodstuffs, equal to 0.06% of total purchases.
