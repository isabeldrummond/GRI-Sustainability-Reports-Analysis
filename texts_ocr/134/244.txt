When the contract penalties are “reasonably expected”, the transaction price is reduced accordingly. The
company analyses all the indicators available at the reporting date to assess the probability of a contract default

that would lead to the application of penalties.

4.c Significant financing component

It is normal practice in the construction and large-scale infrastructure sector that the transaction price for the
project (which is usually completed over more than one year) is paid in the form of an advance and subsequent

progress billing (based on progress reports).

This method of allocating cash flows is often defined in the calls for tenders. The customer’s payment flows
(advances and subsequent progress billing) are usually organised to make construction of the project by the
contractor feasible, limiting its financial exposure. Constructors in the large-scale infrastructure sector build

projects for large amounts of money and the initial outlay is usually high.

The contract advance is used for the following reasons:

° to finance the initial contract investments and pay the related advances to subcontractors;
° as a form of guarantee to cover any risks of contractual breach by the customer.

The advance is reabsorbed by the subsequent progress billing in line with the stage of completion of the

contract.

Furthermore, the Group's operating cycle is generally several years. Therefore, it considers the correct time-

scale of its works to determine whether its contracts include a significant financing component.

Based on the above, it has not identified significant financing components in the transaction price for the
contracts that include changes in the advances or progress billings in line with sector practices and/or of
amounts that are suitable as guarantees and have a timeframe in line with the cash flows required to complete
the contract.

5. Losses to complete

The new standard does not specifically cover the accounting treatment of loss-making contracts but refers to
IAS 15, which regulates the measurement and classification (previously covered by IAS 11) of onerous
contracts. IAS 37 provides that an onerous contract is one in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the
obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The present
obligation under the contract shall be recognised and measured as a provision when the loss is probable based

on the most recent forecasts prepared by management.

The unavoidable costs are all those costs that:

° are directly proportionate to the contract and increase the performance obligation transferred to the
customer;

° do not include those costs that will be incurred regardless of satisfaction of the performance obligation;

° cannot be avoided by the company through future actions.
