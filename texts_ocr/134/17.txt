The environmental advantages of using Eco-design & Construction systems are measured by comparing them
to environmental performances obtained using standard design and construction methods. The Group has found
that green buildings generate lower environmental impacts of more than 30% and this is one of the reasons why
the Group's projects have garnered important accolades at international level for their innovative and

environmental sustainability characteristics.

Strategic pillars
Given the complexity of global challenges and the competitive playing field, the Group has to be agile and
dynamic, ready to pre-empt the market's needs before it is even aware of them and the related business

opportunities.

Accordingly, the Group has refreshed its organisational model significantly in recent years to ensure continuous

improvement and a sharper focus on efficiency, innovation and responsible conduct.
Efficiency

This organisational overview has affected the entire Group, has had a profound impact on its internal culture
and has required the active involvement of all levels of decision makers and operational resources. The objective
was to ensure optimal management of all core processes, from commercial planning to the bidding and

execution processes.

The corporate competence centres ensure the application of best practices and the Group's guidelines by all

subsidiaries as well as optimisation of operating competencies and synergies along the entire value chain.
