can also be used by third parties (e.g., local communities). Typical communications received locally relate to
inconveniences caused by the work site equipment (traffic, dust) and construction activities (noise, vibrations)

or damage to private property.

Reference should be made to the section on “Main risk factors and uncertainties” (“Criminal litigation” paragraph)

of the Directors’ report for ongoing environment-related disputes.

The methods to manage the main environmental issues are described below. The environmental data are
heavily affected by the number and type of works under construction, the client’s design decisions and the stage
of completion of the individual projects. Accordingly, a comparison with previous periods may not always be

significant, especially in terms of the absolute values.

The local area and the circular economy

At the end of 2019, the Group’s work sites included in the scope of this Statement included 396 operational
sites, of which 60 underground, for a total surface area of 208,194,021 m2. The following table shows the main

data by geographical area

The American continent is the geographical area where the Group has the largest surface areas inside protected
areas. This is due to the acquisition of the Caloosahatchee (C43) West Basin Storage Reservoir contract in
Florida, USA in June 2019. The project is part of a larger plan, The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration
Plan, a long-term plan approved by the US Congress to restore, protect and preserve the environment of a
protected area of great importance to the community, the economy and ecosystem of Florida. The Everglades
provide drinking water to more than eight million people, supports the flourishing agricultural and tourist sectors
of Florida, has unique natural habitats and is home to two native American tribes. The Group’s share of the
project is to build a reservoir as part of the plan to contain wastewater discharges, improve water quality, restore

natural habitats and preserve the protected species.

The interaction between the Group’s activities and protected areas in other areas around the world is extremely
limited. More information is available in the “Biodiversity, cultural heritage and environmental restorations”

section.
