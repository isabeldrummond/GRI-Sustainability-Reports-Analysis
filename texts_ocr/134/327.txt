The provision for risks on equity investments relates to expected impairment losses on the carrying amount of

the Group’s investments in associates for the part that exceeds their carrying amounts.

The losses of the equity-accounted investees are mostly due to the Lane Group joint ventures and, in particular,
the joint venture working on the I-4 Ultimate project. It made a loss in 2019 due to the higher costs incurred for

the project.
