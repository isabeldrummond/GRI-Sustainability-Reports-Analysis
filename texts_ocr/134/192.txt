In January 2016, with works completion at 99.9%, following a number of disputes between the parties, the
customer terminated the contract and enforced the contractual guarantees of approximately €13 million on 20
April 2016, motivating such unilateral decision as being due to the alleged non-resolution of non-compliances

notified by works management. The parent promptly formally contested the contract termination.

With respect to the arbitration proceeding before the Paris International Chamber of Commerce for the delays
and additional costs of €57 million, on 17 October 2019, the award was handed down rejecting the Group’s
requests and awarding damages to the customer for delays of approximately €19 million. The parent has

presented an application for the cancellation of the award to the Romanian courts.

The directors are confident that its arguments will be accepted at the end of the dispute supported by the opinion

of their legal advisors.

Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the Group has accordingly presented its request for additional
consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of the contract assets and liabilities for the part

deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors.

Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable

events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date.
Contorno Rodoviario Florianopolis (Brazil)

On 21 September 2016, the Salini Impregilo S.p.A. and Cigla Constructora Impregilo e Associados S.A. (“CCIA”)
joint venture signed a contract with Autopista Litoral Sul S.A. worth approximately €75 million for the construction

of a new dual carriageway to reduce the large volume of traffic in the Floriandpolis metropolitan region.

The project immediately ran into critical engineering problems due to the damp soil and the area’s weather
conditions, which CCIA attempted to resolve by proposing new solutions to the customer (although it was not

contractually obliged to do so).

In early 2018, CCIA presented claims to the customer for higher costs and extension of the contract term.
Despite the fact that the negotiations were still ongoing and the related memorandum of understanding was
supposed to be signed in the near future, in January 2019, the customer informed CCIA of its intention to
terminate the contract. CCIA deems that this termination is illegal and contrary to the principle of good faith.
Therefore, in 2019, it filed an appeal with the competent local judicial authorities and the proceeding is in its

initial stage.
On 4 October 2019, CCIA commenced an arbitration proceeding with the Sao Paolo International Chamber of
Commerce for claims of approximately €20 million notified before the contract had been terminated.

The consortium is confident that its arguments will be accepted supported by the opinion of its legal advisors.

Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the consortium has accordingly presented its request for additional
consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed

highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors.

Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that events may take place

in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change its valuations.
