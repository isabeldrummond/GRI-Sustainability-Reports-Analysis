4. Complaints as per article 2408 of the Italian Civil Code, actions taken by the board of
statutory auditors and related outcome

We did not receive any complaints as per article 2408 or other complaints from third parties during the
year.

The company has a whistleblowing procedure and information channels suitable to ensure the receipt,
analysis and processing of reports about internal control, corporate information, the company’s
administrative liability, fraud or other issues by employees, members of the company bodies or third
parties, which can also be made confidentially or anonymously.

5. Engagement of independent auditors and related fees

We confirm that the fees received by KPMG S.p.A. for its attestation services amount to €1,101,500. This
amount consists of €1,035,000 for engagements approved by us in advance and €66,500 for engagements
not approved in advance as they were either for amounts below the threshold established in the Procedure
for the conferral of engagements to audit companies or related to long-term services approved in previous
years.

Reference should be made to the table presenting the fees paid to KPMG S.p.A. and its network entities in
2019 provided in the notes to the separate financial statements.

Pursuant to article 6.2.a) of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014, KPMG S.p.A. provided us with the statement
that, considering the services it provided, it remained independent vis-a-vis the company and the Group
throughout the year and that it communicated to us any non-statutory audit services provided by it and
the KPMG network entities to the company on a timely basis.
