This analysis excludes the effects of the translation of the equity of companies or joint operations with a currency

other than the Euro.
Interest rate risk

The company has revised its debt structure significantly, increasing its fixed rate exposure. For this reason, had
interest rates increased or decreased by an average 75 basis points in 2019, the profit before tax for the year
would have been respectively smaller or greater by €4.9 million (€4.8 million for 2018), assuming that all other

variables remained constant.
Credit risk

Credit risk is that deriving from the company’s exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ (which

are mostly governments or state bodies) non-compliance with their obligations.

Management of this risk is complex, starting as early as the assessment of offers, through a careful analysis of
the characteristics of the countries in which the company’s activities should be carried out and the customers,

which are usually state or similar bodies, requesting an offer.

Therefore, this risk can be essentially assimilated to the country risk. An analysis of this risk based on the age
of the outstanding amounts is not very meaningful, since the receivables (mostly due from state bodies) should
be assessed together with the related working capital items, especially those reflecting the net exposure to

customers (contract assets and liabilities) in relation to contract work in progress as a whole.
