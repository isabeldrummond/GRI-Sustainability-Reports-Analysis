Ethiopia is ranked 135th in the SDG Global Rank. With respect to the goals that are most pertinent to the Group’s
business areas in the country, it shows significant progress with respect to the fight against climate change,

respect to water and mobility.

Ethiopia continues to be one of the fastest growing economies in Africa with GDP growth of nearly 8%.

Thanks to the growing prestige of the leader Abiy Ahmed, the country’s cooperation with Europe, the United

States and the East has intensified.

The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are among the supranational bodies that provide support
and ongoing guidance to the country while the European Union has recently lent Ethiopia €170 million to assist

the local government with its ongoing political and economic reforms.

The African country’s commercial and strategic importance will encourage the inflow of hard currencies to the
central bank in Addis Abeba.

This is key to providing the financial resources necessary to, inter alia, make foreign payments for infrastructure

projects.

Outlook for 2020

The local government intends to make the most of the country’s natural resources, and especially its water

resources, to encourage investments in renewable energy and the installation of additional production capacity.

The generation of electricity and its subsequent export to the surrounding countries will assist the continent's

integration and encourage flows of hard currency.
