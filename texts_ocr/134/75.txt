Income taxes

The increase in income taxes is due to the significant rise in the profit before tax, the payment to settle the tax
assessment in Ethiopia and the results of the group companies.

Loss from discontinued operations

The loss from discontinued operations of €0.9 million (profit of €114.8 million) entirely reflects the costs of the
USW Campania business unit for the year. The profit for 2018 also included the loss of €115.2 million made by

Lane’s Plants & Paving Division, which was sold in December 2018.

Non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests amount to a profit of €8.0 million. They mainly relate to the group companies working
in Saudi Arabia on the construction of Line 3 of the Riyadh metro. The loss for 2018 was due to the allocation

of the loss for that year to non-controlling interests.
