The investigations focused on assumed collusive bidding and most of the challenged events took place quite
some time ago (2013 to 2016).The charges refer to alleged conduct that could only be carried out by the
individuals in charge of managing the related procedures. This implies that the alleged involvement of key
management personnel (the then chairman of the consortium) and the parent’s chief executive officer, would

not lead to the identification of any real activities and/or conduct that these persons actually undertook.

With respect to the criminal proceedings commenced by the Rome public for the alleged crime of association
for criminal purposes, the dismissal of the related criminal proceedings has been applied for and obtained as

the related charge cannot be sustained.

With respect to all the alleged corruption practices, involving the alleged administrative liability of COCIV and
Reggio Calabria - Scilla S.C.p.A. for the administrative offence as per articles 5 and 25 of Legislative decree no.
231/2001, the Rome Court declared its lack of jurisdiction and referred all the cases to the Bolzano public
prosecutor which joined them in a single case and requested that it be heard. During the preliminary hearing of
26 June 2019, the judge declared its lack of jurisdiction and ordered the case be referred to the Alessandria

Court, where it has been again included in the investigation phase.
The Alessandra Court has yet to set the date for the preliminary hearing before the Preliminary Hearing Judge.

With respect to the alleged bribery, COCIV deems that, as already found by the Genoa public procecutor, the
crimes allegedly committed by its personnel (should they be found guilty by the court) were to its detriment and
were essentially committed in their own interests by fraudulently circumventing the rules in place to control its
activities. Moreover, these alleged offences would not have required RFI to pay a larger or undue amount or
create economic benefits for COCIV but rather would have required it to pay higher costs. The consortium’s new
structure (senior management and operating personnel) is committed to ensuring that the works can continue
while concurrently dealing with the social and employment issues arising from the discontinuity measures that
the consortium has had to put in place vis-a-vis the third party companies involved in the legal proceedings. The
consortium has carefully checked the quality of the materials used in the works previously carried out although
this is not an issue raised by the public prosecutors. Its results are wholly in line with the findings of the expert
appointed by the Genoa court, which both found the full compliance of the materials used by COCIV with the

quality levels specified in the contracts and relevant legislation.
Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A.

Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. was notified of the commencement of proceedings before the Rimini Court for an
alleged administrative offence as per article 25-septies.3 of Legislative decree no. 231/2001. The preliminary

investigation is still ongoing.

Ministry of the Environment / Autostrade per I'Italia S.p.A. - Todini Construction Generali (now HCE Construction
+ others)

In June 2011, upon conclusion of the investigations commenced in 2005, the Florence public prosecutor charged
the CEOs and former employees of Todini with environmental crimes with respect to the management of

excavated soil and rocks, water regulation, waste management and damage to environment assets as part of
