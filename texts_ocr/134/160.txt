° €3.0 of work income distributed for each Euro paid by the Group;
° €2.6 of GDP for each Euro of added value generated by Salini Impregilo;

° €4.1 of tax revenues for each Euro paid by the Group to the public administration.

These figures confirm that the Group’s local investment policies have a significant knock-on effect on the

economies of the countries where it operates.

In addition to the economic benefits to the countries, each person involved in a group project benefits in terms

of the work income received and the opportunity to advance professionally thanks to the training received.

Many studies?” have shown that professional training courses provided by companies generate significant
benefits for the participating employees who thus potentially have better employment and career prospects,
higher salaries, greater professional satisfaction, more flexibility and interest in receiving additional training. This
can also have a positive effect on the employee’s health, social inclusion and their willingness to invest in further

education for themselves and their children, triggering intergenerational social mobility mechanisms.

In this respect, the Group provided 482,358 hours of training to its direct employees and those of its

subcontractors in 2019.

Initiatives to assist local areas

The Group contributes to developing the areas in which it works through initiatives to assist the local
communities, which may include sponsorships, social and philanthropic initiatives. Sponsorships and donations
are managed in line with the specific guidelines and internal procedures that are part of the Anti-corruption
System, which is ISO 37001 certified. This ensures that any assistance is in line with the approved budgets and

is only given after the positive outcome of checks of the potential recipients.

The Group Guidelines require that assistance is given locally in five strategic macro-sectors: social, art and

culture, education and research, environment, sport and entertainment.
The main initiatives carried out can be classified as follows:

e direct assistance to design and build infrastructure benefitting the local community such as, for example,
schools, healthcare facilities, roads, etc.;

e assistance with social programmes, carried out directly or through other organisations in the above
macro-sectors;

e free access to certain work site facilities such as clinics, water and electricity supply networks for local

communities living in rural areas not connected to basic services.

The Group carried out 42 initiatives in 2019 for €0.8 million (2018: roughly €4.4 million). The reduction in
investments is mainly due to the sale of Lane’s Plants & Paving Division in the US. As it works in a continuous

business, it promotes ongoing initiatives to the benefit of its local communities.
