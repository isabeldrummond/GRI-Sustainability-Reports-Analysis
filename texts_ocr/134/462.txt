company has guarantees given by its subcontractors;

sureties for bank loans: they amount to €693.2 million and relate to subsidiaries (€458.4 million),
associates (€140.4 million) and other group companies (€21.5 million). The residual amount of €72.9

million relates to the company;

other personal guarantees of €59.0 million consisting of guarantees related to customs and tax

obligations and other commitments (€5,752.5 million);

collateral related to a lien on the remaining shares of the SPE M4 (€5.7 million).

Litigation and contingent liabilities

The company is involved in civil and administrative proceedings that are not expected to have a significant

negative effect on its separate financial statements, based on the information currently available and the

existing provisions for risks. The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report provides

information about the main disputes.

the dispute about the assessment notice challenging the tax treatment of impairment losses and losses
on the sale of assets recognised by the company in 2003 has been settled. The main issue related to the
sale by Impregilo S.p.A. (now Salini Impregilo S.p.A.) of its investment in the Chilean operator Costanera
Norte SA to Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. had been cancelled by the Milan Regional Tax
Commission on 11 September 2009 (higher assessed tax base of €70 million). After the hearing held on
24 April 2018 and the filing of a motion for the suspension of the trial on 14 November 2018, the Supreme
Court ordered the case be placed on the court calendar again. The company applied the procedure for
the out-of-court settlement of tax disputes introduced by article 6 of Decree law no. 119 of 23 October
2018, converted into Law no. 136 of 17 December 2018. On 28 May 2019, it presented its application for

payment by instalment;
