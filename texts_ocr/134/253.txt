A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or classified as held for
sale and that meets any of the following criteria: i) it represents a separate major line of business or
geographical area of operations; ii) it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of

business or geographical area of operations; or iii) it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a plan to resell.

The profit or loss from discontinued operations is disclosed separately in the statement of profit or loss. As
required by paragraph 34 of IFRS 5 - Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the

corresponding prior year figures are reclassified accordingly.
Revenue from contracts with customers

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised using the five-step model: (i) identify the contract with a
customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv)
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) recognise revenue when (or

as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
More information is available in the “Contract assets and liabilities” paragraph of these notes.
Interest income

Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis, considering the principal and applicable effective interest
rate, ie., the rate that discounts the estimated future inflows over the expected life of the financial asset to

return it to its carrying amount.

Dividends

Dividends are recognised when the investors’ right to receive payment arises in line with local ruling legislation.
Earnings (loss) per share

Basic earnings per share are calculated as the ratio of the profit or loss for the year attributable to the holders
of the ordinary shares of the parent to the weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated considering the potential diluting effect of exercise of their rights by
the holders of rights that potentially have a diluting effect on shares when calculating the number of outstanding
shares.

Operating segments

The operating segments comply with the reporting system provided to group management which is in charge of
allocating the resources and assessing the results obtained by the segments. The Group’s management and
organisational structure presents the segments according to a geographical breakdown in macro-areas, on the

basis of the Italy, Abroad and Lane Group segments.

The intrasegment transfer prices related to the exchange of goods and services are agreed at normal market

conditions.
