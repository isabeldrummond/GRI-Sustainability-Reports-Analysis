Specifically, workers are exposed to various types of risks that could affect their health and safety based on the
geographical location of each operating unit and their specific activities. Each office and work site that applies

the Group’s health and safety management system has the following measures to manage these risks:

- identification and assessment of the exposure to the risk;

- identification of the persons at risk;

- assessment of each job’s risk;

- identification of control measures to reduce the risk;

- monitoring work areas to check that control measures are in place and effective;

- making employees aware of these risks through information, training and communications.

These measures are regulated by internal guidelines and procedures, which include, inter alia, the
documentation each operating unit is required to have, comprising the risk assessment document, operating

safety plans, emergency and evacuation plans, fire prevention and control plans and first aid plans.

The Employer and downstream (in line with the proxy system) the managers, officers and workers shall ensure
that health and safety management measures are in place. Specialist teams ensure their management in each
operating unit. Specific attention is given to training employees about specific duties and the operating controls

over work processes, performed either directly by the Group’s employees or subcontractors’ staff.

Training programmes are defined at operating unit level by the health and safety manager and approved by the
Employer, based on a risk assessment and the applicable legislative requirements. The training courses

provided to each worker cover at least the following issues:

= the health and safety organisation (Employer, health and safety manager, health and safety officers and
supervisors, company doctor and the workers’ safety representative), the legislative framework and an
overview of the management system;

= health and safety risks arising from the Group’s activities in general and the specific risks faced by the
workers;

« first aid and emergency management procedures (in particular, the fire fighting and evacuation plans).

The health and safety managers receive special information and training courses. The key topics are the legal-
regulatory framework, safety management and organisation, risk identification and measurement,

communication, training and discussions with workers.

The health and safety officers and supervisors undergo additional training to that provided to the workers on the
definition and identification of risk factors, incidents and near misses, techniques to communicate with and raise
the awareness of employees, checking that workers comply with the legal and internal rules and the use of

collective and personal protection equipment.
