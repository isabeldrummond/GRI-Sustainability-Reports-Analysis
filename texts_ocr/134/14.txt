Ongoing clean hydro energy projects contributed 17% to contract revenue, make up 26% of the construction
order backlog and a very impressive 51% of new orders, mostly thanks to the acquisition of the Snowy 2.0
contract in Australia.

Sustainable Mobility

growing GHG emitter with roughly 1 billion people still without access to viable roads all year round.

Passenger traffic is expected to increase by 50% by 2030 to then double by 2050 while, in the meantime, only
16% of global urban journeys takes place using public means of transport.

The Group is one of the key operators in the urban (metros and light rail) and non-urban (high speed railways)
sustainable mobility sectors as well as in the land transport infrastructure (roads and motorways), sea (ports,
navigable channels) and air (airports) sectors.
