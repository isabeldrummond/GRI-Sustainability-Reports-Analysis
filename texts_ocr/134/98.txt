Application and compliance: the internal procedures used to monitor application of the Code and the

Company policies

Salini Impregilo has issued a number of company policies, which alongside the Code of Ethics, represent the

main points of reference for people working for the Company. They are summarised below:

Sustainability: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with during its operations in order to
contribute to economic progress, social well-being and the environmental protection of the countries where it

operates.

Health and safety: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with to protect the health and
safety of its employees, suppliers and subcontractors during the entire life cycle of its contracts (design,

construction and development) and in the workplace; its objective is “zero injuries”.

Environment: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with in order to mitigate possible
adverse effects on the environment, protect the ecosystem and increase the beneficial effects, contributing

through its projects to resolving the main global environmental issues.

Quality: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with to ensure its client’s full satisfaction, the
active involvement of all stakeholders and ongoing improvement of the Quality System, based on its fundamental

goal of “build to perfection’.

Human rights: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with to ensure the protection of human
dignity, just and favourable conditions of work and the protection of the human rights of stakeholders affected

by its activities.

Equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with to

encourage inclusive work environments that value the individual, developing human capital.

Anti-corruption: the anti-corruption principles to be adhered to by employees, based on the fundamental tenet

of “zero tolerance”.

The Company strengthened its commitment to the environment, health and safety and human rights and workers
with the International Framework Agreement signed in 2014 with the Italian (Feneal-UIL, Filca-CISL and Fillee-
CGIL) and international (BWI - Building and Wood Workers’ International) trade unions of the construction

sector.

The above principles are reiterated in the Suppliers Code of Conduct, introduced early in 2020, through which
the Company extends its responsible operating practices to its supply chain. This Code is binding for all Salini
Impregilo’s suppliers and, together with the Code of Ethics, is an integral part of their contractual relationship

with the Company.
