Key audit matter Audit procedures addressing the key
audit matter

Considering the above, we believe that the

measurement of equity investments is a key

audit matter.

Other matters - Management and coordination

As required by the law, the company disclosed the key figures from the latest financial
statements of the company that manages and coordinates it in the notes to its own
separate financial statements. Our opinion on the separate financial statements of
Salini Impregilo S_p.A. does not extend to such data.

Responsibilities of the company’s directors and board of statutory auditors
(“Collegio Sindacale") for the separate financial statements

The directors are responsible for the preparation of separate financial statements that
give a true and fair view in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards endorsed by the European Union and the Italian regulations implementing
article 9 of Legislative decree no. 38/05 and, within the terms established by the Italian
law, for such intemal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.

The directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a
going concern and for the appropriate use of the going concem basis in the
preperason of tre scperate Snancial sistoments and for the adequacy of the related
disclosures. The use of this basis of accounting is appropriate unless the directors
believe that the conditions for liquidating the company or ceasing operations exist, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by
the Italian law, the company’s financial reporting process.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the separate financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with ISA Italia will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate financial statements.
