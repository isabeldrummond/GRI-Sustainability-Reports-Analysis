As already noted, the use of local suppliers allows the Group to minimise long-distance transport and, hence,

mitigate the related environmental effect.

Contributions to local economies

Direct contributions made by Salini Impregilo’s projects to local economies include employment and the use of
local suppliers. They are only part of the benefits as they do not include the additional indirect and induced effect

of the Group’s activities in the countries where it operates.

The Group has developed a proprietary calculation model, SEED (Socio-Economic Effects Determination)
model, to calculate its total contribution (direct, indirect and induced) to a country’s economic and social growth

in terms of employment, GDP, tax revenues and work income distributed to families?5.

The following graph presents the SEED model.

If just the Group’s main markets26 are considered, its average contribution to their economies, expressed as a

multiple, is as follows:

the Social Accounting Matrix published by leading international research bodies.
