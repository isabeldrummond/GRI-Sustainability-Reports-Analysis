Notes to the separate financial statements

1. Basis of preparation

Salini Impregilo S.p.A. has prepared its separate financial statements at 31 December 2019 on a going concern
basis. The directors have checked that events that could affect the company’s ability to meet its commitment in
the near future and, specifically, in the next 12 months do not exist. Preparation of separate financial statements
requires management to make judgements and complex estimates about the company’s future profitability and
financial position, based also on its sector. These complex estimates underpin assumptions about going concern
and the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and costs. They do not consider non-recurring events

that management cannot foresee at the date of preparation of the separate financial statements.

As required by Regulation no. 1606/2002 issued by the European Parliament and Council, implemented in Italy
by Legislative decree no. 38/2005, these separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) and endorsed by the European Union at 31 December 2019. They comprise a statement of financial
position, a statement of profit or loss, a statement of comprehensive income, a statement of cash flows, a

statement of changes in equity and these notes.

The separate financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost principle, except for those items

which are recognised at fair value in accordance with IFRS, as described in the section on “Accounting policies”.

The statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss are presented in Euros, whereas the
amounts in the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of cash flows, the statement of changes in

equity and these notes are shown in thousands of Euros, unless stated otherwise.
