With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the parent believes that it has
acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. When it deemed it appropriate to
settle the dispute, as explained earlier in more detail, it did so to avail of the various options provided for by the

Imprepar

After the Milan Regional Tax Commission filed a ruling at the end of March 2015 on the IRES assessment
notices for 2006/2007/2008 received by the subsidiary Imprepar cancelling all the main findings notified by the
tax authorities for a higher taxable amount of €12 million and the tax authorities’ appeal to the Supreme Court
made in November 2015 followed by the defence brief filed by the subsidiary, the subsidiary paid the first
instalment and applied the procedure for the out-of-court settlement of tax disputes introduced by article 6 of
Decree law no. 119 of 23 October 2018 converted into Law no. 136 of 17 December 2018. On 30 May 2019, it
presented its application for the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes (payment of €384

thousand) and opted for payment by instalment.

On 12 December 2017, as described above, Imprepar received an adjustment notice from the tax authorities
requesting payment of registration tax of approximately €1.3 million in addition to a fine of the same amount on
the parent’s sale of a business unit to it (which also received an identical adjustment notice). This business unit
had no future profits and held investments in consortium companies in liquidation or inactive and the related
assets and liabilities related to contracts that have been completed or are nearing completion transferred due to
Imprepar’s know how in managing this type of company. The subsidiary deems that the tax authorities’
allegations are ungrounded and has promptly appealed to the competent tax court. The dispute was settled with
a court-ordered settlement procedure as per article 48 of Legislative decree no. 546/1992 as proposed by the
tax authorities. This included a reduction in the registration tax and the fine from €1.3 million to €204 thousand

and from €1.3 million to €82 thousand, respectively.

On 18 June 2018, Imprepar received a notice to pay assessed registration tax of approximately €748,000. The
subsidiary has appealed promptly against the applicability of this notice to the competent tax commission which
accepted the subsidiary’s appeal and cancelled the notice to pay. Notification that the tax authorities have

appealed this ruling has not yet been received.

With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the subsidiary believes that it has
acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. When it deemed it appropriate to
settle the dispute, as explained earlier in more detail, it did so to avail of the various options provided for by the
relevant legislation, such as the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes or the positions
assigned to the tax collection agency, the court-ordered settlement procedure and the mutually-agreed

settlement procedure.
