The contingent consideration, included as part of the transfer price, is measured at acquisition-date fair value.

Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition-date fair value.

Goodwill is measured as the difference between the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of
any non-controlling interests (NCI) and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity
interest in the acquiree and the net fair value of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired
and the liabilities assumed. If the difference is negative, the resulting gain is recognised as a bargain purchase

in profit or loss.

NCI can be measured at fair value or at its proportionate share of the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree

at the acquisition date. The measurement method is decided on a transaction by transaction basis.
Business combination achieved in stages (step acquisition)

In the case of step acquisitions, the Group’s existing investment in the acquiree is measured at fair value on the
date that control is obtained. Any resulting adjustments to previously recognised assets and liabilities are
recognised in profit or loss. Therefore, the previously held investment is treated as if it had been sold and

reacquired on the date that control is obtained.
Transactions involving NCI

Changes to the investment percentage of a subsidiary that does not entail loss of control are treated as equity
transactions. Therefore, any differences between the acquisition price and the related share of equity in
subsequent acquisitions of investments in entities already controlled by the Group are recognised directly in
equity. With respect to partial disposals of an investment in a subsidiary while control is retained, any gain or

loss is recognised in equity.

use. The annual rates are as follows:
