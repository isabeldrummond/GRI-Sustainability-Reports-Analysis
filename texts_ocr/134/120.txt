Reference should be made to the Methodology for reporting non-financial information for details

The Company’s ongoing commitment to cultural issues (Safety Builders Program) and technical and system
aspects resulted in the ongoing improvement of its safety performance, which was confirmed by the roughly

25% decrease in the injury rate.

The following graph presents the LTIFR (the ratio of the total number of injuries leading to absence from work
in the period to the total number of hours worked, multiplied by 1,000,000) and its ongoing improvement in the

last six years.

A local investigation takes place for each injury. When the sick leave is for a period of more than 40 days, the
Corporate Safety, Environment and Systems Department and senior management from the relevant operating

department are involved in the investigation.

The objective is to identify the cause of the injury (root cause analysis) to prevent similar events occurring.
