With respect to the circular and green economy, 42% of the materials purchased complied with the region-based
criterion, as they were purchased within a radius of less than 160 km from the work sites, thus reducing the
impact of their transport. During 2019, the Group also used 15.1 thousand tonnes of fly ash (2018: 22.5 thousand
tonnes) and water recycled and re-used in production processes of 2.0 million cubic metres (2018: 4.0 million

cubic metres).

Energy consumption, both in the form of fossil fuels and electric energy, has a strong impact during construction
of infrastructure. Reduction of energy consumption and greater energy efficiency allow a decrease in GHG
emissions and mitigation of the effects of climate change. The “Climate change” section describes the Group’s

actions in this area.

Soil, subsoil and water environment

The Group’s construction activities may affect the soil and water environment at different levels depending on

the works in question and the surrounding environment (e.g., urban or rural environment).

Contracts are managed to avoid damaging these environmental components. Specifically, containment tanks,
wastewater conveying networks and waterproofing systems for risky logistic areas (e.g., workshops, fuel and
chemical depots) are built during the work site start-up phase to prevent contamination of the soil, subsoil and

surrounding water bodies.

Industrial wastewater is channelled and collected in sedimentation tanks and treatment plants designed to
comply with the applicable legal and contractual provisions, using the best technologies available, given the

wastewater’s specific characteristics.

Construction work also involves movement of large earth quantities to construct embankments, cuttings, tunnels
or certain types of dams. In accordance with the policy to reduce waste production, the excavated earth and
rocks are classified and stored on the sites for possible re-use within them, where possible and in compliance
with the regulations, or transferred to third parties to be re-used externally. In 2019, re-used excavated materials
amounted to 12.1 million cubic metres (2018: 18.1 million cubic metres), which is a very significant amount (58%

of the total) showing the effectiveness of the Group’s circular economy policies.

In order to mitigate the risk of soil erosion due to excavations and aggravated by weather events (rain, wind),
the Group takes specific soil protection measures consisting of systems to consolidate excavation fronts and to
channel rainwater, as well as covering more exposed areas (e.g., escarpments) and planting trees that mitigate
erosion. The mitigation measures are defined considering the natural elements, the environment and features
of the local area. In 2019, areas where measures to protect against erosion have been implemented covered

52.5 million square meters (2018: 6.5 million square metres).

Waste

Waste generated during construction of large-scale infrastructure can be grouped into two separate categories:
municipal waste and special waste. Municipal waste is generated by logistics sites where the support activities

for the industrial production are carried out such as offices, accommodation for non-resident workers and
