Salini Impregilo Group
31 December 2019

The directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going
concem and for the appropriate use of the going concern basis in the preparation of
the consolidated financial statements and for the adequacy of the related disclosures.
The use of this basis of accounting is appropriate unless the directors believe that the
conditions for liquidating the parent or ceasing operations exist, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

The Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by
the Italian law, the group's financial reporting process.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with ISA Italia will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISA Italia, we exercise professional judgement
— identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures

responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control;

— obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal control;

— evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;
