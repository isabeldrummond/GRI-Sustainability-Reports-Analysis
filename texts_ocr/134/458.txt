and employee benefits

The net increase in post-employment benefits in 2019 is due to both payments made during the year and
contributions transferred to the INPS treasury and other funds, as well as the accrual for the year and the
actuarial gains and losses recognised in the specific equity reserve, as required by IAS 19. Other changes are

mainly due to exchange differences.

An increase or decrease of 0.25% in the discount rate used to calculate the liability at 31 December 2019 would
have had a negative or positive effect of around €27 thousand or approximately €24 thousand, respectively. A
similar increase or decrease at 31 December 2018 would have had a negative or positive effect of approximately

€36 thousand or €37 thousand, respectively.
