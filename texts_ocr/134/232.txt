e The statement of profit or loss gives a classification of costs by nature and shows the profit or loss before
“Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on equity investments” and income taxes. The profit or
loss from continuing operations, the profit or loss from discontinued operations and the profit or loss
attributable to non-controlling interests and that attributable to the owners of the parent are also

presented.
e The statement of comprehensive income shows all non-owner changes in equity.

e The statement of cash flows presents the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities

separately. The indirect method is used.
Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by consolidating the financial statements at 31
December 2019 of Salini Impregilo, the parent, and the Italian and foreign companies which the parent directly

or indirectly controls.

Control exists when the Group has the power to govern, directly or indirectly, the financial and operating policies
of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Generally speaking, control is presumed to exist when the

Group holds more than half of the voting rights either directly or indirectly.

Entities or companies over which Salini Impregilo has joint control, by virtue of an investment therein or specific

contractual arrangements, are consolidated as follows pursuant to IFRS 11:
e ona line-by-line basis according to the investment percentage, if they are joint operations;
e at equity, if they are joint ventures.

In the case of some joint ventures, the financial reporting packages of consortia and/or consortium companies
prepared for their inclusion in the consolidated financial statements have not yet been approved by the
competent consortium bodies as they are waiting for the court-approved procedures of the consortium members
to be defined. When this is the case, the financial reporting packages are prepared using the best information

available.
Investments in associates are measured using the equity method.

The financial statements used for consolidation are modified (made consistent) and reclassified to comply with

the Group’s accounting policies in line with the currently applicable IFRS.

The financial statements used are expressed in the functional currency, being the local currency or another

currency in which most of the economic transactions and assets and liabilities are denominated.

Financial statements expressed in currencies other than the Euro are translated into Euros by applying the
closing rates to the statement of financial position items and the average annual rates to the statement of profit

or loss items, as these approximate the spot rates.

Differences arising from the translation of the opening equity using the closing rates and from the translation of
assets and liabilities at the spot rate and the statement of profit or loss items at the average annual rate are

taken to the translation reserve.
