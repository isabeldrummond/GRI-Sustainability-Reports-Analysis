Sirjo S.c.p.A. (Salini Impregilo investment: 40%) is the general contractor for the design-build contract signed

Jonica state highway 106 - Third maxi-lot

on 12 March 2012 for the third maxi-lot of Jonica state highway 106. The contract is worth approximately €980

million.

CIPE approved the definitive designs with resolution no. 3/2018 of 28 February 2018 published in the Italian
Official Journal no. 178 of 2 August 2018, which followed its previous resolution no. 41/2016 approving the
definitive designs for the first lot, published in the Italian Official Journal on 1 August 2017.

Sirjo S.c.p.A. sent the executive designs to the client on 15 April 2019 for checks by Conteco Check of the
quality, technical and financial adequacy and compliance with the ruling regulations. Conteco Check completed
its checks on 24 September 2019 and issued its report with a positive opinion. ANAS’ board of directors should

approve the executive designs by May 2020.

In addition, on 28 November 2019, ANAS sent the executive designs to the competent bodies so that they could
check their implementation/compliance and approval of the plan for the utilisation of excavated soil and rocks
(PUT, piano di utilizzo delle terre e rocce da scavo) pursuant to Legislative decree no. 161/2012. Given that no
comments were received within the legal limit of 90 days for the plan’s approval from the Ministry for the

Environment, Land and Sea (MATTM), work on the project can be commenced.

Once the Ministry has approved the plan and ANAS’ board of directors the executive designs, the site manager

can deliver the works, slated to take place during the second quarter of 2020.

The Group does not limit itself to infrastructure. It is also engaged in acquiring orders in the commercial building

 

ENI headquarters

sector, thus availing of development opportunities mostly created by the growth of Italy’s large metropolitan
areas. In partnership with a leading group of investors and acting as contractor, Salini Impregilo signed a contract
on 28 July 2017 for the building of ENI’s new headquarters in San Donato Milanese. This construction contract

is worth roughly €151 million (Salini Impregilo’s share: 60%).

Work began at the end of 2017 and continued in 2019 with construction of the three buildings. Activities for the

bulk of the project, such as the installation of the systems and facades, have been stepped up.

Negotiations with the customer about the internal finishings became more intense towards the end of the year
to be settled with a rider with a value of approximately €15 million. This will lead to an extension of the delivery

times of around six months.
