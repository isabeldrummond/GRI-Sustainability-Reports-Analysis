2. On 30 November 2015, the Office of the Prime Minister received a new claim form served by both Fibe and
other group companies involved in various ways in the activities performed in Campania for the waste

disposal service, containing claims for the damage suffered as a result of termination of the contracts in 2005.

The total amount claimed is €2,429 million. Considering that some requests are already included in other
proceedings, the net amount is €2,258 million. The Office of the Prime Minister filed a counterclaim for €845
million for reasons already included in other proceedings. The court appointed an expert to appraise the
subordinated claim filed by Fibe that prepared two alternative appraisals of the amount due to Fibe of
approximately €56 million or approximately €114 million. The competent judge handed down the ruling on
25 October 2019, finding that Fibe was due approximately €114 million and the Office of the Prime Minister
approximately €80 million. After offsetting the two amounts, the Office of the Prime Minister was ordered to
pay Fibe approximately €34 million plus interest accruing from 4 December 2015. At the date of preparation
of this report, Fibe is preparing its appeal to this ruling and is reasonably certain that most of its requests will
be accepted.

3. There is another proceeding commenced by the Office of the Prime Minister for the return of the advance of
approximately €52 million paid for the construction of the waste-to-energy plants (“WtE plants”). Fibe has
claimed that the receivables due from the Office of the Prime Minister, mostly for work performed on its behalf
and for the fees due to Fibe, would offset this advance. The first level hearing ended with ruling no. 4658/2019
in which the Naples Court only allowed part of Fibe’s receivables (the fees already collected by the Office of
the Prime Minister) for offsetting purposes, ordering the company to return the difference between the
advance collected and the receivables allowed for offsetting, with the result that Fibe owed roughly €10
million, plus interest, to the Office of the Prime Minister. This ruling is contrary to the report prepared by the
court-appointed expert which found that Fibe was due the entire amount of its receivables. Fibe has filed its
appeal. The above amount (approximately €10 million) could be offset against Fibe’s larger receivable of
€52,955 million plus interest as per the ruling described in the section on the administrative proceedings -

the USW Campania projects below.

Given the complexity and range of the different disputes disclosed in the previous sections, the Group cannot
exclude that events may arise in the future that cannot currently be foreseen which might require changes to

these assessments.
Panama Canal extension project

Certain critical issues arose during the first stage of full-scale production on the project to expand the Panama
Canal which, due to their specific characteristics and the materiality of the work to which they relate, made it
necessary to significantly negatively revise the estimates made during the early phases of the project. The most
critical issues related, inter alia, to the geological characteristics of the excavation areas, specifically with respect
to the raw materials required to produce concrete and the processing of such raw materials during normal
production activities. Additional problems arose due to the adoption by the customer of operational and
management procedures substantially different from those contractually agreed, specifically with regard to the
processes for the approval of technical and design solutions suggested by the contractor. These facts, which

were the subject of specific disclosures in previous reports published by the Group, continued in 2013 and 2014.
