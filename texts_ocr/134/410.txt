Finally, in the company’s reference sector, the objective of contractual outputs (milestones) refers to, inter alia,
modulation of cash flows to obtain financial resources useful to perform the contract and the definition of

technical specifications of the works and related performance timing.

4. Determining the transaction price

Given the engineering and operating complexities, the size and length of time involved in completing the
contracts, in addition to the fixed consideration agreed in the contract, the transaction price also includes
additional consideration, whose conditions need to be assessed. A claim is an amount that the contract seeks
to collect as reimbursement for costs incurred (and/or to be incurred) due to reasons or events that could not
be foreseen and are not attributable to the contractor, for more work performed (and/or to be performed) or

variations that were not formalised in riders.

The measurement of the additional consideration arising from claims is subject to a high level of uncertainty,
given its nature, both in terms of the amounts that the customer will pay and the collection times, which usually

depend on the outcome of negotiations between the parties or decisions taken by judicial/arbitration bodies.

This type of consideration is regulated by IFRS 15 as “contract modifications”. The standard provides that a
contract modification exists if it is approved by the parties to the contract. IFRS 15 provides that a contract
modification could be approved in writing, by oral agreement or implied by customary business practices. A
contract modification may exist even though the parties to the contract have a dispute about the scope or price
(or both) of the modification. The rights to the consideration shall be provided for contractually generating an
enforceable right. Once the enforceable right has been identified, in order to recognise the claims and amount
of the additional consideration requested, the company shall apply the guidance about the variable
consideration given in IFRS 15. Therefore, in order to adjust the transaction price to include the additional
consideration arising from the claims, the company shall decide whether it is highly probable that the revenue

will not be reversed in the future.

The company considers all the relevant aspects and circumstances such as the contract terms, business and

negotiating practices of the sector or other supporting evidence when taking the above decision.
4.a Optional works

The consideration for optional works is additional consideration for future works that have not yet been agreed

and/or ordered by the customer when it signs the contract.

The consideration for optional works is provided for in the contracts with the customer as it represents potential
future work interrelated with the main contract object. However, most of the contracts provide that the additional
works shall be specifically defined and approved by the customer before they start. Otherwise, the contractor

does not have an enforceable right to payment for this performance.

Accordingly and based on sector practices, this type of consideration is a contract modification and, under
IFRS 15, shall be considered when measuring the transaction price if approved by both parties to the contract.
In this case, the enforceable right can only be identified after specific approval or instructions from the customer

in line with its customary business practices or operating methods.
