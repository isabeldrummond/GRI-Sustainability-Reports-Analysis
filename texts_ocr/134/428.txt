The most significant changes include:

e _reclassifications of €37.2 million to right-of-use assets as a result of the application of IFRS 16 on 1 January
2019;

e increases of €25.0 million, chiefly related to investments made for the two Paris metro lines and the Rogun

Dam in Tajikistan;

e the reclassifications show the effect of the items recognised in “Right-of-use assets”.

5. Right-of-use assets

Right-of-use assets amount to €58.1 million and reflect the application of IFRS 16 using the modified
retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of the FTA is recognised in retained earnings at 1 January
2019. Therefore, the company has not restated the figures at 31 December 2018, presented in accordance with
IAS 17. More information about the application of the new standard is available in the section on “Changes in

standards”.
