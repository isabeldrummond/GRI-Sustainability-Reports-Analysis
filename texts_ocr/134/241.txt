The methods used by the Group to apply IFRS 15 are summarised below.
1. Identify the contract with a customer

The Group identifies and measures contracts with customers in line with IFRS 15 after they have been signed
and are binding, creating enforceable rights and obligations for the Group and the customer. The Group

considers the criteria of IFRS 15.9 set out below to identify the contract:

a) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally or in accordance with other customary

business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations;
b) the entity can identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred;
c) the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred;

d) the contract has commercial substance (i.e., the risk, timing or amount of the entity’s future cash flows is

expected to change as a result of the contract); and

e) it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods

or services that will be transferred to the customer.

2. Identifying performance obligations and allocating the transaction price

 

IFRS 15 identifies a performance obligation as a promise included in the contract with a customer to transfer:
a) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or b) a series of distinct goods or services

that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.

In the Group’s case, its performance obligation is usually the entire project. In fact, although the individual
performance obligations provided for in the contract are distinct, they are highly interdependent and integrated

as the contract provides for the transfer of the entire infrastructure to the customer.

However, certain contractual items include additional services that should be considered as distinct
performance obligations. For example, these may be post-completion maintenance services after final
inspection and additional or different contract warranties compared to those provided for by law or normal

sector practices .

When a contract has more than one performance obligation, the appropriate portion of the contract
consideration should be allocated to each separate performance obligation pursuant to IFRS 15. The Group's

contracts with customers usually specify the price of each contractual item (detailed in the contract).

3. Determining the criteria for satisfaction of the performance obligations and recognition of the revenue

 

IFRS 15 provides that revenue shall be recognised when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied
transferring the promised good or service (or asset) to the customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the

customer obtains control.

The Group’s contracts with customers are usually long-term contracts that include obligations to be satisfied
over time based on the progress towards completion and transfer of control of the asset to the customer over

time.
