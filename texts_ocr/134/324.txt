Lane Construction Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan

Through its US subsidiary Lane Industries Inc., the Group contributes to a pension plan that qualifies as a

defined benefit plan, The Lane Construction Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan, which pays benefits to

employees or former employees who met the related vesting conditions when they retire. The subsidiary also

pays benefits to a supplementary pension plan for some senior executives. In addition, it provides employees

who have reached retirement age with healthcare benefits. These employees were hired before 31 December

Construction Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan.
