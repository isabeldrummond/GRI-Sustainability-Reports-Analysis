The variations in the individual items compared to 2018 are due to the different cost structures that vary from
contract to contract and may, in some cases, entail changes in the industrial operating model from one year to
another. Moreover, as these are large-scale infrastructural works that take several years to complete, resort to
normal production factors depends on the stage of completion of each contract in any given year. These changes
may generate significant variations in the percentage of the related cost categories depending on the contract

and the year, while not affecting the total percentage of costs of total revenue.

Total 861,756 571,283 (290,473)

The decrease in the cost of raw materials and consumables is mainly related to the progress on the projects in

Dubai, Ethiopia and Poland.

35.2 Subcontracts

Costs of subcontracts increased to €1,774.0 million, up €115.5 million on 2018 as shown in the following table.

Total 1,658,505 1,773,965 115,460

 

 

The increase is mostly due to Lane Group’s contracts and the high speed/capacity Milan - Genoa railway line

section, partly offset by the smaller subcontracting costs of the contracts in Qatar which are nearly finished.
