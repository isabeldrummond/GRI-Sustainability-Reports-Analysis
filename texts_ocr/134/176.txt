Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programmes: Given the
type of works, their location and reference regulatory frameworks, the Group’s projects are subject to different

assessment prepared by the clients exists for 80% of its in-scope projects. The clients consulted the local
communities for 42% of the projects. A management system is in place to handle complaints from local
communities for 44% of the projects (the grievance mechanisms). Development projects assisting the local
