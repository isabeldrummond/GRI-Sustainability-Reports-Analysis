Shared development

The Group generates value in its works, its operations and its relations with internal and external stakeholders
and shares this value with its shareholders, investors, clients, employees, suppliers, institutions and local

communities.

The economic value generated and distributed is a widely-accepted indicator of the Group's contribution to its
stakeholders. It is also known as the social cash flow as it considers an organisation’s cash inflows and outflows
that affect its main stakeholders.

Value creation is measured as both the value generated by the Group (revenue and other inflows) and the value

distributed to its stakeholders® or retained by it for reinvestment.

6 The value distributed to stakeholders consists of dividends proposed by the board of directors to the shareholders as set out in this report.
