induction courses on internal policies and procedures for new employees, and courses on compliance
(companies’ administrative liability as per Legislative decree no. 231/2001 and anti-corruption), health and safety
(including the innovative Safety Builders course), languages, technical expertise, economic and financial issues,

team building and managerial development.

The Group also provides training through the E-Learning Academy, which deploys the new digital technologies
to provide e-learning courses, facilitating the sharing of technical and specialist knowledge. While classroom
courses and activities still take place, there are more on-line courses using virtual classrooms and webinars and

a vaster range of e-learning courses.

One of these e-learning courses introduced in 2019 is that on data security and cybersecurity, designed to
increase employees’ awareness of the risks of circulating information and, specifically, of cyber attacks and

cybercrime.

In 2019, new important training courses were planned for launch in 2020. They will be provided through the E-
Learning Academy and include, for example, the new e-learning course on anti-corruption and that on human

rights, designed to increase employees’ understanding of the related internal policies.

In 2019, the third edition of the master’s degree course “International Construction Management” at the Milan
Polytechnic, a leading university partner, was completed. The one-year course of 30,000 hours, held in English
and open to international students, offers a unique post-degree course as it combines mentoring, tutoring,
knowledge-based training, soft skills and professional training. Classroom lessons are mostly provided by Salini
Impregilo professionals with a six-month apprenticeship in Italy and abroad under the guidance of company
tutors to complete the course. Graduation Day took place on 27 September and the 15 students (33%
international students, 40% female students - additional proof of the Company’s ongoing commitment to
promoting the training and professional careers of newly graduated female engineers) presented their

dissertations to the scientific commission.

Salini Impregilo also invests in the professional development of its employees around the world in order to
ensure their performance meets the Group’s technical, qualitative, environmental and health and safety

standards and so that it has qualified personnel for its ongoing and future projects.

Accordingly, projects include professional training courses for the local workforce, defined using parameters that
identify the training requirements and needs for each position. Employees must attend the specific training

course identified for their roles and requirements (both classroom and on-site).

These courses avoid the risk that employees’ technical, professional and managerial skills become obsolete as

this could affect the productivity, efficiency and safety of their jobs.

Training hours (classroom and on-site) provided in 2019 covered many aspects (health and safety, the
environment, quality, technical/specialist, compliance, management, etc.) for a total of 252,357 hours. These
courses were supplemented by important safety courses provided directly in the work sites. During 2019, the
Group carried out more than 105 thousand Tool Box Talks (short meetings on safety-related aspects, around
88 thousand, and the environment, roughly 17 thousand, held at the start of work shifts) at its work sites, equal

to more than 290 a day.
