CEO’S LETTER TO THE STAKEHOLDERS

To all the Shareholders and Stakeholders of Salini Impregilo Group (Webuild)

We ended this year achieving very challenging targets that were important to our growth.

In a complex and changing global context, we continued to pursue our clear-eyed business plan, laying the
groundwork for the Group’s next step to serve its international and domestic markets with increasing efficiency,

generating value for all our stakeholders that have placed their trust in us.

After our successful growth transactions of the past few years, including the acquisition of Lane in the United
States, 2019 was the year of Progetto Italia, our project to create a large Italian infrastructure operator, partly
through aggregations. This industrial transaction was made possible also thanks to the support of our new
shareholder, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), and major Italian banks (Intesa Sanpaolo, Unicredit and BPM).
Our goal is to kick-start the domestic construction sector, starting with the re-opening of the blocked work sites,
together with CDP and the banks to create development opportunities for Italy and jobs in the north and

especially in the south of Italy.

Progetto Italia is designed to shore up Italy’s depressed infrastructure sector and its top notch contractors. By
blending their vast expertise and incredible experience with our skills, we can relaunch an industrial sector that
has great potential and give birth to a group well placed to compete on a constantly growing global market, that
has a common set of values and can invest in technological innovation and systems as well as the safety of its

workers.

To prepare for this challenge, we introduced tailored measures to continue our growth, including a capital
increase, the sale of non-core assets and the consequent generation of cash inflows, derisking and a better
overheads/turnover ratio. We also reorganised our internal processes and invested in training for our employees

and the new generations who will work in the construction sector.

We are well aware that the global challenges on the international stage posed by climate change, the increasing
scarcity of natural resources, a growing global population and ongoing urbanisation require a coordinated

response by all stakeholders and an unprecedented mobilisation of resources.

These global challenges also offer a great opportunity for us and our sector, with enormous investments
earmarked by governments and international financial institutions for the next few years. According to G20
Global Infrastructure Outlook estimates, at global level, investments of roughly USD77 trillion will be needed to
2040 for just the business areas our Group operates in, i.e., energy, water and mobility infrastructure, and this

figure includes approximately USD62 trillion that has already been budgeted for.

In order to turn these challenges to our advantage, we have drawn up a business strategy underpinned by three
pillars: specialisation in large projects, focus on fast growing countries with a low risk profile and concentration
on sectors closely linked to sustainable development and that offer the best development opportunities for

infrastructure, directing global growth.

To achieve this strategy, we have strengthened our business model in pursuit of greater operating efficiency,
technological innovation and responsible conduct. We have also invested in an ambitious growth plan to better

compete with large international players on the global stage and at home.
