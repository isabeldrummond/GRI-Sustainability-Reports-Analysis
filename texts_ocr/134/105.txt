characteristics and energy output, plants, costs, safety, maintenance, lifecycle, demolition and

decommissioning.

During 2019, the Company extended the use of this virtual model to the security area, reproducing the work
environments to identify and categorise the risk factors. The simulation of critical areas and processing and the
identification of restricted access zones allows Salini Impregilo to analyse risks before they arise and thus

prevent them.

Materials

The more important studies carried out in recent years are those for the mixes for the concrete used to build the

dams in Ethiopia and Namibia.

Specifically, the R&D activities identified optimised mixes, with a low cement content, for the GERD project in
Ethiopia. This enabled a saving of more than 200 thousand tonnes of cement and, in turn, a saving in
transportation. As a result, the study will allow a reduction in the project's carbon footprint of over 290 thousand

tonnes of COz.

An on-site production process was developed at the same work site for concrete admixtures which avoided their
purchase and related transportation from abroad (i.e., Europe). This will lead to lower transport emissions of

roughly 27 thousand tonnes of COz.

In Namibia, the Group developed a special concrete mix using fly ash instead of cement, which meant more
than 21 thousand tonnes less cement was used, reducing the project's carbon footprint by over 14,500 tonnes

of COz,

Energy efficiency

One of the most important projects carried out in the three-year period was that launched in 2017 to develop
“Construction 4.0” electrical systems. The study involved an innovative system to monitor a work site’s electrical
parameters and obtain a detailed analysis of the power quality to improve the work site’s electrical and energy

performances.

The project entailed a feasibility study and the design and engineering of new systems and technologies for

energy efficiency.

In 2018, the work site for the Isarco River Underpass section (Italy), which is the south lot of the Brenner Base
Tunnel contract, was the first pilot site to test this technology. The new equipment installed at the logistics base
showed an improvement of roughly 8% in electrical efficiency with the related proportionate reduction in
consumption and, therefore, greenhouse gases (GHG). The analysis of the results for the first three months

showed that the work site saved roughly €12 thousand with around 30 tonnes of COzemissions avoided in 2019.
