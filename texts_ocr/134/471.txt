Fair value measurement hierarchy

IFRS 7 requires that the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position be
classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair value.

There are three different levels:
e Level 1 - Fair values measured using quoted prices in active markets;

e Level 2 - Fair values measured using valuation techniques for which inputs significant to the fair value

measurement are based on observable market data;

e Level 3 - Fair values measured using valuation techniques for which inputs significant to the fair value

measurement are based on unobservable market data.

Financial instruments recognised by the company at fair value are classified as follows:
