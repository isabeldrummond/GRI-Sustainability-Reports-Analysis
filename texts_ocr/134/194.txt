filed their definitive report. The expert found that the joint venture’s claims of approximately €3 million were

admissible. A decision has not yet been taken.

The directors are confident that joint venture’s arguments will be accepted supported by the opinion of their legal

advisors.

Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the joint venture has accordingly presented its request for additional
consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed

highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors.

Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable

events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date.
Colombia - Yuma and Ariguani

Yuma Concesionaria S.A. en Reorganizacion (in which the Group has a 48.3% investment) (“Yuma”) holds the

concession for the construction and operation of sector 3 of the Ruta del Sol motorway in Colombia.

The construction works were delivered to the EPC contractor Constructora Ariguani S.A.S. en Reorganizacion,

wholly owned by the parent, on 22 December 2011.

In November 2017, the customer ANI (Agencia Nacional de Infraestructura) commenced administrative

procedures against Yuma to have the contract terminated.

the project before the International Chamber of Commerce as part of the international arbitration.

Salini Impregilo concurrently withdrew its application for arbitration to the International Chamber of Commerce,
presented in November 2017. As a result and with the acceptance by ANI, this international arbitration

proceeding has been discontinued.

At the same time, two other riders to the EPC contract were signed by Yuma and the EPC contractor Ariguani,

covering the new financial terms and timeline agreed by them.

Due to the dispute and the difficulties encountered during the project, in 2018, both Yuma and Ariguani
commenced their reorganisation (“Reorganizacién”) pursuant to the local laws (Law no. 1116 of 2006) and this

process is still ongoing.

The Group had already provided for the higher costs incurred by Ariguani for the contract variations, unexpected

events and delays accumulated during the project in previous years to the extent that acceptance thereof is
