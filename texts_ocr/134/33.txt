Performance by geographical area

Italy

The Group operates in the construction segment in Italy, mostly in the areas of sustainable mobility and green

buildings, and the concessions segment.

Reference context and macroeconomic scenario

Italy is ranked 30th in the SDB Global Rank, the index that measures progress towards achievement of the
SDGs in 162 countries around the world. Italy shows progress in the majority of the goals that are most pertinent
to the Group’s business areas although it still faces tough challenges with respect to, in particular, mobility and

the fight against climate change.

From an economic standpoint, after a positive 2018 when GDP increased by 0.8%, external and internal factors
materialised holding back the Italian economy’s growth. They include uncertainty about the weak global
economy as well as internal factors such as the low private consumption levels, small tax revenue and weak
industrial production. According to the IFM’s most recent projections of March 2020, economic growth is
estimated to be 0.3% in 2019.

According to the estimates published by the IMF on 20 March 2020, GDP is expected to decrease by 0.6% while
public debt will rise to 137% of GDP and the deficit to 2.6%. These estimates only partly reflect the effects of the

Coronavirus.

According to the 2020 construction market report issued by CRESME, an Italian research centre, investments
in public works will grow by 5.5% in 2019, after growth of 2.3% in 2018.

This growth is mainly triggered by investments in transport infrastructure (railways, roads, ports, airports and
metros), including crucial infrastructure which is already under construction and is of strategic interest to the
country. The main growth stimuli are the public sector’s renewed spending ability (its gross capital expenditure
is projected to increase throughout the period from 2019 to 2022) and the amendments to the sector regulations

with the decree to mobilise work sites (the “Decreto Sblocca-Cantieri’).
