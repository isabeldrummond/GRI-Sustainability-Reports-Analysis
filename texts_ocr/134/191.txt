regards the civil action in Italy, Salini Impregilo and all the members of Eurolink have jointly and separately asked
that SDM be ordered to pay the amounts due, for various reasons, as a result of the termination of the contract

for reasons not attributable to them (€657 million).

With its ruling no. 22386/2018 issued on 16 October 2018, the Rome Court rejected the applications filed by the
claimants and the counterclaims filed by SDM. Conversely, the Rome Court declared that the customer’s
termination of the contract with Parsons Transportation Group Inc., engaged by SDM for the project
management services, was legitimate (referring calculation of the compensation for damage to Parsons to the
judgment of the Constitutional Court). As the process is joined to that of Eurolink, Salini Impregilo deems that

the legal approach which led to the ruling in the latter case is, mutatis mutandis, also applicable to Eurolink.

Eurolink and Salini Impregilo filed their appeal against this ruling before the Rome Appeal Court on 28 December

2018. The appeal hearing is at an initial stage.

In the meantime, the Constitutional Court found the issue of legitimacy of the Decree law for Parson’s position
to be inadmissible as the order for its re-examination by the court was insufficiently documented and not
because it found that the amount of the compensation to be irrelevant or unfounded. The Rome Court will now

have to review the application and possibly defer it again to the Constitutional Court.

The Constitutional Court’s ruling does not affect the Appeal Court’s hearing about constitutionality refiled by

Eurolink.

Given the complexity of the pending proceedings, while the experts assisting Salini Impregilo and the general
contractor are confident about the positive outcome of the legal actions and recovery of the outstanding assets
(mainly contract assets recognised for this project), they cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events

may arise which would require changes to the assessments made to date.
Orastie - Sibiu motorway

In July 2011, Salini Impregilo commenced work on the highway contract to build the Orastie - Sibiu section (Lot

3), which included 22.1 km of two lane highway in each direction (in addition to the emergency lanes).

The contract was entered into with the Romanian National Road & Highways Company (“CNAIR”) and 85%

financed with EU structural funds and 15% by the Romanian government.

Progress on the contract has been adversely affected by a number of events outside Salini Impregilo’s control

such as unpredictable vast landslides on approximately 6.6 km of the route.

Despite this, the lot was delivered to the customer and opened to the traffic on 14 November 2014 while

additional work made necessary by the landslides was still under completion.

Notwithstanding the first favourable ruling by the DAB and the award of approximately €6 million to the Group,

the customer refused to acknowledge the unpredictable nature of the landslides and to pay the amounts due.
In June 2015, the Group stopped work due to non-payment of the amounts awarded to it by the DAB.

In September 2015, Salini Impregilo presented an application for arbitration and the first partial award of €18

million was issued in March 2017 which it subsequently collected.
