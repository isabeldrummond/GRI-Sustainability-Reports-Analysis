“Other income” mostly refers to ongoing contracts and specifically industrial activities and related works not
directly related to contracts with customers. The increase of €25.8 million is mainly due to the cost recharges to
non-controlling consortium members (other income in the consortium’s financial statements), mostly related to
COCIV. Salini Impregilo Group’s activities involve its participation in numerous SPEs that, especially in Italy,
use the consortium structure, which works using a cost recharging system whereby the costs incurred by the
SPE are invoiced to the consortium members in line with their investment percentages. As this income does not

arise on the performance of the contract obligations or contract negotiations, it is recognised as “Other income”.

On 19 December 2019, Condotte’s interest in COCIV was reduced to the minimum (the paragraph “Change in

Condotte’s interest in COCIV* in note 4 provides more information about this).

35. Operating expenses

Operating expenses for the year amount to €4,873.2 million compared to €5,129.6 million for 2018.

The item may be broken down as follows:

28 a) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally or in accordance with other customary business practices) and
are committed to perform their respective obligations; b) the entity can identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be
transferred; c) the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred; d) the contract has commercial substance
(i.e., the risk, timing or amount of the entity’s future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract); and e) it is probable that

the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.
