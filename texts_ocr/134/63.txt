Risk management system

The context in which the Group currently operates, characterised by rapid macroeconomic changes, financial
markets’ instability and progressive developments of legal and regulatory compliance regulations, and affected
by megatrends such as climate change, resource scarcity and increasing urbanisation in the medium to long-

term, requires clear strategies and effective management processes aimed at preserving and maximising value.

As part of its internal controls and risk management system, the Group has a risk management framework,
which it keeps up-to-date, is an integral part of internal procedures and is extended to all operating companies

to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks in accordance with industry best practices.

Development, implementation and circulation of the risk management framework (presented in the following
chart) is designed to assist senior management with strategic and commercial planning and operations through
the comprehensive, in-depth analysis of relevant factors for the Group’s business, the local contexts in which it
operates and the particular operating requirements of its individual contracts, facilitating the identification and

monitoring of related risks, be they economic, financial or non-financial (sustainability or ESG risks).

During 2019, the Group focused on strengthening its methods and tools to analyse contract risk during the
bidding stage and to continuously include procedures for the efficient management of the most significant risks,
such as country and counterparty risks (involving, therefore, clients, partners, subcontractors and significant
suppliers). It also implemented procedures to analyse and manage economic, financial and non-financial risks

in more depth, both at contract and corporate level.

These procedures and the Group’s ongoing development of the frameworks allow it to promptly and carefully

analyse its risk profile and identify how to manage those more relevant risk events with tailored measures.
Business risks

External risks are those that may compromise the Group’s achievement of its objectives, i.e. all events whose

occurrence is not influenced by corporate decisions. This category includes all risks arising from a country’s
