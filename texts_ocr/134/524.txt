Salini Impregito SpA
31 December 2019

As part of an audit in accordance with ISA Italia, we exercise professional judgement
and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

— identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opanion. The riak of not detocing a material

misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control;

— obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s intemal control;

— evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;

— conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concem basis
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on
the company’s ability to continue as a going concem. If we conclude that a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report

statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance, identified at the appropriate
level required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies
in intemal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have
complied with the ethics and independence rules and standards applicable in Italy and
communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine
those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the separate financial
statements of the current year and are, therefore, the key audit matters. We describe
these matters in our auditors’ report.
