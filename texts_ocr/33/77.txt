Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

The main types of training courses promoted by the

Group in 2018 were the following:

+ Training on health and safety issues, related to
learning and up-dating of the regulations required
by the law and/or the company in relation to health
and safety in the workplace.

+  Trainingrelatedtospecificissues ofthe quality control
system in order to learn the operative procedures

necessary in every phase of the production process;

+ Technical and specialist training to increase the
skills necessary to carry out the task that has been
assigned;

+ _ Linguistic training in order to increase the linguistic
skills of the resources involved;

+ Computer training in order to acquire the skills
necessary to be competent in the use of computers
(for example, knowledge of some types of software);

+ _ Training for newly hired employees;

+ On the job training usually conducted for a specific
Period in the company by other qualified employees.

Although the training courses are not centrally
coordinated they are defined annually by each company
and besides the obligatory training that must be offered,
they make a note of the specific issues which need to be
dealt with and, in some of the companies, the employees
may request to participate in specific training courses to
enrich and personalize their curriculum.

For the purpose of promoting a greater sense of
responsibility in their employees, this year the Parent
Company and some of its subsidiaries organized courses
related to information about the Organizational Model
and administrative responsibility of legal persons as per
ex D.Lgs. 231.

Despite the fact that at this time in the Group there is
no specific training related to human rights issues, we
are, in any case, committed to the dissemination and
application of the Ethics Code containing principles
of legality, loyalty, correctness, transparency and
professionalism on which the behavior of every person
belonging to the Group must adhere; in the main Italian

companies of the Group, the Ethics Code is given to all

78

 

newly hired personnel as an obligatory document. In
the Chinese subsidiaries during the training of the new
employees they focus on the Ethics Code which has been
translated into Chinese and approved by the Boards of
the two companies.

In the Sustainability Plan we have set the objective of
including, starting already next year, a specific training
course related to human rights and their protection,
particularly in those countries where the legislation in this

sense is not so severe as it is in Italy; we are also planning

training sessions related to issues of sustainability.
