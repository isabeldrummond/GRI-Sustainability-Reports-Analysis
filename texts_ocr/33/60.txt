Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

In relation to this, the suppliers are asked to meet certain

requirements:

+ Financial soundness;

. Experience in the sector;

+ â€” Reliability;

+ Technical and planning resources and capacity;

+ Manufacturing capacity;

+ Use of systems for the control of the quality and
safety of the products, consistent with the requests
of the Group.

In the selection process and in their relations with the

suppliers, the Group evaluates, consistent with the internal

procedures and the company program, the economic

benefits in reference to the objectives of solvency and long
term profitability, as well as the presence on the market, the

technical capacity and the reliability of the persons involved.

In particular, for the manufacturing companies of the Group
the selection of the suppliers follows a precise procedure of
qualification and approval to guarantee the quality of the
product and the respect of the delivery times. According
to this procedure, using a "Supplier Qualification Request
Form" we evaluate the general level of the Quality Control
System of the supplier, with an aim to constantly improve
the aspects which influence the quality of the product
or the service which we are buying; for purchases of
merchandise we also make trial orders which allow us to
conduct inspections directly on the product.

For products and services of a certain kind, like the services
offered by testing laboratories, the qualifying procedure and
approval is based mainly on the analysis of the certifications
that the supplier possesses, because the authority of the
certifications and of the institutions that have issued them
are a guarantee of reliability. Occasionally we also conduct
audits at the supplier's; at the end of the analysis, on the
basis of the results of all the tests that have been run, the
supplier will either be included or excluded if his quality
level is found to be insufficient.

In the Sustainability Plan, the Group is committed to
inserting, in the next few years, as part of the qualification
procedure for the approval of suppliers, also an evaluation
of some aspects related to issues of sustainability so that
they can be used as parameters and contribute to the
overall evaluation of the supplier.

Once the supplier has been judged to be suitable
from a qualitative point of view, periodic inspections are
programmed to make sure that the standards of quality
required have been maintained: these evaluations take
into consideration aspects such as flexibility of the
supplier, ie. his capacity to adapt to the requirements

of the organization, the speed of response to and the
management of contingencies, the organizational structure
and punctuality of deliveries as well as the evaluation of
the merchandise delivered. Annual inspections are also
conducted at some supplier's by specially trained internal
auditors, both routinely or on account of an anomalous
situation of non-conformity, like a decline in the quality of
the product or services.
