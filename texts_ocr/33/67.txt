5.3 USE OF LASER INTHE CONSERVATION OF THE WORLD'S

ARTISTIC HERITAGE

The beauty of works of art is our legacy for future generations and it is our duty to
preserve it for them. We are proud to be the first company in the world to produce
laser created specifically for the restoration of works of art using the same technology
used for medicine and surgery. Whether we are dealing with works of art or with
medicine, the principle is the same: taking care of people, our works of art.prenderci

cura delle persone, i nostri capolavori.

One of the flagship products made by the EI.En. Group
is represented by the small segment of restoration;
over the years the sensitivity of the Group towards the
conservation of works of art has continued to grow and
has inspired research aimed at making the most advanced
conservation technologies available for the restoration of
artistic masterpieces all over the world. The Group has
continued to experiment with new technologies that
can offer conservation processes that are increasingly
effective and respectful of the works of art.

In fact, lasers offer a solution which is effective, reliable
and safe for the conservation of the world's cultural
heritage and give new life to the masterpieces that
have left an indelible mark on the history of humanity.
Restoration with lasers respects the original surface and
the texture of the art work because, by using a non-
invasive procedure respecting the original structure
of the work this method makes it possible to remove
the patina that has formed over the centuries so that
the public can admire the works of art restored to their
original state.

Roman frescoes, Egyptian statues, pre-Columbian
textiles and remains of Renaissance bronzes have been
brought back to their original splendor and displayed to
the public. Lasers, in fact, can be used for cleaning works
of art and architectural elements in stone that have
been degraded by encrustations, in the conservation
procedures of metal artifacts of archeological and artistic
interest like bronze and gilded surfaces, for cleaning
silver objects, both antique and modern, and also for the
cleaning of wooden artifacts.

Some of the most important restorations we have
performed with our lasers are listed below:

+ Cleaning of some of the marble facades of the
Baptistery of San Giovanni in Florence;

Nord of the Baptistery of San Giovanni by Ghiberti;
