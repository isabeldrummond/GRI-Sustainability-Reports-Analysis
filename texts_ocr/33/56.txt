4.2 QUALITY AND SAFETY OF OUR PRODUCTS

The Group is aware that the complexity of its business requires high qualitative
standards and for this reason the commitment that we have and we promote
for the quality and safety of our products is essential in order to guarantee
continued growth and success. We have always focused on the phases of design
and development of our systems; in fact, our value is created through the study
and application of methods that are increasingly selective, effective and safe.

Every day we are committed to supplying products of
value to our clients in such a way as to create loyalty that
is based on quality, reliability and safety and to guarantee
these requirements for the product are recognized and
appreciated and that every measure be adopted to make
sure that they are in conformity with the law.

To this purpose, some companies of the Group have
equipped themselves with an Integrated Management
System Manual which is in compliance with TUSSL n. 81
of 2008, to describe the objectives and the policies of the
Management System for Quality and the ways in which
it should be applied. The manual defines the general
criteria needed to satisfy the requirements for safety and
performance of products during their entire life cycle, as
well as the services supplied.

ELEn. S.p.A., Deka M.E.L.A. S.rl., Quanta System S.p.A.,
ASA S.r.l. and Asclepion GmbH also use a Quality Policy
which guarantees the conformity of the activities to the

regulations of the institutions in the country in which
they operate.

located and the type of business they run, the different
companies of the Group comply with the standards and
regulations shown below.
