Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

locating, among the various company functions, the
responsibilities connected with the issues of health and
safety, the mapping and self-evaluation of risks, the
implementation of training programs.

For the companies located in the area of Calenzano, the
central role of the HSE office in the management of safety
has, over time, given us a more consistent and uniform
vision of the company policies in relation to this issue.

In all of the manufacturing companies there is a
plan for a procedure for identifying risks related to
safety and health of the workers: in Italy this activity is
codified in the Risk Evaluation Document (DVR); in the
Chinese companies the risks related to the workplace
are formalized and communicated to the workers by
means of the "Worker's Manual"; also in the German
and Brazilian subsidiaries, the analysis of the risks is
formalized is specific documents which are periodically
up-dated. The identification of the risks precedes the
identification and implementation of the corrective
and/or preventive actions. Most of the subsidiaries have
adopted a procedure for reporting of risks by workers
and they have elected safety representatives among the
workers.

During this year the Italian companies of the Group held

periodic meetings in conformity with art.35 of D.Lgs.

81/08, in which the employer, the company doctor, the

RSPP (Manager of Prevention and Protection Services)
and the RSL (Workers' Safety Representative) attend and
represent all of the workers. In line with a policy of the
greatest transparency, in the periodic meeting of the
Parent Company a member of the Supervising body is
invited to participate as well as all of the persons who are
members of the company safety staff.

During the meeting the following subjects are discussed:

- up-dating of any modifications to be made to the risk
evaluation document;

- evaluation of the trend in the number of injuries,
professional diseases and health supervision;

- selection criteria, technical characteristics, and
effectiveness of the individual protective devices which

have been added or modified;

- safety information and training programs for executives,
middle managers and workers.

During each meeting a new, improved safety program
is explained, in which they describe all of the objectives
that the Prevention and Protection Services have set to
achieve the next year.

The German and Brazilian companies also have specific
commissions dealing with health and safety which meet
periodically to evaluate the management of these issues.
