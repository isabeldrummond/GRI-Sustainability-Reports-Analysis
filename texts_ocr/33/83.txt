6.3 THE WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE

The welfare of our people is a key factor in the success of the Group. In fact,
technical skills are not enough to guarantee a good result; it is necessary for the
company to offer its employees an environment that can stimulate their potential

and their ability.

To support, promote and implement the welfare of our
people the El.En. Group considers welfare an innovative
instrument with respect to the traditional types of
remuneration and incentive and it is destined to become
an integral part of a modern and efficient management
of resources. Welfare programs are now planned by the
Japanese subsidiary and two of the Chinese subsidiaries.
The Italian companies of the Group, in compliance with
the CCNL of the sector which is applied, issue a part of
the remuneration in flexible benefits. In particular for
the companies at the headquarters in Calenzano, by
using a specific platform, every employee may chose
the benefit or the service which he/she deems most
suitable for their interests and needs, like, for example,
the expenses for assistance at home, and health services,
reimbursement for school expenses, supplementary
pension provisions, training courses, recreation, goods
in kind, and collective transportation services. Moreover,
by means of a company agreement that was signed just

a few months ago, it will be possible starting next year to
convert up to 50% of the amount owed to the employee
as a performance bonus into welfare services e/o goods.
With this agreement, the companies have also offered
improved treatment with respect to the CCNL now in
force by guaranteeing an extra day of paid leave on
the occasion of the birth of a child with respect to that
offered by the present regulations and moreover, the
first three days of absence for an illness of not more than
five days will be remunerated 100% even after the third
reoccurrence. The subsidiary Quanta System S.p.A. in the
second level agreement introduced the possibility for
each employee to convert the entire performance bonus
into welfare.

As determined by collective bargaining the Italian
companies adhere to health care funds for all of their
employees.

For the employees of the companies in Calenzano, the

Group has always offered free cafeteria service.
