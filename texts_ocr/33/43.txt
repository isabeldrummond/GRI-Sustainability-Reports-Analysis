Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

 

The analysis therefore started with the mapping of the

activities and the identification of the risk related to each
of them by attributing a certain number of points. The
parameters used for the point system were: the number
of times it had happened in the past, the existence of
company procedures, the impact of the penalties for
this type of crime and the frequency of the event. We
decided that the frequency of the event and the impact
of the penalties made it opportune to dedicate a part of
the Organizational Model to all the preventive activities
related to this kind of crime, even if the occurrence
in the past (no event of this type has taken place) and
the existence of company procedures lowered the risk.
The Ethics Code also contains precise directives related
to correct behavior which are intended to avoid the
occurrence of corruption. In 2018, no cases or reports of
corruption were registered.

In order to guarantee the principles contained in the
Ethics Code and the effective implementation of the
systems for the flow of information and controls described
in Model 231 the companies of the Group that initiated it
make use of a Supervising Body which is appointed by

the Board of Directors; The main duty of the Supervising
Body is that of monitoring and, when necessary, reporting
to the Board of Directors any irregularity or violation, and
to supervise the respect of the procedures set up by the
Company, as part of the prevention plan of the so-called
assumption crimes, identified after an in-depth analysis
which includes corporate crimes and crimes related to
health and safety in the workplace.

The EI.En. Group believes that the knowledge of and
adherence to the principles of the Model 231 Ethics
Code must be promoted also through specific training
programs for the people who work for the organization:
starting this year, for some of the companies that are
located in Calenzano, we have begun a specific training
program based on Model 231 and conducted by the
members of the Supervising Body for a total of 110 hours
of training which involved 65 employees. For the Chinese
subsidiaries instead, there is a specific training program
regarding the Ethics Code of the Group for all the newly
hired employees. Activities will continue to disseminate
in greater detail information on these issue within the
organization.
