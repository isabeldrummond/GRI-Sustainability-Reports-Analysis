For the activity of research and development in the
medical sector, the principal areas of development for -

the Group are the following:

+ Clinical experimentation for the extension of the

treatment (the ONDA system, released for sale in
May of 2018);

Preliminary study, development and designing of
multi-functional platforms for dermatological and
aesthetic applications;

Preliminary study, development and designing of
systems which integrate and improve the existing
laser technology for hair removal applications.

applications of “Mona Lisa Touch” laser treatments In the industrial sector the Group has conducted the
to reduce the effects of the atrophy of vaginal — following activities:

mucous, an extremely important application in uro-
gynecology and urology; .

+ Research and clinical experimentation on the effects
of laser applications to biological tissue including
laboratory studies of biological samples and cell
cultures; experimentation on the wave length of
laser emissions for which the theoretical models
include a particularly effectiveness in the treatment
of some dermatological pathologies or in general in
the human body.

+ Research for new clinical applications using the laser
in dermatology (cutaneous ulcers and diabetic feet).
The healing of chronic ulcers, for example, is based
on the unique characteristics offered by the laser
beam during the cleaning phase of the wound and
on the capacity for bio-stimulation operated by the
laser light itself, which activates the cells and favors
the regeneration of the skin cells.

+ Development of newlaser systems and improvement
of those already developed, with emission of
impulses lasting pico-seconds for dermatological *
applications;

+ Completion of the development of a new system
based on micro-waves as a highly efficient form
of energy for the reduction of subcutaneous fat +
in various parts of the body using a non-invasive

Development of innovative processes for pre-
cutting and micro-perforation of labels in a machine.
Development of software and algorithms for
advanced high-speed coding in the sector of digital
converting.

Increase in the maximum power of laser sources
in the RF range maintaining a high-quality and
modularity of the beam; development of innovative
applications (for example, micro-perforation of
panels and special applications in the field of digital
converting) made possible by the technology;
Research to improve the management and focalizing
of the laser beam for high-powered sources in fiber;
Continual improvement in the applicative processes
of sheet metal cutting aimed at improving the
efficiency, speed, and versatility for cutting larger
thicknesses through the opportune management of
the high powers available.

Experimentation and multi-disciplinary research
(electronics, optics, fluid-dynamics) for the
optimization of the potential of the laser system for
flat cutting of sheet metal;

Improvement of the performance of the
galvanometric components of the scanning systems.
