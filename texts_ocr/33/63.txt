5.1 USES AND BENEFITS OF LASERS IN THE MEDICAL SECTOR

The use of our medical and aesthetic lasers and the continued commitment we
dedicate to research and development of new or improved applications generates
a series of indirect social impacts which are transformed into benefits both for the

patient and for the local community.

With our laser systems for the medical and aesthetic field
we have placed at the disposal of the market instruments
and solutions which improve the welfare of people and
the quality of life of patients by reducing health issues of
both a physical and aesthetic nature, and the those of a
psychological nature associated with them. The laser is,
in fact, a device which, thanks to its inherent selectivity
treats the pathologies by maximizing the effectiveness
of the interaction and minimizing the collateral effects of
the treatments.

If we consider, for example, the surgical sector, the
equipment that has been conceived and developed by
the Group for minimally invasive surgery has brought
about an improvement in the quality of life for the
patients in terms of a greater recovery of healthy tissue
, less risk because of the reduction or elimination of
local anesthetics and a reduction in post-operative
recovery time, since the sutures are reduced. The types
of operations which can performed with lasers, in fact, do
not require incisions or the use of scalpels, and the laser
beam can be directed remotely using sub-millimetric
optical fibers which offer greater facility of use to the
medical personnel.

Our systems advantages
improvements for the welfare of the patients also in the
dermatological surgery sector where, if we consider, for
example, skin surgery applied to mucous, the laser has
revolutionized the traditional approach by vaporizing
rather than cutting the tissues and in this way eliminating
only the existing cutaneous lesion and saving the tissue
surrounding the lesion, all of which takes place without
bleeding due to the cauterizing effect of the laser. The
laser treatments make it possible to avoid deep cuts
in the skin and the advantage of this is represented by
the fact that no scaring of loss of elasticity in the skin
occurs; this is an important advantage, especially in the
more delicate parts of the body. In the last few years, it
has been demonstrated that laser treatments are the

most effective non-surgical and non-pharmacological
solution to prevent and to treat vaginal atrophy and its
consequences: lack of nourishment and hydration of
the cells of the vaginal mucous in fact comport dryness,
burning and discomfort and negatively influence the
relations and the self-esteem of the patients, both
when the symptoms are due to genital and urological
issues typical of natural menopause or induced after
oncological therapies as well as those due to post-partum
ipoestrogenization.

The elimination of major imperfections like hirsutism,
angiomas, acne, rosacea, psoriasis, large scars , etc.)
using our laser devices has made it possible for many
people, both on a family surrounding and in society, in
childhood as well as adulthood, to find a harmonious
balance of acceptance and dignity from other members
of the community. Besides being pathologies that are
often uncomfortable or painful, for many people living
with a part of their body, especially a highly visible one,
that is affected by apparent imperfections can also have
important psychological repercussions. Some lesions
create strong emotional reactions in the people that
are affected and create difficulty for them in personal
relations because they do not feel at ease with their own
body or suffer from depression because they are not
able to accept the imperfections and consider them an
insurmountable problem. Thanks to laser technology,
these pathologies or imperfections can be treated in
a manner that is effective, painless, non-invasive and
increasingly economical.

The improvements in the welfare of the patients are
evident also for vascular anomalies like infantile or
congenital angiomas: besides being highly visible ,
these imperfections can disturb the normal functioning
of a person or cause discomfort; the laser represents a
valid alternative to the pharmacological therapies with
respect to which it also has the advantage of preserving
the integrity of the tissues; in fact the laser treatment
