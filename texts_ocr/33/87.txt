@ ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

For the Group, the environment represents a primary asset
which must be protected. To this purpose the activities
that have been planned are aimed at finding a balance
between the economic objectives and the requirements
of the environment in order to respect and protect the
rights of future generations in line with the principles of
sustainable development. The Group is committed to the
monitoring of the environmental impact generated by

7.1 ENERGY CONSUMPTION

its activities as well as the prevention of potential risks
which may rise in this regard by implementing corrective
measures which respect the present regulations and beat
practice on this issue.

As already mentioned, the Group is committed to the
adoption of an Environmental Policy with an aim to
controlling and reducing the environmental impact of its
activities.

We create light, energy and waves. Lasers are the cleanest form of energy that

one can imagine for the environment.

The Group is committed to the reduction of its energy
consumption by taking appropriate measures like the

replacement of neon ceiling lights with LED lights and the
promotion of behaviors and habits which favor the

saving of energy and promote the development of an
environmental conscience in people.

The energy consumption of the Group consists mainly in
the use of natural gas, diesel and liquid propane gas e as
fuel for heating the offices and factories and automotive
fuel, as well as the electricity bought directly from the
network and used to heat and to cool the buildings and
for the manufacturing processes.

In particular, in 2018, the company consumed 310.832
m3 of natural gas and 5.750 liters of LPG. The total
consumption of electricity amounted to 4.270.387 kWh;
the amount of diesel fuel and gasoline used was 409.116

liters. We consumed 11.412 liters of bio-ethanol. The
overall consumption of energy therefore was 41.413 GJ. In
percentage terms most of the energy consumption can be
attributed to the use of electricity (about 37%); 35% can
be attributed to the use of company vehicles and 27% to
the consumption of natural gas for heating the buildings.
During 2018 moreover, the Group did not use sources of
renewable energy certified by guarantee of origin.

In 2018, in order to offer a better reporting of the energy
consumption of the Group, we added the data related
to the consumption of diesel fuel and gasoline for motor
vehicles, which were not available last yearâ€™. The increase
in the energy consumption is mainly due to this fact as
well as to other factors like the increase in manufacturing
activities and in the number of people employed by the
Group.

Quanta System S.p.A. installed a cogeneration plant which, in 2018, produced an
amount of electricity equal to 42% of the total consumed by the company.

7For the cars for general use we considered 70% of the overall consumption. The consumption of vehicle fuel for the cars belonging to the Italian
companies located in Calenzano and a part of those related to Lasit S.p.A., were estimated, starting from the expense, by means of the average
annual price of gasoline and diesel fuel listed on the website of the Ministry of Economic Development.
