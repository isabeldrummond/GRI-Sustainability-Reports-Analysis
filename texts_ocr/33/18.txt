Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

1.3 MATERIALITY MATRIX

The process of evaluating the relative issues was
conducted the first time in 2017 by means of an "analysis
of materiality" conducted by the top management, which
made it possible to identify the most significant aspects
in the economic, social and environmental areas for El.En
Group and for their stakeholders: these aspects in fact,
reflect the main areas of impact generated by the Group
and its activities and represents the aspects that could

potentially influence the evaluations of its stakeholders.

During 2018 the materiality matrix was updated by
carrying out the following activities:

+ interviews with the top management who were
asked to review and confirm the evaluations of the

priorities attributed to the issues in the preceding
years;

Questionnaires were submitted to some categories
of stakeholders who were asked to attribute a level
of priority to the issues they felt were the most
significant;

Analysis of the results obtained from both processes
combined with a qualitative evaluation for the
purpose of considering the best practice for the
sector and the evolution of the regulations which
brought about the up-dating of the evaluation of
each issue, as shown on the following chart:
