Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

HSE DEPARTMENT EL.EN. S.P.A.

In 2018 the Prevention and Protection Services office (SPP) of the Parent Company changed its name to Health,
Safety and Environment (HSE) Office in in order to highlight its total commitment to health and safety issues in

the workplace while increasingly referring to international control standards.

Also this year, the HSE office created special Working Instructions for the safety of the workers; these consist of a
specific procedure designed as a support for some particular aspects of our work by completely integrating the

documentation on Safety with that for Quality Control.

These instructions list the various operative tasks of all the workers as well as of those with specific qualifications
and assignments related to safety (preposts). The Working Instructions have been shared on the corporate intranet
site in a public folder created specifically for this purpose to which all employees have access. This folder contains
the most significant excerpts from the Risk Evaluation Document, the subjects of the training courses that have
been conducted in the company, the emergency plans and exits from the workrooms and other information
useful for the workers like the Digs. 81/2008.

With an aim to greater control based continual improvement The HSE office issues monthly SAFETY REPORTS
on which require inspections to evaluate the safety of the workplace and of the workers themselves following
a policy of communication and involvement for the prompt reporting of risks that are present in the company.

Improved communications have also made it possible to up-date the Risk Evaluation Document so that it easier
to understand the specific risks and to listen to the specific requests of the workers, by offering, for example
training courses in addition to those required by the Accordo Stato Regioni on December 21st 2011.

For the purpose of continual improvement in the level of safety, in the manufacturing zones we have decided to
replace the CPD laser bulkheads (Collective Protection Device) with Artificial Optical Radiation (AOR) containment
boxes which circumscribe this type of danger and expose only the specialized operators to this danger. This and

other improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of the plans presented during the periodical meetings.

At the entrance to the production zone we have also created a safety corner, i.e.,an information point for everyone
who needs access to the production area, where there are illustrated panels that show, for the various areas, the
risks they might encounter during their access and where they distribute the necessary protective devices. Along
with the safety corner we have installed turn-styles for selective access (by use of badges) which make it possible

only for authorized personnel and the authorized guests that they may be accompanying to enter.

The company has acquired two semi-automatic defibrillators and an increasing number of workers have been
trained to use them, making the company a "cardio-protected" structure that, in case of necessity, is ready to use
this precious instrument, so vital in the case of persons who are facing a critical situation.

Â°For 2018 we have decided that the reporting of the data related to injuries will be based on the new GRI standard GRI 403, published in the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI) in 2018 in replacement of the old version published in 2016. For comparison purposes, the data related to 2017 have
been revised with respect to those published in the preceding Non-financial Declaration after the up-dating of Standard GRI 403. For the data that
were published earlier, please consult the NFD for 2017 which is published on the site www.elengroup.com in the section called Investor relations/
Sustainability/Reports. The injury rate was calculated as the ratio between the total number of injuries and the total number of working hours,
using the multiplying factor of 1.000.000.
