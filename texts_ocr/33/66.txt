5.2 USES AND BENEFITS OF LASERS IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR

The laser systems that we produce for the industrial sector can be adapted for
multiple uses and can be applied to many different types of materials. The final
result that is obtained makes lasers preferable to alternative solutions because they
avoid the need for further processing and perform cutting, incisions and marking

with extreme precision.

Processing executed by a laser is particularly desirable
from a point of view of sustainability because of several
factors which make it possible to reduce the amount of
waste by instantly vaporizing the material on which they
are working and by making clean cuts without producing
chips or other processing waste. Our marking systems
also make it possible to make perforations, grey tones and
selective removal of the thickness of the material, thus
reducing waste. The use of the laser does not comport
contact between the parts and therefore avoids the risk
of deformation or accidental breaking as well as tool
wear which, consequently would produce more waste
material. Moreover, since the laser is managed digitally
by software, the movements that are made are precise
and the cuts are matched perfectly, thus reducing the
scrap that is left using traditional cutting technologies.

The reconfiguration of the processes simply using a
reprogramming of the software makes it possible to
save on accessory equipment because new dies for
each process are no longer required, nor are parts of
material that sustain the dies or the cutting instrument.
Laser processing, moreover, do not add any pollutants
and the fumes produced during the processing do not
contain chemical additives; for marking laser systems
make it possible to avoid the use of inks and solvents on
fabrics and leathers, with all of the problems inherent in
the disposal of these substances. Our laser systems are
also used for marking bar codes, serial numbers, logos
on plastic materials even a microscopic scale, to cut
objects in metacrylate and other acrylates, but also for
the processing of some labels to improve the insertion of
RFID devices which are activated by radio frequency and
are able to read information, which are used, for example,
in the field of high fashion to recognize a garment where
the label is attached which in this way becomes a unique
and "speaking" object: the use of a laser with respect to
traditional technologies in this type of processing makes
it possible to avoid the use of glues and to avoid the use of
different dies for every different label. The savings on the
dies is economical especially for the processing of small

lots, or for flexible production systems, as is increasingly
requested by the changeability of the demand and the
need to personalize the products.

Lasers are used successfully also for prevention of
counterfeiting because they can mark paper in a way
that is always original, univocal and easily up-dated: the
personalization can be changed continually to create new
holograms which make the paper three-dimensional and
make reproduction even more difficult.

In the textile sector our lasers are widely used by
companies manufacturing jeans, where the impact of
our technology has been significant. In fact, laser have
completely replaced the traditional technologies that
were used to age the denim material which were achieved
by a kind of sanding using silicon powders (which are
potentially also harmful for human health) or else using
the "stone wash" technique with chemical additives or
"sandpapering", which is very hard work for the person
who has to do it because of the use of abrasive materials
which also have a serious environmental impact since
they are harmful and difficult to dispose of.

We are proud of the fact that we have contributed to
the development and perfection of the advantages
of these processes which are much more respectful of
the environment and of social values because we are
aware of the fact that the entire industry must become
more sustainable. Through research and development
we are committed to the continuous improvement of
the performance of our systems by increasing their
effectiveness and efficiency. We produce CO, lasers that
allow a considerable saving of energy and, consequently
reduce the environmental impact by up to 25% with
respect to the sources now available on the market.
Moreover, we have developed and patented regenerating
cartridges which regenerate gas in cavities and therefore
reduce the environmental impact in terms of waste.
