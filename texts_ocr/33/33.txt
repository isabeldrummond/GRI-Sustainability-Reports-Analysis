Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

Along with the sale of systems, the company also offers
after-sales services which are an indispensable support
for the installation and maintenance of laser systems,
for the management of spare parts, consumables and
technical assistance.

Each of the two sectors is composed of various segments
which differ one from another in the specific application
of the laser system and, consequently, in the specific
underlying technology as well as the type of clientele
being served, particularly if one considers the global
presence of the company and the necessity of adapting

to the particular methods that each country has in the
uses of the technologies.

The two sectors, although they both make use of laser
technology and share numerous strategic components
and some activities at the level of production and
research and development, serve markets that are
profoundly different and their activities are organized
so as to satisfy the radically different requirements of
the various kinds of clientele that they are dealing with.
To each market corresponds a specific dynamic in the
demand and expectations for growth that are related to
different key factors.
