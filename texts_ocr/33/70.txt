Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

A PLAN FOR THE TRAINING OF UROLOGISTS IN AFRICA

In 2018 our subsidiary Quanta System S.p.A. donated a Tullio Cyber TM to the Saint Camille
Hospital in Ouagadougou, in Burkina Faso. In partnership with the SIU Foundation which
trains African urologists to operate using an endoscope which is fundamental for the
treatment of benign hyperplasy of the prostate, thanks to our laser, they created the first
clinic in the country that is able to perform minimally invasive urological operations with
Holmium and Thulium lasers.

The SIU Foundation has been involved for several years in the prevention and treatment of
urological pathologies and has often promoted non-profit initiatives aimed at improving
the welfare of the population and the training of doctors, especially in poor countries like
Burkina Faso; Quanta System had the pleasure of donating to the hospital in the main city
of the country, first a Holmium laser that can be used to pulverize stones in the urinary
tract and, this year a Thulium laser thus creating a center of excellence for the most modern
minimally invasive treatment of kidney stones and benign hyperplasy of the prostate (BHP)

thanks to a high level technology that even very few clinics in Europe possess.

The Group, moreover, is committed to sustaining cultural,
social and educational initiatives in favor of the local
community with the objective of strengthening the
relations with the surrounding area in which it operates
and with the people involved directly or indirectly in the
activities of the Group. The basic idea is the promotion
of a mutual, positive exchange between the Group and
the local community, which is beneficial to both parties
involved in the projects and activities they develop. In
particular, the companies of the Group are committee, in
different ways to:

+ donations to and sponsoring of humanitarian
organizations;

+ participation in associations for occupational training
in the sectors of pharmaceuticals, biotechnology,
and medical devices (Fondazione VITA - Istituto
Tecnico Superiore per le Nuove Tecnologie della Vita).

Moreover, the Parent Company EI.En. S.p.A. isa member of
the Association “Partners Palazzo Strozzi”, and a member
of “Assorestauro’, the Italian association for architectural,

artistic and urban restoration and has sponsored the
twelve editions of the International Conference of
LACONA (Lasers in the Conservation of Artworks) and
the six editions of the International Conference APLAR (
Laser Applications in Restoration).

In particular the Group has been active in promoting the
following activities:

+ University internships, both curricular and extra-
curricular;

+ Alternate school-work projects that involve students
from local schools and allow them to attend school
inside ofaworking situation by combining theoretical
aspects with practical ones; in begin to participate in
the workplace already starting in secondary school
in order for them to gain orientation in relation to
future employment;

+ Participation in career day events which are open-
door initiatives for a reciprocal exchange between
the companies and recent graduates looking for
their first job.
