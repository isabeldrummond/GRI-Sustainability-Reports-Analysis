Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

7.3 WATER CONSUMPTION

The efforts of the Group to respect and optimize the
environmental resources are evident also in their efficient
use of water, with the objective of keeping consumption
to a minimum and reduce waste, in a moment in which
water represents a precious resource that is at risk for
future generations.

The Group is committed to promoting correct habits
regarding the saving of water and they have given
practical advice to their employees and implemented
actions in this sense (for example, closing the tap

when the water is not being used so as to avoid the
phenomenon of "running water", etc).

Water is mainly used for washing and other sanitation
needs, for the company canteen and for production
processes. In this latter case, water is usually used in
closed circuits which means that it can be recycled and
not dispersed into the environment.

In 2018, the amount of water used was 34.043 m3 and it

came exclusively from the municipal aqueduct.
