Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

 

For the Brazilian company, the health

and safety
representatives of the workers meet once a month to
monitor the situation.

Inallofthe production companies there are representatives
that are responsible for safety and health issues (for
example, the employer, the RSPP and managers for the
Italian companies, the general manager or department
manager for the Chinese companies, the employer and
the safety manager for the German companies).

In all of the production companies there are training and
information programs regarding health and safety both

at the start of employment and later, at regular intervals.

The structure and type of training courses is defined by
the individual companies but, in general, all of them have
programs with training for generic risks as well as those
with risks connected to specific types of work, first-aid
courses and periodic up-dating courses.

In 2018 health and safety training courses at a Group level
were conducted for a total of 4.045 hours.

Considering the type of production activity that

is conducted, all of the companies have set safety
procedures and individual and collective protection
devices for the risks that are connected to artificial optical
radiation. In particular, all those involved in production
have individual protections and, in a different manner,
there are devices for individual or collective prevention
like barriers, container boxes and turn-styles to delimit
the production areas. The issue of safety is also monitored
in the non-manufacturing companies by means of the
collection and monitoring of data related to injuries.

At a Group level in 2018 they registered 29 injuries in the
workplace, which is about the same amount as last year;
in any case, considering the number of new employees
that was registered the injury rateÂ° showed a drop and
decreased from 13,2 to 11,4. The main types of injuries
were lesions and contusions, mostly to the arms and legs.
During this year so far no serious injuries or deaths have
occurred. When an injury occurs the companies conduct
an investigation to determine the cause and take new or
improved preventive measures.
