of health and safety Is managed and monitored
through a series of processes which, although they
are not centralized and coordinated at the Group
level, guarantee that in all the subsidiaries there are
procedures related to the protection of health and
safety of the workers, at the time of their training.

Risks related to the respect of human rights:
the risks are related to the respect of human rights
which might undermine a correct and responsible
management of the activities of the company. The
risk is related in particular to the activities and to
the suppliers of the Group who operate in countries
(for example, those in Asia) where the legislation
in this field is not so rigorous as it is in Italy. The
protection of human rights is explicitly mentioned
in the Ethics Code of the Group, respect of which
is required from all the companies. The Group
extends the application of its Ethics Code also to
the suppliers and explicit reference is made to the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights issued by the

 

United Nations. Moreover, the Group is committed
to adopting an Ethics Code for Suppliers, a policy
of human rights and to plan a specific training, in
particular in those countries where the legislation is
not as severe as it is in Italy.

Environmental risks: these risks are related to the
possibility of causing an environmental impact
which has negative repercussions on the local
territory in which the Group operates, or else that
inadequate measures have been taken to prevent
or reduce this impact. El.En. has always respected
environmental requirements in compliance with the
present legislation in force and in the Ethics Code of
the Group, it has repeated its commitment to protect
the environment. The Italian companies that have
adopted the Organizational Model in compliance
with D. Lgs. 231/2001 have monitored these issues
also within the Model. The Group is committed
to adopting a policy to monitor and reduce the
environmental impact of its activities.
