The relations with national and international institutions
must be conducted respecting the legislative and
administrative regulations and in the spirit of the greatest
collaboration.

For this purpose, as defined in the Ethics Code , we are
committed to:

Establishing stable channels of communication, without
any type of discrimination, with all the relative institutions
at an international, national and local level;

Representing the interests and the positions of the
companies of the Group in a way that is transparent,
rigorous and consistent and avoiding collusive attitudes;

In order to guarantee the greatest clarity in relations,

contacts with the institutional representatives must take
place exclusively through representatives who have
explicit mandate from the persons who are authorized to
do so by the companies of the Group.

Interaction with the Public Administrations, with EU
institutions, with organisms and with international
agencies must always be inspired by the principles of
legality, loyalty, correctness and transparency.

supervision, regulatory and guaranteeing activities, the
Group maintains relations of complete collaboration
