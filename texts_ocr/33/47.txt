Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

The System of Internal

Controls guarantees the

safeguarding against risks related to the pursuance
of strategic and operative objectives, reporting and
compliance, both in the Parent Company and the
subsidiaries which have adopted this approach.

Below is a list of the main risks that have been identified
that are inherent to sustainability issues:

48

Risks related to ethical behavior: the risks that are
related to a lack of integrity in the management or
the employees of the Group, which might give rise
to unethical behavior or acts that are not authorized,
illegal or fraudulent, with particular reference to
issues of active or passive corruption, corruption
of private individuals and human rights issues. To
reduce these risks for the Group we have adopted
an Ethics Code to re-enforce the dissemination of a
corporate culture that is founded on the importance
of an ethical and social responsibility in the
conducting of business and company activities; the
Parent Company and some of the Italian subsidiaries
have also adopted an Organizational Model in
compliance with D.lgs 231/2001. Moreover, the
Group is committed to adopting an anti-corruption
policy.

Risks of reputation: because of the nature of the
sectors in which the Group operates, one of the major
risks that they face at a corporate level is related to
the quality and safety of our products and the chain
of supply; any manufacturer's defects that might
occur could compromise the reliability and safety of
the final product. If we underestimate the attention
of the clients and of the community in general, we
could risk a loss of image and in our reputation,
with a consequent drop in financial performance.
The Group has always directed particular focus
on the quality and safety of the processes and the
products. The main manufacturing companies
of the Group, in fact, adopted a system for quality
control and have obtained an ISO 9001 certification,
while all of the companies that produce medical
devices have obtained the ISO 13485 certification
and operate rigorously in conformity with with the
regulations, as is demonstrated by the numerous
periodical, programmed and surprise inspections
that they have passed every year. In order to
guarantee maximum safety, moreover, as stated in
the Ethics Code, the Group establishes long-lasting
relationships with its suppliers that are based on

principles of correctness and transparency and they
monitored carefully the process for the selection of
suppliers and the maintenance of their performance,
by making specific visits to their offices in order to
verify their capacity to satisfy and maintain the
qualitative requirements needed. .We are committed
to the creation of a Code of Conduct for Suppliers
to define and share the principles, good corporate
and environmental practices and ethical behavior
and promote a supply chain that is increasingly
responsible and sustainable.

Risks related to personnel: these risks are related
to the fact that the Group does not implement
processes for the purpose of attracting, selecting,
motivating or exploiting human resources or
that there are not adequate processes intended
to guarantee the respect of diversity and equal
opportunity. In relation to the quality management
system (ISO 9001) used by the main manufacturing
companies, the issues related to the management
of the employees is protected; the Parent Company,
moreover, has codified the procedures for the
management of human resources and has profiled
the company functions with the identification of the
responsibilities and skills that are required. In all of
the companies, the training activities are defined
annually and, besides the obligatory training that
must be conducted, they register the curriculum
requirements of the company staff. The Group,
moreover, has included in the Ethics Code their own
commitment to respect and protect the dignity,
diversity and equal rights of its employees and
collaborators

Risks related to compliance with the
environmental and health and safety regulations:
these risks are connected , on one hand, to the
possibility of new regulations for the protection of the
environment and the possibility of non-conformity
with the environmental requirements stated in the
regulations and, on the other hand, the fact that the
Group does not implement processes that insure the
safety and health of the workers and the possibility
of non-conformity with respect to the laws in this
field. In the Ethics Code, the Group has codified its
commitment to the protection of the environment
and the health and safety of the workers. The Italian
companies belong to the Group have monitored
the issues related to the environment and health
and safety also in relation to Organizational Model
D.lgs 231/2001. In all of the companies, the issue
