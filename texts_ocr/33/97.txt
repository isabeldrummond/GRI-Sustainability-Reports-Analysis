"The data related to the consumption of energy in the month of December 2018, unless otherwise indicated, have been taken
from the invoices from the suppliers. The data for the energy consumption of the companies located at the headquarters in
Calenzano were estimated in part on the basis of the consumption in December of 2017. The consumption of fuel for motor
vehicles of the Italian companies in Calenzano and part of those related to  Lasit S.p.A., were estimated starting with the
expense using the average annual price of gasoline and diesel (â‚¬/L) shown on the site o the Ministry of Economic Development.

For the calculation of the energy consumption in 2018 in GJ, we have used the conversion factors of the Department for Environment,
Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), UK, 2018.
