3.2 ETHICS, INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE

The El.En. Group is aware of its responsibility towards society and the environment
in which it operates and believes that it is indispensable that ethical and
transparent behavior be followed in every aspect of the management of company
activities, both in relation to the respect of the law and the regulations as well as
the considerations of the expectations of all of the stakeholders.

For this reason starting in 2008 the Parent Company
started using its own Ethics Code as an instrument for re-
enforcing and disseminating a company culture founded
on the importance of ethic and social responsibility in
the conducting of business and company activities.

The Ethics Code defines the principles and values that
must be followed in every moment of the manufacturing
process and must be constantly observed in collegiate,
collaborative and business relations: legality, impartiality,
honesty, correctness, equity, and putting to best
advantage collaborators and the integrity of people. The
Code is applied to the Group and to all the subjects that
conduct activity in its favor.

The companies of the Group have all accepted the Ethics
Code and, where necessary it has been translated into
the local language. They have accepted the commitment
to disseminate it to their employees and collaborators
using the proper channels of communication. The Code
is always available in its up-dated version on the internet
site www.elengroup.com, in the section titled â€œInvestor
Relations/ Governance/ Corporate documents".

The rules set forth in the Ethics Code are intended to
protect the integrity of the Group and to assure their
conformity to the laws and to the regulations in each
country in which it operates. The Group is committed to
establishing the opportune channels of communication
through which they can received reports of violations
or suspected violations of the Code, or requests for
explanations. The violation of the principles defined
in the Code constitutes a breach of contract derived
from the failure to observe the contract for work and/
or collaboration and is a source for compensation of
damages.

In the contracts that have been underwritten by the
Parent Company with consultants, distributors, agents
and suppliers of critical components explicit reference
is made to the Ethics Code of the Group and the other
party must declare that they have received a copy and
that they accept it.

Moreover, the Parent Company and _ the Italian
subsidiaries, Deka M.E.LA. S.rl., Quanta System S.p.A.

and ASA S.r.l. have adopted the Organizational Model
in compliance with D.lgs 231/2001 (from now on,
"Organizational Model"), which is intended to prevent
employees and/or collaborators from committing crimes in
the interest of the company. This model for the organization,
management and control of the company activities is made
up of a series of general principles of behavior in the areas
which have been identified as sensitive, for the purposes
of preventing the so-called assumption crimes and by a
system equipped with control activities and procedures for
the prevention of these crimes.

The areas that are protected because they have been
identified as sensitive are crimes related to safety and
health on the workplace (ASA S.rl. identified only this area
as being sensitive for the planning of a special section
of its Organizational Model); crimes against the Public
Administration, corporate crimes, receiving stolen goods,
money laundering, use of money, goods or utilities of
illegal origin; moreover, ElEn. S.p.A. and Deka M.E.LA.
S.r. have identified as sensitive areas also those related to
the following crimes: market abuse, transnational crimes,
environmental crimes.

With particular reference to the risks related to ethical
behavior, the El.En Group has directed their attention to the
prevention of risks related to corruption.

In this context, the Parent Company EI.En. S.p.A. and its
subsidiaries Deka M.E.L.A. S.r.l. and Quanta System S.p.A.
have analyzed and considered relevant this risk and
they have inserted it in their Organizational Model D.lgs.
231/2001.

These companies have conducted an analysis of the
risks for the committing of cries against the public
administration (including those involving corruption)
from which. however, no particularly high level of risk
emerged, in consideration of the existence of procedures
designed to prevent it and the type of business
conducted.. Nevertheless, they have identified the
most sensitive areas and have inserted a special section
dedicated to the prevention of crimes of this type in the
Organizational Model.
