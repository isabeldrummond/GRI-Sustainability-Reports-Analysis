health and safety on the basis of the local laws. The Italian
companies of the Group have also analyzed the issue
of health and safety in relation to the Organizational
level in compliance with D.lgs 231/2001. The principle
that is followed is that the policy of safety should be
raised to a corporate level like all the other values that
characterize the strategy of the Company. Just as we

must represent an essential value which must be
protected and implemented constantly, with the help
of an organizational system which is able to identify
the instruments, the responsibilities and the direct

Organizational Model are derived, with an aim to
promote a significant reduction in workplace injuries; the
recognition that the responsibility for the management
of safety regards the entire company from the employer
to the each individual worker, on the basis of his
tasks and skills; the commitment to assign adequate
human and financial resources towards the objective
of reducing injuries and that of constantly improving
working conditions, and the promise that workers will be
adequately informed and trained in relation to the risk
connected with the processes.

On the basis of the Organizational model the

following measures are planned the identifying and
