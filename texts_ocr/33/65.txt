on the market. This is the first system in the world that
uses special microwave emissions and acts on cellulitis,
adipose tissue and loose skin, in various parts of the
body and reduces the layer of sub-cutaneous fat with a
non-invasive treatment that can be repeated even after a
short period of time and which creates immediate, visible
benefits that last over time. Besides this new technology,
many years ago the Group introduced on the market
systems for the localized removal of adipose deposits
with laser-lipolysis, a minimally-invasive technology
that makes it possible to treat specific areas of the body,
even very delicate ones where traditional liposuction is
normally not advised.

In the sector of hair removal by laser, the Group developed
and designed a system since 1990s and then continually
improved its performance; in fact, our lasers are able
to treat even very fine hairs on every type of skin, even
ones that are very dark and tan and the treatment is very
fast in order to meet the requirements of a clientele that

has increasingly less time available and the operators
who can maximize their performance thanks to the
productivity of the device.

Tattoo removal is a segment in which the Group has
recently launched innovative systems and is part of
the area of the aesthetic image that one has of oneself:
in today's society tattoos represent a language of
aggregation, i.e., belonging to a group. They contain a
message, amemory, but for many people they are part of
a past that they wish to cancel: thanks to laser technology,
the particles that contain the ink used for the tattoo are
shattered and removed through the lymphatic system
during the weeks following the treatment leaving the
tissues unaltered. It should be noted that in the eastern
hemisphere the technology that is used in the West to
remove tattoos is considered an anti-aging treatment
because it is effectively used to remove the pigmented
lesions that characterize the skin of the elderly in oriental
countries.
