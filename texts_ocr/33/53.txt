The position of the Group for hi-tech products and the
global competitive context in which it operates comports
a continuous and significant effort in terms of research
and development of new products and new technologies;
our strong point is the capacity to be single minded, to
innovate considering the requirements of the doctor and
the patient in the medical sector rather than the client in
the industrial sector, starting with every intuition which
may arise from the close and constant observation of
problems that have not yet been solved.

The skills that have been developed and the enthusiasm
of our staff are the real difference. The El.En Group and
the people who work there in fact, have a knowledge of
physical, biomedical and technological phenomena that
has matured in over thirty years of experience, which
has brought them to have an extraordinary capacity to
improve their own know-how, to innovate the production
technologies, processes products and related services.

The Group organizes its activity of research and
development according to mid- to long-term programs in
order to prepare quickly and continuously products that
are innovative in their performance and applications..

In our research activities conducted in our laboratories, as
well as that made in collaboration with important research
centers, hospitals and universities, both at a national and
international level, we set no limits since we are driven by
the desire and the passion for everything that is new or
can become new. The kind of research that is conducted
is of the applied type for most of the activities while it
is theoretical for some specific subjects, usually related
to activities regarding mid- to long-term innovative
objectives.

Theinnovating capacity of the El.En. Group is demonstrated
by the number of patents that the Group has obtained: in
less than forty years of activity since its foundation 117
patents have been obtained and 15 are pending. .
