4.3 THE SUPPLY CHAIN

In the Group there are manufacturing companies that
serve the medical and industrial sectors and marketing
companies that serve the medical market. The medical
distribute their products to qualified
distributors, directly to the end-user (medical clinics,

companies

doctors, etc) and also through OEM partners, while the
industrial companies operate on the market mainly by
selling directly to the end-users.

or it may be outsourced. Purchases of supplies are mainly
related to components and accessories for manufacturing
(technical accessories, critical components, industrial
accessories, etc).The other categories of purchases
may include office supplies, software, and computer
supplies and packaging for shipments. As far as services
are concerned, the companies of the Group use outside
suppliers for computer assistance, technical maintenance,
scientific laboratory services and certifying institutions,
companies for the disposal of special waste, for publicity
and marketing, financial services and shipping agents. We
frequently also use services that are inherent to research
and development by hiring highly qualified professionals.

During 2018 at a consolidated level the amount of spent
for purchases was 207,4 million Euros while the amount

spent for outsourcing was 7,4 million Euros.

The EI.En. Group believes that close collaboration with
the supply chain is essential in order to maintain a high
standard of quality in the finished product and, in general,
in the entire production process. The final objective is
that of establishing a long-lasting relationship that is
characterized by transparency and cooperation. The
suppliers must meet the minimum requirements for
safety, quality and financial stability in order to minimize
the risk of potential interruptions in the supply and
unexpected costs. We continually conduct preventive
analysis and evaluations in order to understand the
market trends and monitor the evolution of the present
suppliers and the potential ones, their technical up-
dating and the regulations for the sector even in relation
to the marketing of the products they sell to us.

The Group operates according to standards of fair
competition and honesty, legality and correctness
while respecting the legitimate interest of all of the
stakeholders. The Ethics Code of the Group contains
all of the principles and rules that all of those who are
in contact with the Company are required to follow. In
the contracts for the sale of critical components that
are underwritten by EI.En. S.p.A., the other party must
declare that they have received a copy of the Ethics Code
and that they accept it.
