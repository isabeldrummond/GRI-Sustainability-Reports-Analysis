5.4 OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITY

“The Group wishes to confirm its position not only as a valid point of reference for its
own shareholders and stakeholders, but also as a pillar of the community. At EI.En.
every day we are committed to making our work have a positive impact on the
health of people. Our social strategy is that of making available our skills, knowledge
and instruments with an aim to improving the access to treatment and health care
for fragile and disadvantaged people all over the world. At the same time we are
working to improve scientific knowledge. In other words, we are working for science
and for healthier world.” (Ing. Salvadeo - General Director of El.En.)

One of the ways in which we fulfill our social
responsibilities is by donations to specific non-profit
organizations, institutions and cutting-edge scientific
laboratories all over the world by assisting them in the use
of new technologies that have been placed at the service
of the health of patients as well as for the conservation
and restoration of works of art. Over the years we have
donated our systems to numerous hospitals like Careggi
Hospital and the Meyer Pediatric Hospital in Florence, the
Moshi Medical Center in Tanzania, the Pediatric Hospital
of Bambin Gest and the Gemelli Hospital in Rome and
also hospitals in Latin America.

Donations of our lasers have also been made to the
Vatican for the restoration of marble sculptures, busts,
statues and fountains as well as paintings, and to some
foreign museums like the Metropolitan in New York and

the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

Last year, the El.En. Group donated a laser to the volunteer
organization “Gli Angeli del Bello” in Florence for their
work in the removal of urban graffiti and to contribute
to the return of the beauty of the city by removing the
ugliness caused by every day acts of vandalism. In2018
we loaned, free of charge, a laser to the city of Varese to
combat the effects of degradation caused by vandalism.

During this year so far we have donated a laser to the
neuroscience sector of the Mondino Istituto Neurologico
Nazionale IRCCS. The research activities of the Mondino
Institute are focused on pathologies and issues related
to neurology and neuro-psychiatry both in adults and
children. These pathologies are quite common in the
population and are one of the causes of the high cost of
health care.
