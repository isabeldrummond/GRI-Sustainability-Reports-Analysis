Scope 2

@ Italy @ Resto of Europe @ Rest of world

To calculate the Scope 2 emissions we used different
factors based on the method of calculation and the
country. In particular:

+ For the location-based method we used average emission
factors that are related to the generation of national energy
for the different countries in which we operate as shown in
the publication titled Confronti Internazionali, Terna 2015
and 2016, respectively for 2017 and 2018;

+ For the market-based method we have used average
emission factors derived from the electricity production
of the European market for Italy, France and Germany,
which were published in the document Residual Mix

Results, Association of issuing bodies (AIB), 2016 and 2017,
respectively for 2017 and 2018. For the other countries, we
have used the same factors used for the location-based
method.

For 2018, considering the calculation method location
based for Scope 2, the total emissions were 3.564 tCO2eq:
most of them can be attributed to the consumption of
electricity (52%), while 48% is due to other factors.

For the calculation of indirect emissions using the market-
based method, ©O,., emissions were in line with those
shown above, i.e. for a total of 3.952 tons of direct and
indirect emissions of CO,..,

It should be noted that for a better compliance with Standard GRI 305-1 for the calculation of Scope 1 emissions we used an up-dated source of
the emission factors which reports the emissions in CO2eq. The Scope 2 emissions on the other hand, are expressed in tons of CO2, in any case, the
percentage of methane and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on the tota emissions of green-house gas (CO2eq), as can be seen from the technical
literature to which they refer. It should be noted that, following this improvement process of the reporting system for Scope 1 emissions and, in
particular, the up-dating , of the sources of the factors of emissions used for the calculation of the 2018 data, the data for 2017 have been revised with
respect to those shown in the preceding NFD, using new emission factors. For the previously published data, please consult the NFD for 2017, which
was published on the website www.elengroup.com. in the sction called Investor Relations/Sustainability/Reports
