Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

 

The concern for human resources is an issue of great
relevance also in the field of quality management which
most of the manufacturing companies of the Group have
adopted in conformity to regulation ISO 9001. On the
basis of this regulation, in fact, the certified companies
have been supervising certain issues like the selection,
training, and development of skilled personnel and the
definition of the responsibilities for the various functions.

The Parent Company, in particular, has conducted an
analysis for the codification of management procedures
for human resources (hiring, remuneration, etc.) as well
as the profiling of the corporate functions with the
identification of the responsibilities and skills that are
necessary. On the basis of this, we have planned ad hoc
training courses to respond to the training needs of each
one.

In the Group there are 1368 employees and together we
form an international Group that is growing and that is
called to operate in contexts that are very different on a
global level; ours is, in fact a multicultural team: of 100
people in the El.En. Group, 46 work in Italy, 38 in China, 10
in Germany and the remaining 6 are distributed among
Japan, Brazil and France.

The diversity of our people is evident in the statistics:

+ The EL.En. staff is, for the most part, young, in the
range from 30 to 50 years old (63%), with 24% of
the employees being under 30 years old, and 13%
over 50.

+ The work force is represented by 24% women, a
percentage which reaches 31% if one considers
just the white collar employees; the manufacturing
nature of the activities of the Group, in fact,
determines the prevalence of men in the category
of laborers.

We are committed to creating a working environment
that is constructive and dynamic and supports the
heterogeneity of people and talents, is stimulating
and offers opportunities for professional growth. The
management of the human resources of the Group aims
at the integration and respect of all the diversities, and
rejects any form of discrimination based on nationality,
sexual orientation, age, political or religious opinions. The

Group sustains and respects the rights of the individual
in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights issued by the United Nations, and is committed
to avoiding any form of discrimination. This commitment
also applies to all aspects of work relations including
hiring, training, job assignment, promotions, transfers
and severance.

Equally important for the creation of an inclusive work
environment are the initiatives promoted to facilitate the
balance between family life and the workplace, starting
with the possibility of working part-time.

The Group is committed to the need to create a dialog
with its employees for the purposes of reconciling the
requirements of the individual with those of the company.
This commitment is demonstrated in the management
of different categories of contracts: from national and/
or sector contracts to collective/corporate contracts and
even contracts stipulated individually.

In particular, in Italy they apply a National Collective Work
Contract (the personnel is 100% covered by collective
contract), in Germany, the workers' committee signs a
collective agreement on an annual basis (86% of the
employees are covered by collective contracts; the rest
are selling personnel who underwrite a different type of
contract); in France the apply to all of the employees the
Collective Convention IDCC nÂ°1982; in Brazil it is annually
conduct a collective negotiation, while in China and in
Japan they follow the local legislation. Moreover, in Japan
the management conducts a monthly meeting with its
employees to discuss any relevant issues. At the Group
level, it should be noted that 57% of the employees
are covered by agreements stipulated on the basis of
collective bargaining.

The period of advance notice to employees for reasons
of organizational change in the Italian companies of
the Group is regulated by the CCNL and can vary from
a minimum of 7 to a maximum of 120 days on the basis
of the CCNL that is applied, the professional category
to which they belong and their seniority; for other
companies of the Group, for example, those in China
and Japan, the national law and usual practice requires
advance notice of 30 days. For the German companies
the advance notice may vary from one to three months.
