electricity grid in 2019, the emission factors .

used came from the following sources: ISPRA
(2017) for Italy; the German UBA (2017) for
Germany; DEFRA (2019) for the United Kingdom;
Terna International Comparisons (2016) for all

published by the Centre for Resource Solutions
(“2016 Green-e Energy Residual Mix Emissions
Rates” and the relative 2019 update); for the
countries for which residual mix factors are not
available, the same emission factors applied for
the location-based approach were used;
the absenteeism rate was calculated considering
absence due to accident, illness, unpaid leave,
strikes;
working hours, where not available, were
estimated starting from an average of working
hours per employee;
the injury rate is the ratio between the total
number of accidents with absence exceeding
one working day and the total number of hours
worked, multiplied by 1,000,000.
the lost day rate is the ratio between the total
number of workdays lost and the total number of
working hours, multiplied by 1,000;
workdays lost represent calendar days lost due
