The table below compares GHG emissions in the
last two years for Scope | (direct greenhouse gas
emissions, from the consumption of natural gas,
diesel and gasoline), and Scope Il (indirect energy
emissions calculated from electricity consumption
and district heating). Scope II indirect greenhouse
gas emissions are calculated using two different
methods:

+ Location-based: reflects the average intensity
of emissions relative to the grids providing the
energy;

+ Market-based: reports emissions related to

electricity and district heating with Guarantees of

Origin that prove the energy origin.
In the absence of these guarantees, the calculation
was made with reference to the residual mix,
which entails higher emissions than the emissions

calculated with the Location-based method.

An analysis of greenhouse gas emissions trends in

the three-year period 2017-2019 shows:

+ The slight decrease in Scope | emissions (-1.6%),
due to near total offsetting of increases in
automotive fuel with decreased consumption of
gas for heating.

+ The increase in Scope Il emissions, calculated
using both the location-based (+10.5%) and
market-based (+24.2%) methods, are in keeping
with the growth of the group.

+ The emissions per employees figure is down,
however.
