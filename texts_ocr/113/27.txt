avoiding any form of discrimination of race, gender,

The Reply Group assesses the individual contribution
of all employees to corporate performance on

an ongoing basis, monitoring pre-set targets

and goals achieved, the actions put in place,

and tasks performed for a specific timespan, as

well as leveraging employee competence and
quality. During 2017, 2018 and 2019 a centralised
personnel assessment system was used to monitor

performance of the majority of employees.

When considering assessment percentages, the

significant increase in new employees joining the

company must be taken into account, who are

reviewed after their first six months at work.
