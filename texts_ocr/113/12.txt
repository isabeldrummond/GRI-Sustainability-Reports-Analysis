THE VALUE OF PEOPLE

Reply is based on the excellence of the people who
make up the company, professionals from the top
universities in the sector. These men and women
within the group bring the Reply brand to life for
customers and partners, embodying the company’s
image.

Reply invests continuously in human resources by
establishing special relationships and partnerships
with a number of universities with the aim of
attracting highly skilled individuals to join its team.
Recruitment is focused primarily on young graduates.
The particular disciplines of interest include
computer science, computer engineering, electronic
engineering, telecommunications engineering,
management engineering, and economics and
business. The relationship between Reply and
universities is also developed through regular
collaboration, such as industrial placements,
dissertations, and participation in lectures and
seminars.

The values that characterise Reply’s employees are
enthusiasm, excellence, a methodical approach,
team spirit, initiative and an ability to understand
the business context and to communicate clearly
the solutions proposed. The continuous desire to
imagine, experiment with and research new solutions
allows innovation to come about more rapidly and
efficiently.

Those who decide to become a part of the “Reply
world” will have the opportunity to fully express
their potential within an organisational model based
on culture, ethics, trust, honesty and transparency.
These values are vital for the process of continual

improvement and for enabling employees to focus
ever more sharply on the quality of their work.

All of the group’s managers endeavour in their daily
work to uphold the principles on which Reply has
always depended and that have sustained it during

its growth.
