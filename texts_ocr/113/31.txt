FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL

THEMES

As specified in the Code of Ethics, the Reply Group is
committed to managing its business activities paying
close attention to environmental issues, contributing to
diffusion of sustainability culture to respect the legacy
for future generations. Reply works mainly in offices
and most of the services are delivered by employees
directly at client premises. Consequently, environmental
impact is limited to consumption of energy resources
(for office heating and lighting) and the ensuing impact
on climate change.

In most cases the Group does not own the premises
out of which it operates and cannot implement energy
efficiency measures itself, but it has put in place
environmental policy guidelines to reduce and monitor
the impact of corporate activities on the environment,
including aspects related to energy consumption and
green-house gas emissions. The guidelines enable
evaluation of the external and internal context in

which the Group operates, with particular reference to
policies implemented by the European Union and other
international organisations (i.e. GHG Protocol, Carbon
Disclosure Project), identifying the main environmental
impact areas and relative tools for addressing the

issues.
These include:
+ the GHG Emissions Control Program, inspired by

the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), and applied

to monitor impact in terms of GHG emissions,

implement measures to decrease GHG emissions,

and to meet stakeholder expectations;

+ the Environmental Monitoring System, with
which the Reply Public Sector Consortium and its
Italian consortiums gained and maintained ISO

14001:2015 certification, is aimed at minimising
negative environmental impact, to guarantee
regulatory compliance and promote continuous
environmental performance improvement.

The main guidelines defined by the policy are
intended for all employees and cover the following:
document printing, materials recycling, energy
saving, energy efficiency, transport, and consumption
reporting. For each aspect, a number of rules of
conduct are outlined as the underpinning to daily
choices, both for the individual and at corporate
level: use of public transport, preferring devices
with high energy efficiency, decreasing document
printing, complying with separate waste collection
requirements in offices. Environmental policy also
identifies the roles, responsibilities, tools and
activities to be implemented for monitoring impact,
raising environmental awareness, communication,
and reporting.

The Group’s activity to raise awareness of
environmental issues affects the fabric of society
outside of Reply, including “Student Clash” initiatives,
which are events that aim to develop new ideas in
collaboration with universities.

In 2019, the theme of Student Clash events was the
Green Internet of Things (loT), with Precision Farming
and Energy & Utilities as specific contexts. This
involved around 500 students from the Turin and
Milan Polytechnics who set about generating 125

business ideas.
