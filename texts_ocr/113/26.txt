In addition to the in-house workforce, there are
independent contractors and interns engaged in
training courses and/or professional placement paths
in Group companies. In 2019, contractors increased
by 14% compared to 2018, already increased by

13% compared to 2017. Independent contractors

deal mainly with software development and ICT
systems support. All of the staff employed in Italy and
Brazil have signed collective bargain agreements,
although this is not the case in other countries where
Reply operates, since it is not envisaged by local
legislation.

The management and optimisation of Reply’s human
capital is achieved through integration and respect
of equal opportunities and diversities, representing
essential assets for idea and process innovation, and
for addressing and managing market challenges in
the best way.
