Reply is collaborating with leading OEMs to produce
commercial versions of V2 platforms (Vehicle to
Infrastructure). There have been developments in
on-board (infotainment and telematics box) as well
as mobile and back-end software applications to
process data received and deliver B2C and B2B

services.

There was another leap forward in electric and
hybrid vehicle development. The charging process
for this transport category needs to be optimised
in terms of both speed and logistics. To this end,
Reply drew on the firm foundation of its mobile and
cloud platform development experience to design
connected vehicle service platforms together with
business customers. These can supplement data
from on-board systems with data on the internet

in order to calculate the best routes between the
various charging stations. Reply has also worked
with the leading European shared mobility operator

to create a vehicle—infrastructure communication

control unit, developing both hardware and software.

Finally, 2019 saw Reply confirm its leadership in
the sector of logistics IT solutions to support the
automotive industry. Projects involved leading OEMs
and the whole supply chain, from production to

factory logistics, aftersales distribution and transport.

RETAIL

The retail sector has already been profoundly
altered by developments in customers’ purchasing
behaviour, new players in the market, e-commerce,
and radical digitalisation of products and services.

The customer experience too has changed form

in this new situation and has become a factor in
differentiating retailers: today’s customers want an
ever-closer relationship with brands and expect

to be able to interact with them wherever they

are, breaking down the barrier between physical
stores and e-commerce. A completely personalised
purchasing experience is essential to generating a
positive perception of interaction with companies
and brands. This makes it essential to base
strategies on data, including real-time analysis of
customer behaviour and seamless integration of the
digital and physical world.

Reply also supports traditional retailers in adding
digital functionality to their business, incorporating
the very latest technology in their work and daily
interaction with customers. In 2019, it collaborated
with a large number of European retailers to
introduce voice assistants and solutions based on
augmented and virtual reality to revolutionise the
shopping experience, eliminating the divide between

digital and in-store.

ENERGY & UTILITY

Increasingly advanced digital technologies are
having a major impact in energy and utility services
throughout the chain. Digitalisation is now affecting
all phases, from generation to sales and consumption
monitoring. 2019 confirmed a trend of growth in
innovative technologies on an industrial scale, across
the entire value chain. These technologies can also

support sustainability policies, a key theme for 2020.
