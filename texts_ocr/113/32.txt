Energy consumption

The Reply Group energy consumption refers to:

+ Electricity, sourced from the national grid to
supply offices and premises lighting systems,
and technological and IT equipment (computers,
printers, servers, data centres).

+ Natural gas for the operation of the heating
systems installed in the Reply offices and whose
consumption is strictly linked to the volume of
corporate activities and number of offices.

+ Diesel and gasoline fuel for corporate vehicles.

+ Diesel used for heating.

+ District heating for offices and/or producing hot
water, with a reduction in environmental impact.
District heating is used mainly in Italy, Poland,

Belarus, England, Luxembourg and Germany.

TABLE 2. ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY TYPE

The table below shows energy consumption by type
for 2017, 2018 and 2019.

The data reported show an increase in electricity

(+ 33,8%) and diesel for running vehicles (+ 22,9%)
consumption over the three-year period, mainly due
to the growth of the organisation in terms of activities
managed, the increase in the workforce, expansion
of premises and offices, as well as the acquisition

of new companies during 2019. Conversely, there
was a decrease in the consumption of natural gas
(-27,8%) and district heating energy (-19.1%) thanks

to enhanced efficiency in building heating systems
management with a reduction in the number of hours
boilers were in use and in office opening hours, as
well as continuous improvement in data collection
methods. Heating figures are also affected by climate
change, the effects of which overlap with initiatives to

boost efficiency.

 

 

 

 

 

 

TYPE OF CONSUMPTION UNIT OF MEASURE 2017 2018 2019
Electricity kWh/ year 9,571,010 10,259,103 12,820,844
Natural gas m?/ year 1,417,462 982,642 1,022,743
Diesel (vehicles) ltrs/ year 1,630,992 1,913,664 2,005,255
Diesel (heating) ltrs/ year - - 17,000

District heating kWh/ year 3,678,126 2,937,108 2,976,796

 

The energy consumption figures demonstrate Reply’s commitment to protecting the environment and limiting

greenhouse gas emissions, with a reduction in both consumption and emissions for both Scopes.

With respect to Scope 2 consumption (district heating and electricity) the kWh consumption per employee

dropped by 2.6%, with an average consumption of 1,846 kWh against last year’s figure of 1,896 kWh.
