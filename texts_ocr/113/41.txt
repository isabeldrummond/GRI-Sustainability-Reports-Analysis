In particular, the following results can be noted:

+ the most relevant topics both for stakeholders
and the company are “Skills development” and
“Attraction and retention of talent’, in line with
he industry in which Reply operates and with the
importance that know-how and human capital
have for business;

+ “Business ethics and integrity” and “Data and
Privacy Protection” are two of the most relevant
or Reply, above all by virtue of its business and
he importance these issues have for its long-term

success;

 

+ topics related to “Energy consumption and
climate change” and “Diversity and equal
opportunities”, on the other hand, assume
importance for stakeholders and reflect the

growing impact that these issues assume globally.

With respect to the materiality matrix indicated in
the previous edition of the document, note that

the relevance of the “Health and Safety” topic has
changed from medium to high.

Note also that the topic of water management is
not in that section, despite being envisaged by Leg.
Decree 254/2016, since the Group has deemed it to
be of low relevance given its specific characteristics
and those of its business. Group water consumption
refers solely to the use of water for hygiene and
sanitation at the various offices of Group companies
as well as their use in terms of technology, such

as air-conditioning and fire protection systems.
Given the volumes of water used, type of use and
geographical location of our offices, the impact on
water resources was deemed negligible.

Regarding Human Rights, envisaged by Art. 3 of

Leg. Decree 254/2016, it should be noted that they
are already included in other topics and there are
no relevant related risks; it should also be noted that
Reply operates in accordance with a Group Code
of Ethics, as described in the “Corporate values
and ethical principles” chapter, directed towards
the recognition of and respect for the physical and
moral integrity, personal dignity, private sphere and
personal rights of every individual.

Reply guarantees and promotes diversity and
gender equality, not tolerating discrimination of
any kind based on people's age, racial and ethnic
origin, nationality, political opinions, religious
beliefs, sex, sexuality or state of health or that

can be attributed to bullying or conduct that may
offend personal sensibilities. Reply distributes and
requests acceptance of its Code of Ethics from all
Group employees and collaborators (also pursuant
to specific contractual clauses). In light of these
safeguards, no significant risks have been detected
in the area of Human Rights.

Please refer to the Code of Ethics published on
the company website, www.reply.com, for further
information.
