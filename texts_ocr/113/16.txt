HUMAN RIGHTS

To deliver its services, the Reply Group may engage
independent contractors for its in-house teams. Failure
to implement a process during selection for assessing
the ethical practices of such contractors, including
legal compliance, human rights, corruption, and social
responsibility might expose the Group to long-term
negative effects.

 

In conducting its business, the Reply Group is
committed to supporting human rights protection and
avoiding any form of discrimination. Nonetheless,
absence of corporate policy to prevent or manage any
discrimination might increase the likelihood of such
incidents arising.

Reply requires independent
contractors to accept its Code of
Ethics explicitly.

The Group has in place
administrative processes to
guarantee stringent checks on
independent contractors.

Reply has in place a whistleblowing
system that employees can use

to flag any irregular conduct or
violations of applicable regulations
and internal procedures.
