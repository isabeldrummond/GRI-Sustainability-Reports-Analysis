procedures based on OHSAS
Standard 18001. Several Group
companies have approved specific
health and safety policies, if required
by legislation or market practices.

 

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS

In most cases, the Reply Group does not own the
premises that house its offices. This situation means
the company is unable to put in place direct energy
efficiency measures that might bring financial benefits
or improve environmental performance.

Moreover, the absence of an emissions management
program might bring a risk of damage to the Group’s
reputation, especially if it is required to report
environmental performance.

The Reply Group has defined and
communicated its Environmental
Policy.

Reply is engaged in the Carbon
Disclosure Project (CDP) for its
Supply Chain.

 

 

In conducting its business, the Reply Group produces
waste, including special waste (e.g. WEEE), whose
disposal is covered by specific legal requirements.
Failure to implement a program for monitoring waste
disposal methods, may mean the Group is non-
compliant with current legislation.

 

Reply’s electrical and electronic
waste is entrusted to external
authorised companies for correct
disposal.

Reply recycles any unused
functioning computers and donates
them to schools located near its
main Italian offices.
