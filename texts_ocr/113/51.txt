5. understanding of the processes underlying the preparation, collection and management of the
significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the NFS. In particular, we held
meetings and interviews with the management of Reply SpA and we performed limited
analysis of documentary evidence, to gather information about the processes and procedures
for the collection, consolidation, processing and submission of the non-financial information
to the function responsible for the preparation of the NFS.

Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group:
- at Group level,

a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the NFS, and in particular
to the business model, the policies adopted and the main risks, we carried out
interviews and acquired supporting documentation to verify their consistency with
available evidence;

b) with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical procedures as
well as limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the accuracy of
consolidation of the information;

- for Reply SpA and the Italian subsidiaries of the Group, which were selected on the basis
of its activities, its contribution to the performance indicators at a consolidated level and
its location, we carried out site visits during which we met local management and
gathered supporting documentation regarding the correct application of the procedures
and calculation methods used for the key performance indicators.

Conclusions

Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS
of Reply Group as of 31 December 2019 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance
with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and with the GRI Standards, as disclosed in the paragraph
“Methodology” of the NFD.
