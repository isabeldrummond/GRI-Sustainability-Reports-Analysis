Reply has adopted the Global GDPR Compliance
Program, allowing the Group to update its
organisational model with respect to privacy and
fulfilling the regulatory requirements of the new EU
Regulation 2016/679 GDPR (General Data Protection
Regulation), which came into effect on 25 May

2018. This program also put in place to standardise

data and privacy protection practices for all Group

companies and holdings, was applied through the
definition of a Privacy Management system which
envisaged the following actions:

+ Preparation and regular updating of GDPR
Registers (inventory of actions by the company
and its holdings involving personal data);

+ Privacy by Design Process, which involves,
the implementation of privacy risk assessment
practices that identify technical and organisational
measures to ensure that each new project or
significant change meets GDPR privacy and
security requirements;

+ Data Breach notification process, which provides
for the management and any notification of a data
breach to the personal data protection authority,
and, if necessary, to individuals impacted by the
data breach;

+ Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
process, which allows the identification and
mitigation of privacy risks for the treatment of
data that are most at risk, for example, conducted
on special data, and large-scale profiling and
monitoring activities;

+ Privacy Request handling process, namely
management of the requests of interested parties

regarding application of their personal data

rights (for example, portability, data access and
cancellation, etc.).

In addition, the Group has defined a policy to be
followed to verify that privacy legislation (Data
Processing Agreement) is respected during the
negotiation phase with the customer, and during
the service delivery phase, providing operational
instructions for Group employees, who must accept

and apply the policy to guarantee Reply compliance.

As part of the reporting of incidents related to data
loss, an “ICT security incident management” policy
is in place, regarding the definition of incident
management methods that can compromise

one or more information security requirements
(confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data) with
the potential violation of applicable legislation (for
example, the GDPR). The procedure describes the
three phases defined by the incident management
process (identification/classification, response, and
“lessons learned”) and the roles and responsibilities

for the different phases identified.

In addition, the Group has put in place a data
protection and privacy e-learning training
programme for all its employees, as well as a
classroom course for partners. These courses are in
addition to established awareness raising activities

for employees such as the “Awareness” course (for

executives), IT security, and the “Simulated Phishing”

initiative, aimed at increasing worker awareness of
data protection risks.
