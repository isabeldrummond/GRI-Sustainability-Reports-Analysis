MARKET FOCUS

In every market segment where it operates, Reply
combines specific sector expertise with broad
experience in the provision of services and a wealth
of technological capabilities.

TELCO & MEDIA

Convergence between the physical and the virtual
means that the types of relationships telco and
media companies have with their customers are
changing drastically. In this increasingly competitive,
hybrid context, operators are meeting with new
challenges that require innovative, made-to-measure
offerings, new business models and new operating
processes in response. Telco companies can play

a leading role in the digital ecosystem, becoming
multimedia platforms that can also dialogue with third
parties, thereby addressing consumers more directly
and offering services more closely connected to their

needs.

In this context of profound change, Reply works
with the major players in the sector to define and
implement digital transformation strategies that
draw on big data and employ artificial intelligence
and machine learning systems to enable the
design of services ever more suited and targeted
towards customer requirements. Thanks to in-
depth knowledge of the sector and its operational
dynamics, Reply can not only act to optimise its
processes but also to automate them, exploiting

specific Robotic Process Automation solutions.

But customer relationships and a focus on the
service delivered aren't the only aspects of telco to
be affected by digital change. The growing presence
of connected objects also demands reconfiguration
of the networks to enable huge volumes of data to
be transported in real time. This data is no longer
solely generated by smartphones and other mobile
devices, but by a multitude of connected objects.
Reply is playing an active part in this new era of
“smart connection”, in which the network itself needs
to adapt and reconfigure to meet users’ constantly
changing needs. That’s why it has defined an
integrated strategic and technological consulting
offering to support development in connection with
5G and the design, definition and management

 

of the new-generation networks based on SDN
technologies, capable of integrating and managing
virtual networks through network engineering and

network operations services.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

Digital transformation is having a radical effect on
financial institutions. Leading market analysts expect
the financial digital platform market to explode in

the years to come, both because of the greater
number of digital natives among retail customers and
because of a technological evolution in the direction
of highly scalable cloud platforms.

The increasing penetration of solutions based
on artificial intelligence and robotics is another
powerful factor in transformation, made possible
by the explosion in the amount of data available
(big data), by increasing digitalisation of services
