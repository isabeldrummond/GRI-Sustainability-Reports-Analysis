Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control

We are independent in accordance with the principles of ethics and independence set out in the Code
of Ethics for Professional Accountants published by the International Ethics Standards Board for
Accountants, which are based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, competence and
professional diligence, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our audit firm adopts International
Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italy 1) and, accordingly, maintains an overall quality control
system which includes processes and procedures for compliance with ethical and professional
principles and with applicable laws and regulations.

Auditor’s responsibilities

Weare responsible for expressing a conclusion, on the basis of the work performed, regarding the
compliance of the NES with the Decree, with the GRI Standards and, limited to some indicators, with
the G4 Sector Disclosure. We conducted our engagement in accordance with “International Standard
on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) — Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or
Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (hereafter “ISAE 3000 Revised”), issued by the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements.
The standard requires that we plan and apply procedures in order to obtain limited assurance that the
NES is free of material misstatement. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement
are less in scope than those performed in a reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE
3000 Revised (“reasonable assurance engagement”) and, therefore, do not provide us with a
sufficient level of assurance that we have become aware of all significant facts and circumstances that
might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.

The procedures performed on the NFS were based on our professional judgement and consisted in
interviews, primarily with company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information
presented in the NFS, analysis of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to obtain
evidence considered useful.

In particular, we performed the following procedures:

1. analysis of the relevant matters reported in the NFS relating to the activities and
characteristics of the Group, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process
used, in accordance with article 3 of the Decree and with the reporting standards adopted;

2. analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area, in order to
assess their compliance with the Decree;

3. comparison of the financial information reported in the NFS with that reported in Reply
Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements;
4. understanding of the following matters:

— business and organisational model of the Group, with reference to the management of the
matters specified by article 3 of the Decree;

- policies adopted by the Group with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the
Decree, actual results and related key performance indicators;

- main risks, generated and/or faced by the Group, with reference to the matters specified
in article 3 of the Decree.

With reference to those matters, we compared the information obtained with the information
presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described under point 5 a) below;
