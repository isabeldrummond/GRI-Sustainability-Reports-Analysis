CORPORATE VALUES AND
ETHICAL PRINCIPLES

REPLY’S CODE OF ETHICS

In ensuring that all their corporate activities

are based on principles of proper conduct and
transparency, Reply and its subsidiaries adopt

a Code of Ethics approved on 28 March 2008,
distributed and circulated in all the countries where
the Group operates. This code was developed to
ensure that the Reply Group’s key ethical values
are clearly defined and constitute the basic element
of corporate culture, as well as set a standard of
conduct for all those working for the Group with
regard to business and non-business affairs. The
document is intended for all Group stakeholders,
namely: shareholders, employees, independent
contractors, suppliers, customers, and business
partners. The fundamental ethical principles

of the Group are: worker professionalism and
reliability; legality and honesty of Group activities
in compliance with current legislation; impartiality,
which carries with it respect for diversity and

no discrimination among workers; and integrity,
prevention of potential conflicts of interest, as well
as transparency regarding all business practices
involving the recipients of the Code. Furthermore,
the Code of Ethics defines the rules of conduct that

define Reply’s relationship with its stakeholders.

The relationship with its employees is developed
through specialisation of skills, attention to quality
and cooperation for achieving objectives, and

constant assessment of the contribution made by
each resource to company results. All the Group’s

independent contractors and consultants are

required to comply with the law and with the
obligations defined in their respective contracts
and in the Code of Ethics, working diligently to
safeguard corporate assets. The Reply Group is
committed to achieving maximum results to protect
workplace health and safety for employees, and
operates respecting local and national communities,
contributing to the circulation and awareness of
sustainable development.

Furthermore, the Group’s Code of Ethics describes
the relationship with public authorities and
institutions, delegated to those who are formally
appointed within the individual companies and have
explicit mandate. Relationships with institutions are
based on legality, transparency, clarity, and integrity,
in full compliance with current applicable legislation.
Relationships with customers are founded on
shared objectives, in the spirit of professionalism,
responsibility, and integrity. Group workers shall
therefore aim to maintain and develop existing
relationships to the highest quality standards, to
satisfy the customer’s reasonable expectations,
which will be monitored on a regular basis. The
selection of suppliers and stipulation of terms and
conditions applicable to purchase of goods and
services for Group companies shall be dictated

by the values and criteria of legality, competition,
objectivity, integrity, impartiality, fair price, quality

of goods and/or services, with a careful evaluation
of product warranty and range of offers. Security
of information systems is one of the requirements
specified as fundamental in Reply’s Code of Ethics.
IT security is guaranteed by implementing the

necessary procedures and technical mechanisms
