THE REPORTING PROCESS

The contents of this Consolidated Disclosure of
Non-Financial Information result from a drafting,
validation and approval process in compliance with
the “Disclosure of Non-Financial Information Drafting
Procedure” that the Group adopted in January 2018.
Specifically, the procedure regulated the
responsibility of the various parties in the process:
the CFO, Internal Audit, Data Owners and
Operational Representatives.

The CFO, with the support of Internal Audit and
according to the methods outlined in the “Materiality
Analysis” paragraph, identifies the relevant financial
aspects which are therefore subject to reporting
according to the business, its progress and the
impact that it has.

The CFO selects the non-financial information and
indicators subject to reporting from those proposed
by the GRI Standards on the basis of the results from
the materiality analysis.

The non-financial data collection process is as
follows: the Internal Audit department prepares and
sends the Data Owners the data collection forms

for the topics in each of their areas of competence;
the Data Owners in turn request that the operational
representatives complete the forms in accordance
with the deadlines contained in the business plan;
once the contents are approved, they are sent to the
Internal Audit department, which collects, analyses
and consolidates them.

The Internal Audit department then prepares the
draft of the Disclosure of Non-Financial Information
and sends it to the Data Owners for their final
validation, each for their own area of competence.
The validated draft is then submitted first of all

to the CFO for their approval and then the Board

of Directors of Reply S.p.A., which approves its
definitive version.

This Disclosure is published together with the
Annual Report for the Reply Group, in the “Corporate
Governance — Consolidated Disclosure of Non-

Financial Information” on the www.reply.com website.
