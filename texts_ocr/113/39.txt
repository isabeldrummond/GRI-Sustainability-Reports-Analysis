MATERIALITY ANALYSIS

With the aim of identifying topics that are significant
from a sustainability perspective in the medium-long
term, in 2018 the Group carried out its first materiality
analysis as required by GRI Standards.

This analysis comprised two distinct phases:

1) identification of the set of topics, aimed at
identifying potentially relevant non-financial aspects
with reference to the five areas of Decree Law
254/2016 (environment, personnel, human rights,

social, anti-corruption and bribery);

2) identification of material topics for Reply following
the analysis of relevance for stakeholders (external

relevance) and for the company (internal relevance).

+ In particular, the set of potentially significant non-
financial aspects has been defined through:

* an analysis of sustainability trends at global
level: mapping of the main non-financial aspects
taken into consideration by the main stock
exchanges that have published sustainability
reporting guidelines, sustainability ratings (DJSI,
MSCI, etc.), international organisations (GRI, World
Economic Forum, etc.), and governments (EU
policies, UN reports, etc.);

* an analysis of industry pressures: mapping of
non-financial aspects highlighted as relevant
for the Information Technology industry, taking
into consideration publications by international
organisations (Robecosam, SASB, etc.);

+ —anindustry benchmark: analysis of sustainability
reports published by the Group’s main
competitors.

The next phase focused on prioritising the universe
of non-financial aspects in order to identify the
material topics for the company and its stakeholders
on which reporting was to focus.

The significance of each non-financial aspect for
Reply was assessed through workshops for top
corporate management, sorting topics based on
their relevance to the Group. The importance of each
topic for the company, as well as the perception
of the individuals involved, was also based on the
evaluation of:

* commitment and policies adopted by Reply with
respect to each topic;

+ impact of each topic on the company’s ability to
pursue its objectives and create value over the
long term;

+ potential risks and/or opportunities that each

topic potentially represents for the Group.

To define external relevance for Group stakeholders,
the results of the analyses conducted to identify

the universe of topics were considered, being
representative of the opinions of the Group’s main

stakeholders.

In agreement with GRI Standards in prioritising

non- financial aspects, the relevance of the impact
of each was considered, both within the reporting
boundaries and externally, namely along the Reply
value creation chain.

Finally, Reply’s non-financial material topics were
identified by intersecting the relevance of the topics

for the Group with those for stakeholders.
