FOREWORD

Directive 2014/95/EU (hereinafter also “Directive”)
of the European Parliament and the Council,
regarding the disclosure of non-financial and
diversity information by certain large undertakings
and groups, entered into force on 6 December 2014.
The Directive demonstrates the commitment of the
EU legislator to contribute to a transition towards a
global sustainable economy, which combines long-
term profitability, social justice and environmental
protection, promoting the valuing of companies that
implement transparent management policies aimed
at obtaining better performances also in the non-
financial area.

In the Italian legislation, the Directive was enacted as
Legislative Decree No. 254 of 30 December 2016
(hereinafter the “Decree”), which requires large-scale
public interest entities to publish a Consolidated
Disclosure of Non-Financial Information (NF),
covering (to the extent necessary for comprehension
of corporate activities, performance, results, and
impact it produces) information relating to five
fundamental areas, namely: environment, personnel,
human rights, social, anti-corruption and bribery. The
Decree, with reference to these areas, requires the

description of the main risks, generated and suffered,

of the policies practised by the company, the related
performance indicators and the management

and organisation model (Leg. Decree 254/16 and
subsequent amendments, Art. 3 c. 1). The Reply
Group (hereinafter also the “Group” or “Reply”), as

a public interest large undertaking, is subject to the
aforementioned Decree for the 2019 reporting year.
This NFI was prepared to fulfil the requirements

of the aforementioned Decree regarding the non-
financial information disclosure.
