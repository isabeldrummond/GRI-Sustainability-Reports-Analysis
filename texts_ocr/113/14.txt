Leg. Decree

254 area Risk description

 

Reply’s operational and managerial
structure is able to ensure continuity
in corporate governance.

Group success depends largely on several key

figures that have made a decisive contribution to

its development, for instance the Chairman and

Executive Directors of the Reply S.p.A. parent company.

Moreover, Reply has a leadership team with many years

of experience in the sector and playing a crucial role

in the management of Group business. The loss of any

of these key figures and failure to find an adequate

substitute or to attract and retain new, qualified

personnel could therefore have adverse effects on

the Group’s business prospects, earnings and financial
EMPLOYEE position.
MATTERS

 

Reply works on a regular basis with
many universities and research cen-
tres, both in Italy and abroad, with
projects such as ReplyU social me-
dia profiles, Reply Challenges on-
line initiatives and university events
such as Student Tech Clashes.
Furthermore, Reply has imple-
mented a platform for document
archiving and for sharing insights,
links, opinions, and documentation,
to encourage employees to keep
abreast of the most recent develop-
ments in the ICT sector.

The Group operates in the ICT service segment,
which is characterised by fast, important technological
developments and constant evolution of professional
skills and expertise. Thus, Reply business relies on its
ability to attract and retain new, well-qualified human
resources, as well as being able to foresee adequate
training programs to provide workers with the tools
they need to develop innovative solutions. The
inability to attract resources and prepare such training
programs could have a negative impact on the Group’s
future prospects.
