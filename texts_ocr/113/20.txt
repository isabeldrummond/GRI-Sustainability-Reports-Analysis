to ensure the reliability of processed information,
as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of the

services rendered by the Group.

In conducting its business, the Reply Group focuses
mainly on principles based on transparency and
integrity, respecting the expectations of the various
stakeholders and regulatory provisions. In this
regard, the most important aspects for the Group,
considering its business, relate to regulatory
compliance, protection of customer data, and

responsible management of workers.

COMPLIANCE AND THE FIGHT AGAINST
CORRUPTION

To maintain its business relationships with private
and public entities, the Reply Group considers
compliance with current legislation to be essential,

also with reference to un

anti-corruption and bribery.

air competitive practices,

In Italy, Reply has adopted an Organisation,

Management and Contro

Model in accordance with

Legislative Decree 231/2001. This is a structured

overall system of control

procedures and processes

aimed at preventing any non-compliant behaviour,

including corruption, whenever possible. Group

employees are required

‘0 comply with the MOGC

231 and related procedures, which specify operative

models for conducting various business processes.

 

These procedures have been adopted to reinforce
the internal control system, specifically those related
to corporate corruption and crimes. To verify the
effective application of these procedures, internal
audits are performed on a regular basis. Moreover,
in each country where the Group operates, specific

20

channels are currently in place to report episodes of
corruption.

MOGC 231 specifies processes at risk of corruption
and they include management of entertainment
expenses, gifts, sponsorships, and generic
donations.

For this reason, the Group has formalised a “Policy of
Gifts, Entertainment Expenses, Sponsorships”, valid
for each of the Group companies and containing
guidelines to be applied so as to avoid conduct

that will fail to comply with legislative provisions and
internal rules of conduct.

There is a formal Whistleblowing Policy, again at
Group level, encouraging employees to report any
suspected wrongdoing as soon as possible and
reassuring that any such report will not affect their
working conditions.

The term “wrongdoing” refers to non-compliance
with applicable legislation, violations of the Code of
Ethics and/or Group Policy, and, more generally, to
actions that may damage (for example in economic,
environmental, workplace safety terms) the Reply
Group companies and stakeholders.

The policy describes the ways in which employees
are required to report such events, namely by
reporting to the Supervisory Body, which guarantees
the confidentiality of reports, as well as the
informant’s anonymity (in accordance with Legislative
Decree 196/03 — EU Regulation 679/2016, of the
General Data Protection Regulation).

The Supervisory Body is tasked with verifying the
reports and relaying them to the Reply S.p.A. Board,
which then will decide whether to implement an
intervention plan.
