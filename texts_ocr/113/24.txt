The Reply Group has formalised the process to

be followed in the event of re-use or disposal of

hardware containing data processed by the Group.

In particular, the purpose of this procedure is to

prevent any possible unauthorised access, use and

disclosure of data contained in hardware reused,

resold, returned in the case of leasing, discarded,

or more generally used for different purposes or by

different owners.

The process describes:

+ methods for reuse or disposal of hardware;

* secure removal methods for each type of
hardware;

+ methods for demagnetisation and physical
destruction of hardware;

+ supplier selection criteria with respect to
hardware destruction and disposal.

Indicators

During 2019, as in previous years, there were no
registered complaints regarding privacy violations or
customer data loss.

MANAGEMENT OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS
The selection process and the focus on building
virtuous, long-lasting relationships with independent
contractors is essential to the Group. Independent
contractors work both at Reply and customer
premises, so they are assessed and managed
carefully. To this end, a structured selection,
assessment and qualification process of independent
contractors is in place, centrally managed by

the Sourcing division, which monitors level of
performance and encourages ongoing development.
The social criteria used to evaluate independent

contractors are country specific. In Italy, fulfilment
of social security obligations and compliance with
employment status of independent contractors is
checked.

In the United Kingdom, the Modern Slavery Policy
was enacted, as required by local legislation.

In Germany, given the nature of independent
contractors, who are largely individual freelancers, no
such assessment process was followed.

All contracts signed by the Group require that
independent contractors and suppliers accept and

apply the Group’s Code of Ethics.

Indicators

The percentage of new suppliers that were screened
using social criteria in 2019 was 65.2% compared to
79.5% in 2018, and 42.0% in 2017.

As already indicated, this type of checking is not
carried out in Germany, since the work is performed
by individual freelancers. Without taking Germany
into consideration, there is an 89% evaluation figure
for Region 1 and 83% for Region 3.
