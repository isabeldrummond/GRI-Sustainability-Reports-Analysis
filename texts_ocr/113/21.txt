An Anti-Bribery Policy was issued in the United
Kingdom and other Region 3’ countries in 2019 in
keeping with the provisions of the 2010 Bribery Act,
which lays down penalties for the crime of corruption

in both the public and private sectors.

Indicators

In 2019, as in the previous years, no episodes of
corruption were registered in any of the Group’s
companies, nor were legal proceedings initiated for
reasons linked to corruption, unfair competition or
monopoly practices. Moreover, no monetary or non-
monetary sanctions were received for violation of
any socio-economic laws or regulations.

In Italy, employees are notified of the 231 Model upon
entry; it must be accepted explicitly, and a test must
be passed. In 2019 the acceptance figure was 95%
of employees: in detail, 92% of executives and 95%

of managers and staff employees.

In Region 3, notification of the anti-bribery policy
began in 2019, with explicit acceptance by 68% of
employees: in detail, 90% of executives, 92% of
managers and 63% of staff employees. It should be
noted that this acceptance procedure has not yet
been applied to all companies in the Region.

As of 31 December 2019, 100% of Region 2
employees signed the Code of Ethics. In Region

1, the percentage was 95%, while in Region 3 it
was 76% (acceptance monitoring is currently being
implemented in recently acquired companies).

1 Region 1: Italy, USA, Brazil, Poland, Romania,
India.
Region 2: Germany, China, Croatia.
Region 3: United Kingdom, Luxembourg,
Belgium, Netherlands, France, Belarus.

At corporate level, the Code of Ethics was accepted
by 99% of executives, 98% of managers, and 94% of
staff employees.

With regard to suppliers, it should be noted that at
the time of formalising contracts, they are required to
sign a Master Agreement valid at Group level, which
includes specific clauses for accepting the principles
outlined in the Code of Ethics.
