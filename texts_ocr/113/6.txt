LETTER TO STAKEHOLDERS

At a time in history of profound and rapid change,
conditioned by the ongoing digital revolution and
global challenges that require our full attention and
commitment, companies are playing an increasingly
important role in the different and diversified
changes. To guarantee long-term business continuity,
it is now necessary to question the ways in which

we may interact positively with the system, not

only from an economic, but also from a social and
environmental perspective, creating value for all the
company’s stakeholders.

In this context, Reply is typically geared towards
technological innovation and a flexible structure that
can anticipate market developments and pursue new
technological drivers.
The company’s activities have always been based
on the ethical principles of legality, honesty,
transparency, impartiality and respect, which are

 

the underpinning of its corporate culture and part
of the Group’s Code of Ethics, for the benefit of
shareholders, employees, contractors, suppliers,
customers, and business partners. The Group
undertakes to promote and apply these values
when providing its services to customers, acting

as a reliable partner and establishing relationships
based on trust. System security and data protection
are fundamental requirements for the Group and in
recent years it has focused its efforts on defining in-
house tools to ensure compliance with the relevant
regulations in force (e.g. EU European Regulation
2016/679) and the highest standards of service.
Reply considers the advancement and growth of
workers (“Replyers”) to be of priority importance,

as it does the promotion of a collaborative and

stimulating workplace in which equal opportunities

are guaranteed for all. To achieve this goal, over
the years it has activated a series of initiatives and
projects aimed at maximising the potential and talent
of Replyers, and creating a network of professionals
eager to imagine, experiment and study new
solutions.

Finally, although it is a service company with
reduced environmental impact, Reply is committed
to managing its business ensuring respect for the
environment, considering the importance that this
issue has on a global level. In particular, the Group
has implemented a Greenhouse Gas Emission
Control Programme in accordance with the
provisions of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP),
an independent global organisation that monitors
the commitment of companies to mitigate climate
change.
