SOL GROUP - NOTE ON METHODOLOGY

applies to all those who, in various capacities, come
in contact with the Group (such as suppliers, partners,
customers etc.), thus contributing to the achieve-
ment of corporate goals, in accordance with the SOL
Group's mission.

Nevertheless, the Group recognises the importance
of monitoring the supply chain increasingly closely as
this is the area that poses the biggest risks to human
rights. It is also committed to paying more attention
to this issue in order to effectively protect freedom
of association and the right to collective bargaining
and to ensure that forced, irregular or child labour is
banned, also guaranteeing the absence of any form
of employment discrimination.

IDENTIFICATION OF PRIORITY
STAKEHOLDERS AND MATERIAL
ISSUES

The SOL Group believes that doing business in a
sustainable way means creating value for all those
involved in the economic, environmental and social
spheres. To do this, it is necessary to take account of
the opinions and expectations of all of its stakehold-
ers, because it is they who guide the Group’s actions
and push it to improve on a continuous basis.

For this reason, we maintain open channels of com-
munication with all those that can influence the
decisions and actions of the Group and whose actions
and decisions can be influenced by SOL.

The stakeholders considered important to the SOL
Group are:

Associations

Environmental associations

Authorities and public bodies

Shareholders, investors and financial institutions
Patients

Customers

The community

Employees

Suppliers and partners

The definition of material aspects for the Group
and its stakeholders took account of the analyses
carried out by the Group in past years and involved
comparing these material issues with best practices
in the sector, also taking account of the expectations
of stakeholders.

In preparation for the publication of the 2016 Sustain-
ability Report, in early 2017 the Group carried out an
analysis process which, following the identification of
its stakeholders and possible material issues, involved
the direct engagement of a sample of stakeholders
in order to establish the viewpoints of both external
stakeholders and that of the Organisation. ‘?

As well as identifying the material issues to ensure
that the company’s activities, progress, results and
impacts are easily understood, the results of the
analysis constitute a guide for internal departments,
enabling them to identify areas in which to focus their
initiatives in order to improve the impact of the SOL
Group on the environment and on society.

Thanks to a benchmark analysis, in 2017 the Group's
material issues were reviewed, also taking account of
the areas and topics listed by Legislative Decree no.
254/2016. The topics deemed to be material as a
result of these analyses are summarised in the table
in the next page.
