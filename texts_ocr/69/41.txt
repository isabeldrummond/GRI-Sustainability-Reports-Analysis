Finally, the home care service allows patients suffer-
ing from chronic diseases to lead more serene lives in
their homes, avoiding hospitalisation.

For the distribution of bottled products, cylinders,
cylinder baskets, dewars and other mobile recipients
are used. These can all be reused several times and
last up to about 40 years. During their lifetimes these
recipients remain the property of SOL, which makes
them available to its customers. When the cylinder
is empty it is returned by the customer to SOL so it
can be refilled and reused as part of what is a “closed
loop” system. SOL is responsible for all aspects con-
nected with the maintenance and periodic inspection
of the recipients, ensuring that they are safe as well
as suitable and compliant with applicable regulations.
