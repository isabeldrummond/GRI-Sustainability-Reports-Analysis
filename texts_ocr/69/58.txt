At the end of 2017, 3,556 people contributed on
a daily basis to the success of the SOL Group: 1,136
work in Italy and the remaining 2,420 in the other
European countries as well as in Morocco, Brazil
and Turkey. Of these, over 92% have permanent
contracts.

Compared with 2016, there was a 14% increase in
the number of Group employees (177 due to inter-
nal staff increases and 252 following acquisitions).

Also of note is the fact that 32% of new hires are
under 30 years of age and almost 45% of these are
women.

Underlining the close attention it pays to the work-life
balance, the Group currently includes 379 people in
voluntary part-time positions, the equivalent of
10.7% of its total staff with 77% of these roles held
by women.

Data as at December 31st, 2017

Women continue to play an increasingly important
role within the Group, currently accounting for
around 35% of the employees.

The overall turnover comes to 9.5% and is lower in
Italy (5.1%) than abroad (11.5%) due to the different
dynamics of the labour market and the composition
of the workforces.

The overall rate of absenteeism was 3.7% in 2017
but the rates in Italy and abroad were quite different.
In Italy it came to 2.5%, well below both the national
average for the sector and the average for industry as
a whole, while abroad it was 4.1%, still well below the
Eurozone average of around 7.2%.

As well as its employees, the Group also uses external
workers, particularly carriers for the distribution of gas
and nurses for the home care area.
