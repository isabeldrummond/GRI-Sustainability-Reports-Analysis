SOL GROUP - CUSTOMERS, PATIENTS AND SUPPLIERS

SOL for the hospital sector

The SOL Group is aware that new health and ther-
apeutic protocols require scientifically and techno-
logically advanced products, services and devices in
order to achieve the best possible performances and
therapeutic results.

SOL therefore acts as a partner for the supply of
products, services and equipment, allowing the
healthcare system to focus on its core business of
delivering the “health” product to a very particular
customer - “the patient”.

Design and development of medical
devices

The SOL Group is able to design, manufacture and
manage Medical Devices such as centralised plants
for the production and distribution of medical gases,
endocavitary aspiration and the evacuation of anaes-
thetic gases; devices for the administration of drugs,
devices for the emergency management of gases;
supplementary materials, accessories and consuma-
ble materials for the administration of drugs and the
use of gases.

In this context SOL performs accredited analyses for
verifying the quality of the medical gases adminis-
tered at the terminal distribution units.

Total Gas Management services

The Total Gas Management service (TGM) offers
health structures the possibility of minimising the risks
connected with the handling of medical gas packages
and containers and their procurement. The service is
designed case by case in order to satisfy the require-
ments of different organisational models.

The integrated platform InfoHealth®, developed
by Zucchetti, allows the traceability of medical gas
containers and mobile medical devices, the manage-
ment of the stock and the planning of the ordinary
maintenance programme for mobile and fixed med-
ical devices and technology systems. The traceability
form is validated according to Good Manufacturing
Practices, contributing to information security.

Preparation and distribution of
antineoplastic drugs

Healthcare worker safety is a priority also in the design
and construction of laboratories for the preparation
of antineoplastic drugs, where personal exposure to
hazardous chemicals must not exceed strict critical

thresholds. The adoption of the most modern tech-
nologies guarantees precision in the dosing of treat-
ments and eliminates the risk of identifying potential
preparation errors, therefore guaranteeing the utmost
safety of the patient.

Electromedical equipment
management service

SOL also acts as a partner for the routine manage-
ment, operation and emergency management of
electromedical apparatus, from the simplest devices
to diagnostic machinery and life-saving therapy
devices.

Sanitising services

SOL offers specialist hygiene programmes that are
able to meet the needs of public and private users:
from the design, development and operation of ster-
ilisation centres for surgical instruments and units for
the treatment and sanitisation of water and air, to the
supply of personalised integrated services.

Ambulance management services

Patient care begins from the moment they are
transferred to hospital. For this reason, SOL is able
to provide ambulance managers with medical and
electromedical devices for their vehicles, maintenance
and safety verification services, vehicle sanitisation
services and structured and voluntary staff training.

Monitoring service

SOL is able to offer a complete range of services
for environmental, particle and specific substance
monitoring (e.g. anaesthetic gases in operating envi-
ronments), custom-designed for each type of room
in the hospital facility according to the actual risk of
exposure.

Training services

Training in the safe use of medical gases, their con-
tainers and accessories is fundamental for the correct
administration and handling of products.

Training is provided through ECM courses, which
can be accredited upon the request of the customer.
These can be held both residentially and remotely in
order to satisfy the needs of structures and individual
students.
