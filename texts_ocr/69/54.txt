SOL GROUP - LAMBIENTE

THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY APPLIED
TO HOME CARE

In 2017 the SOL Group took part in the C.E.R.CA.
project promoted by Assolombarda in collaboration
with Bocconi University and IEFE. The goal of this
project was to quantify and analyse the envi-
ronmental impact connected with the life cycle of
an invasive mechanical ventilation kit, purchased
and marketed by Vivisol and used for the home tre-
atment of patients that suffer from chronic respiratory
insufficiency.

The project compared the current scenario, in which the
items of the kit not used by the patient and therefore
still sealed and sterile are sent for disposal in their enti-
rety, with an alternative scenario in which these items
are recovered and issued to a new patient following a
quality check by the manufacturer.

The study was based on the Life Cycle Assessment
(LCA) methodology, which examines environmental
aspects and potential impacts throughout the entire
life cycle of the product.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY SCENARIO

? Distribution

 

Considering all patients treated in Italy in 2017, the
study demonstrated an advantage in terms of kg of
CO, equivalent avoided in the circular economy scena-
tio as compared with the variable current scenario of a
maximum of 1,863 tonnes a year, depending on the
rate of recovery of the kits. These tons are equivalent to
those that a car running on petrol would emit to circle
the Earth 240 times.

The project quantified the advantages of a circular
economy scenario; these results will be shared with the
main producers, who are the fundamental stakeholder
in this process.
