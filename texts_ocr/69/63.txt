SOL GROUP - PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY

HEALTH AND SAFETY

The SOL Group continued its efforts to consolidate an
informed health and safety culture among its employ-
ees in 2017.

One key milestone in this process was without doubt
the adoption in 2016 of the ten “Lifesaving Rules”
whose application by all employees contributes to
achieving the goal of bringing all units to zero
accidents.

The Rules were disseminated in 2017 also via the
company intranet and with the support of informa-
tion materials (posters, leaflets, etc.) that were distrib-
uted to all Group employees.

The promotion and spread of the health and safety
culture is guaranteed by the HSE Department, which
serves all Group companies, and supported by the
Safety and Environment Reference Person appointed
for each Group company.

Employee training is of the utmost importance: all
employees are involved in constant awareness and
training activities aimed at reducing the possible
impact of our activities on the environment and
ensuring high levels of workplace safety. To this
end, periodic meetings are organised, also with the

contribution of external specialists, to enhance exper-
tise but also to stimulate collaboration between units
and share management methods.

In 2017 the annual update on employee safety
at the Monza site was organised: the course “Lit-
tle efforts for a safer environment” focused on
behaviours that could compromise safety outside the
work environment. With an interactive and engaging
game, it was explained how accidents, including
those at home, can be avoided by paying just a little
bit more attention.

The SOL Group has various specific communication
instruments: these include the “Safety alerts”, which
by highlighting events that have taken place in the
sector urge employees to respect correct rules of con-
duct, and the “Quarterly Accident Reports”, which
explain and analyse accidents that have occurred in
the Group and in other companies in the sector that
belong to Assogastecnici and EIGA.

The Group's injury and lost day rate continue to fall,
coming to 2.9 and 51 respectively in 2017.

In 2017 the “zero accidents” goal was met by 89%

of the companies in Italy and 82% of the companies
abroad.
