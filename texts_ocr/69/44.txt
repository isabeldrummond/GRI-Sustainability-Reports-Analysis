SOL GROUP - CUSTOMERS, PATIENTS AND SUPPLIERS

 

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

Customer satisfaction is periodically monitored through
ad hoc surveys.

In 2017, in particular, several monitoring activities
were carried out by SOL in Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia,
France, Greece, Ireland, Morocco and Slovenia, invol-
ving around 600 customers. In the home care area,
Vivisol in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Direct
Medical in Ireland, and Sitex in Switzerland have con-
ducted surveys of more than 8,000 clients/patients.

 

SUPPLIERS

The SOL Group implements a supply policy that guar-
antees all potential suppliers equal opportunities to
propose their products and services. It also establishes
that relationships with them are managed according
to criteria of impartiality, honesty and openness to
competition.

When selecting its partners for the supply of goods
and services that are critical for safety, quality and
the environment, SOL uses a qualifying process
to establish whether a potential partner meets the
requirements demanded by company procedures.

Possession of these requisites is verified by objective
methods such as the filling out of questionnaires and,
where necessary, the carrying out of audits at supplier
premises.

During 2017, 81 supplier audits were performed (30
in 2016), which concerned mainly aspects connected
to quality, environment and health and safety.

In the United Kingdom, Dolby Vivisol collects custo-
mer feedback at each visit, involving approximately
32,900 patients in 2017.

Furthermore, some key performance indicators (KPIs)
are constantly monitored (customer complaints,
response times to customer orders and patient
requests, etc.) in order to promptly activate the neces-
sary corrective actions.

Suppliers are required to read and adhere to the
Group Code of Ethics and, in Italy, also the Organi-
sation, Management and Control Model pursuant to
Legislative Decree no. 231/01, as well as the Group's
safety and environment policies.

The companies that are part of the SOL Group are
essentially ‘local’ businesses. Production facilities
are built close to customers and distribution is usually
carried out within the home country of the vendor
company. The supply chain is therefore relatively sim-
ple and suppliers are mostly locally-based.

The main products and services purchased by the
Group companies are electricity and transport, main-
tenance and technical assistance services. There is a
wider choice of suppliers available for capital goods:
sales media (cylinders, tanks, tankers, etc.), systems
and equipment.
