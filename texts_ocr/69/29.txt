OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION IN THE ALUMINIUM
SECTOR: A HIGH-EFFICIENCY SOL TECHNOLOGY

The recycling of scrap aluminium has become
increasingly important because it makes it possi-
ble to save huge amounts of energy (up to 95%)
compared with producing the same alloys obtained
using bauxite (the mineral from which aluminium
is produced). In addition, because it can be recy-
cled ad infinitum without losing its properties, the
production of aluminium from scrap represents an
excellent example of the circular economy.

SOL provides its customers with cutting-edge alu-
minium melting techniques based on the technol-
ogy of oxy-fuel combustion, which uses technical
oxygen as a fuel. These techniques exploit the
different types of scrap available on the market,
drastically reducing gaseous emissions while having
only a limited energy impact.

 

In 2017 SOL launched a new application in Italy
at a melting furnace with high scrap aluminium
capacity, which is also able to use low quality scrap,
significantly limiting losses due to oxidation (addi-
tional waste) and atmospheric emissions.

This was feasible thanks to the use of specially
designed burners for this type of application and
the use of oxygen combustion, which makes it pos-
sible to recover the energy contained in the waste
in the melting process itself (post-combustion),
with consequent savings in fuel, a reduction in
melting times, a reduction in the quantity of waste
by-products, an increase in production capacity and
an increased flexibility of the melting furnace.
