Aldo Fumagalli Romario
found the SOL Group
with the first two
oxygen and acetylene
production sites in
Livorno and Ancona.

 

Alessandro and
Renzo Annoni, Giulio
and Ugo Fumagalli
Romario, the second
generation, launch
an ambitious project
for the innovative

development of SOL:

these are the years
of the first technical
gas production
plants, located close
to the Group’s major
key customers, such
as steelworks and
glassmakers.

HISTORY

SOL GROUP - OURIDENTITY

SOL switches from a
regional to a national

strategy, embracing the
major transformations

'
taking place in the
technical gas industry
at the time due to
technologies for the

the development of
storage and distribution
of the gases in
cryogenic liquid state.
This enables SOL to
become a leading
operator on the
Italian market.

1984

As of 1984 the Group
begins to look towards
Europe, developing
sites and branches and
launching joint ventures
in most European
countries as well as
taking advantage of the
opportunities stemming
from the opening of
new markets in South-
East Europe.

     
 

  
     
       

SOL is one of the first
companies in Europe to
introduce a new form of
treatment, developed

in the US, for patients
affected with serious
respiratory disorders.
This treatment involves
significant quantities

of oxygen and a

highly specialist home
care service. In 1986
the Group sets up a
company specifically for
the development of this
market, Vivisol, which
initially specialises in
oxygen therapy before
expanding its activities
in the respiratory care
sector and the area of
home care services.
