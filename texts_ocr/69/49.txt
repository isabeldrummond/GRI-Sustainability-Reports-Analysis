SOL GROUP - THE ENVIRONMENT

The types of plants listed in the previous page repre-
sent the reporting scope of environmental data within
the Sustainability Report, unless otherwise indicated.

The activities of the SOL Group have a fairly limited
impact on biodiversity as the production units are
relatively small and located in industrial areas.

 

Furthermore, the substances produced and handled
by the SOL Group do not pose a contamination risk to
the soil and subsoil. Some SOL Units have been con-
structed in locations that have soil and groundwater
contamination problems, but these have other causes
and predated the arrival of SOL.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION

The SOL Group's activities use electricity, methane
and steam as energy vectors.

Its methane and steam consumption is negligible
and, as such, this report only analyses the consump-
tion of electricity, one of the critical factors in the air
separation process for the production of cryogenic
gases. In fact, both the compression and liquefying of
gas are highly energy-intensive operations: as a result,
it is estimated that the energy consumption of the
primary production plants accounts for about
90% of the Group's energy consumption.

In light of its highly energy-intensive activities, since
2002 the Group has invested in the production
of energy from renewable sources, acquiring 7
hydroelectric power plants and constructing 8 ones,
of a total installed capacity of around 30 MW dis-
tributed across 15 power stations in Slovenia, Albania,
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia. In 2017
the electricity they produced was equal to 77 GWh,
accounted for 14.3% of the Group’s energy consump-
tion, down 41% compared with 2016 due to the lower
amount of rainfall recorded during the year.

The actions to reduce energy consumption are not
limited to the optimisation of processes and careful
plant management but also extend to the design
and choice of plant solutions and the upgrading of
the machinery used in plants, to which an important
percentage of the investment budget is set aside
each year.

Consumption is however considerably influenced by
customer demand and the start-up (or shutdown) of
production plants.

More specifically, the increase in energy consumption
in 2017 is due to the start-up of the Augusta air
separation unit which entered into regular operation
at the start of the year. Nevertheless, there was an
improvement in the efficiency ratio compared
with 2016 due to the commissioning of new plants
and the investments made to modernise the existing
ones.
