 

SOL GROUP - PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY

Vivisol supports the Serena Foundation NPO, an
association for the protection, assistance and care
of people with SLA and other muscular dystrophies;
the Vivi Down Association NPO, which every day
provides people with Down Syndrome and _ their
families tools to alleviate the difficulties that this
disability involves; and UILDM (Unione Italiana Lotta
alla Distrofia Muscolare), the national association for
those affected by dystrophy and other neuromuscular
diseases.

In 2017, Vivisol worked with the Centro Nazionale
Opere Salesiane, which every year organises the
“Techniques for the maintenance, repair and testing
of diagnostic devices” training course. As part of the
course, students were able to learn about the reality
of home care services and visit SOL Welding, the site
in Vicenza that manages medical apparatus.

n Bosnia and Herzegovina SOL supported the com-
munity by helping to meet the needs of an infant school.

n Spain Vivisol sponsored the “Running for Health”
event in Seville and contributed to organising the
Day for complex chronic patients. Vivisol supports the
“Barcelona Respiratory Network” and the pulmonol-
ogy company in Seville.

n France Vivisol, France Oxygéne and MBAR sup-
orted organisations for clinical research into respira-
tory illnesses. SOL supported Saint Savin rugby club
and ETP Chimio, an association that supports cancer
atients.

 

n the Netherlands Vivisol supported various sci-
entific studies and conferences on respiratory med-
icine. These include the “Homerun” scientific study
which involves the remote monitoring of a sample
of patients receiving pulmonary ventilation in order
to demonstrate that home treatment is just as safe
as hospital treatment, and costs less. Furthermore,
for the annual Breathless symposium, Vivisol chose
a reusable bottle (“Join the Pipe”) as its gadget for
participants. For every bottle purchased, the com-
pany that manufactures them sends one to a child
in Africa. The children that receive these bottles can
then take water from the village pump to school, a

great benefit given that schools often do not have
any drinking water.

Still in the Netherlands, SOL supports NGO Stichting
MOS, which provides medical assistance during sports
events.

United Kingdom: Dolby Vivisol supports various
associations such as the British Heart Foundation
and the BLF — British Lung Foundation. It works with
the National Health Service to guarantee that the
presence of asbestos in patient homes is communi-
cated so that technicians can work safely during the
installation phase.

ASSOCIATIONS

The SOL Group actively participates in the initiatives
of the main associations of companies in the techni-
cal and medical gases, home care and biotechnology

of technical knowledge and the drafting and
updating of sector standards.

International industry associations

pal objective of the association is to coordinate the
harmonisation of safety rules so that operational
practices are the same throughout the world.

SOL Spa, SOL Nederland, BTG, SOL Deutschland,
