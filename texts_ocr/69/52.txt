particularly with the purchase of next-generation

between the weight of the transported product
and the total weight;

e the adoption of logistics management methods
aimed at optimising routes.

WASTE

The majority of the waste produced derives from

activities:

e in the primary production plants, connected
with maintenance activities: non-hazardous
waste (mainly scrap iron, packaging and insulating
materials) and hazardous waste (mainly used oil,
used for the lubrication of machines, and ammo-
nia solution from ammonia conditioning);

e inthe Group’s specialist maintenance centres:
testing of cylinders and cryogenic containers,
repair of electric and electronic equipment.

The only waste material directly generated by the
production processes adopted in the Group’s Units
is calcium hydroxide, a by-product of the acetylene
production process which, when it can’t be sold as
a sub-product, must be disposed of as hazardous or
non-hazardous waste depending on its characteristics.
