SOL GROUP - NOTE ON METHODOLOGY

The Sustainability Report has been prepared under
the “GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards”
established in 2016 by GRI - Global Reporting Initi-
ative, in accordance with the Core option, with refer-
ence to the information reported in the GRI Content
Index, included in this Report.

The Sustainability Report constitutes the Consolidated
non-financial statement and fulfils the requirements
of Articles 3 and 4 of Italian Legislative Decree
no. 254/2016, which implements European Directive
2014/95/EU into Italian law. As established by Art.
5 of Legislative Decree no. 254/16, this document
constitutes a separate report market by a specific
heading. Where appropriate, the European Commis-
sion Guidelines on non-financial reporting were also
taken into account.

The Sustainability Report reporting scope
includes all companies consolidated on a line-
by-line basis by SOL Spa. For environmental data
and information more details are provided in “The
environment” chapter, which explains any eventual
variations in scope of reporting, which do not limit the
understanding of the Group's activities or its impact.
The reporting scope of the economic and financial
data and information corresponds to that of the SOL
Group's Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31
December 2017.

The information contained in the Report refers to
issues identified as material and the related indi-
cators that reflect the significant economic, envi-
ronmental and social impacts of the organisation
or that could substantially influence the evaluations
and decisions of the Group's stakeholders. The mate-
riality analysis, updated in 2017, is of key importance,
acting as a guideline for defining the content to
report, in line with the expectations of stakeholders.

Following the materiality analysis of the issues out-
lined in Article 3 of Legislative Decree no. 254/2016,
the use of water resources and the emissions of other
pollutants other than greenhouse gases are not
deemed significant to be reported in this document.

 

The content of this Report refers to 2017 and, in
particular, the activities carried out by the SOL Group
during the year, unless otherwise noted. Data relating
to previous years is reported where possible for com-
parative purposes, making it possible to assess longer-
term trends in the Group's activities.

In order to guarantee the reliability of the reported
information recourse to estimates was limited as far
as possible. Any eventual estimates are based on
the best information available or survey sampling.
Restatements to previously published comparative
data are clearly indicated.

The Report was subject to a limited assurance
engagement according to the criteria set out by the
ISAE 3000 Revised principle. This engagement was car-
ried out by Deloitte & Touche Spa which, at the end of
the work performed, issued a specific report with regard
to the compliance of the information provided in the
consolidated non-financial statement prepared by SOL
Group as required by the Legislative Decree 254/2016.

The SOL Group has published an annual Sustainabil-
ity Report since 2009.

The Sustainability Report was approved by the
SOL Spa Board of Directors on March 29, 2018.

The Group has envisaged a continuous improve-
ment process with regard to material sustainability
issues in order to comply in an increasingly virtuous
way with regulations and best practices in the sec-
tor. More specifically, with regard to the theme of
respecting human rights, in 2006 the Group adopted
a Code of Ethics (updated in 2017) which has specific
provisions on human rights issues. In fact, SOL Group
undertakes to support the protection and defence of
human rights according to the principles laid down by
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948),
and acknowledges the principles established by the
basic Conventions of the ILO (International Labour
Organization). The Code of Ethics applies to everyone
who carries out work for the SOL Group (including all
employees, interns, agency staff) and administrators
of SOL Group companies. The Code of Ethics also
