SOL GROUP - PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY

SOME STAFF DEVELOPMENT
INITIATIVES

People are the focus of the SOL Group's attention,
particularly when it comes to initiatives designed to
develop, enhance and incentivise personal perfor-
mances: the Group strongly believes that the contin-
uous updating of expertise and professional growth
constitute strategic investments.

In order to manage expertise and promote progres-
sive training to foster the loyalty of its employees,
the SOL Group organises specialist and executive
technical training programmes. A total of 50,501
training hours were supplied in 2017, the equivalent
of around 14 hours per employee (13 hours per
employee were provided in 2016).

The activities of the Academies, aimed at various
“professional families” and organised to strengthen
the professional training process, continued in 2017.

2017 saw the conclusion of the Fly High programme,
the process launched in 2016 to identify and develop
talent within the SOL Group. The project represented
an important opportunity to align the expectations of
individuals with the strategies and needs of the Group
with the goal of fostering continuous growth. After an
initial meeting involving team building activities and
project management training, with the help of a few
head office managers the participants developed
a business plan on a project idea assigned to them.
The projects of the two winning groups were later pre-
sented during the annual meeting of the SOL Group
senior managers in December.

For the sales force of the foreign companies in the
medical sector, the SOL Group organised four days
of interactive management training involving simula-
tions and business games, with the aim of strength-
ening loyalty and the ability to work as part of ateam,
and improving decision-making and problem-solving
abilities.

In France, Vivisol carried out a training program involv-
ing approximately 76 employees for two days on the
subject of road security and the promotion of gender
equality with the participation of the management.
