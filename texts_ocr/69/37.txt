Design and development of biobanks

The service of designing and developing ISO 9001
certified cryobiological rooms is aimed at public and
private structures that carry out scientific research and
manipulation for cell, tissue and organ transplants
and that need to preserve their biological samples for
long periods of time in liquid nitrogen.

Disaster Recovery

The Disaster Recovery service guarantees public
and private structures the transfer, in emergency
situations, of biological samples to cryobiological
rooms owned by the SOL Group. In particular, Cryolab
is authorised by the Italian Ministry of Health and
the Italian National Transplant Centre for the long-
term and disaster recovery conservation of human
gametes.

Bioshipping

The Bioshipping service provided by Cryolab makes
it possible to transport biological samples between
health structures in completely safe and traceable
conditions, with the continuous monitoring of all
parameters.

This service is becoming increasingly popular and
important, and is also used for delicate and often
unique samples such as gametes. Cryolab is able to
satisfy the reliability and very high specialisation
requirements established by applicable regulations
for Medically Assisted Procreation structures.

 

Genomic diagnostics

Biotechsol provides pre- and post-natal diagnostic
screening services which are important for ensuring
the correct development of new-born babies as they
enable the early diagnosis of numerous diseases
which, if diagnosed in time, can be treated.

Diatheva diagnostic systems are innovative because
they permit the identification and quantification
of pathogens through DNA amplification techniques
in any matrix and for any requirement.

Compared with traditional techniques, such as cul-
tures, the new Diatheva systems can reduce the time
required to obtain results to just a few hours and
are aimed principally at the food and environmental
control sectors where fast analytical results are critical
for taking decisions that affect the safety of people
and the environment.

Through its subsidiary Cryolab, the SOL Group is now
active in the research and development of protocols
for cell manipulation and in particular stem cells, the
new frontier of regenerative medicine.

In 2017 these activities were joined by genetic and
bioinformatic analyses thanks to the accredited Per-
sonal Genomics laboratory, which makes Next Gen-
eration Sequencing technologies and advanced
bioinformatic tools available to preventive and preci-
sion medicine.
