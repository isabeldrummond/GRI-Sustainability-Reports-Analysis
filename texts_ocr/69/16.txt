SOLGROUP — GOVERNANCE SYSTEM

 

 

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The SOL Group corporate governance and control sys-
tem, founded on the central role played by the Board
of Directors of parent company SOL Spa, revolves
around the balanced representation and roles of the
corporate bodies, interaction with stakeholders
and transparency, both towards the market and in
internal procedures.

The SOL governance structure comprises the follow-
ing bodies: Board of Directors, Shareholders’ Meeting,
Board of Statutory Auditors and Independent Audi-
tors. The Board of Directors directs and governs the
business, pursuing the goal of creating value for its
shareholders, in strict compliance with the law and
the Group’s mission and values.

All of the most significant projects, including those
relating to sustainability performances, are assessed
by the Board of Directors.

THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

The SOL Group internal control system is a series of
processes designed to guarantee the honesty, trans-
parency, efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of
corporate management, as well as respect for laws,
and to prevent fraud that damages the company.
The system is guided by the Code of Ethics and all
internal regulations and procedures, including those
of the integrated Quality, Safety and Environmental
management system.

Both SOL Spa and Vivisol Srl have adopted the Organ-
isation, management and control model estab-
lished by Italian Legislative Decree no. 231/2001 and
subsequent amendments and additions, which forms
an integral part of the internal control system.

The first versions of the two Models date back to
2006 and have been subsequently updated to take
account of acquired management experience, the
introduction of new offences and related laws. The
two Models were last updated during 2016 following
the introduction of new environmental offences and
the crime of self-laundering.

The SOL Group's commitment to protecting and
respecting the principles of the free market and
competition was recently consolidated and strength-
ened through its adoption of the Antitrust Compli-
ance Program and approval and dissemination of
two new documents that clearly and succinctly out-
line the core principles of the regulation to observe:
the Antitrust Code and a more practical Handbook.

The Antitrust Code ensures that the core values in
terms of protecting competition are well known and
constitute a standard of conduct for all SOL Group
personnel when carrying out their respective activities.
The Handbook summarises the main rules of conduct.

The Antitrust Function was created at the same time.
Covered by the Legal Affairs Department for Italy and
by the Country Managers for the Group's non-Italian
companies. It is responsible for monitoring the imple-
mentation of the Antitrust programme and providing
assistance in this area to everyone in the Group.
Among its other duties, the Antitrust Function also
organises training events to promote the awareness
and understanding of the contents of the regulation.

The systematic monitoring of the correct application
of the corporate governance principles takes place
via a system that involves the presence of dedicated
company structures which carry out monitoring, con-
trol and risk management activities.

The Board of Directors of parent company SOL Spa
has created the Internal Control Function which is
tasked with ensuring that internal operating and
administrative procedures are correctly respected.

The person in charge of the Internal Control Func-
tion does not answer to any departmental manager
but directly to the top management. Verification
activities are performed both at the management
offices of the Monza headquarters and at the sites of
the Group's operating companies.

Both SOL Spa and Vivisol Srl have also formed their
own Supervisory Bodies which, equipped with the
appropriate instruments and the necessary independ-
ence, verify compliance with the Organisation, man-
agement and control model pursuant to Legislative
Decree no. 231/2001 and, together with the Country
Managers, respect for the Code of Ethics.
