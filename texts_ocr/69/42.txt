SOL GROUP - CUSTOMERS, PATIENTS AND SUPPLIERS

TECHNOLOGIES FOR INDUSTRY

Given the growing sensitivity of customers to envi-
ronmental and safety matters, the SOL Group has
invested in the identification and development
of innovative technologies which, starting with an
understanding of customers’ needs and using the pro-
ducts supplied, make it possible to improve working
conditions from an environmental, economic and
safety point of view.

Improving water quality: the use of oxygen in
wastewater treatment makes the purification process
more effective, reducing environmental impact and
ensuring better control over the treatment.

Disinfection with ozone protects the watercourses
where wastewater is re-emitted after treatment from
bacterial pollution and also avoids the use of chlorine
compounds.

Reduction of energy consumption and emis-
sions: in the metal and glass industries the use of
oxy-combustible burners developed by SOL permits
more efficient combustion than using only air, with
a consequent reduction in energy consumption and
atmospheric emissions.

On-site plants: Producing gas directly on industrial

customer premises using on-site plants significantly

contributes to protecting the environment because it
makes it possible to:

e reduce the atmospheric pollution associated with
road transport, typical of traditional supplies in
cylinders or tanks;

e reduce energy consumption since the production
process, specialising in just a single gas with spe-
cific characteristics, consumes less energy than a
traditional centralised plant.

Promotion of more sustainable transport: the use
of fuels with lower environmental impact, like lique-
fied natural gas, makes it possible to reduce emissions
deriving from the circulation of cars, buses and lorries.

Increase in safety: the use of inerting nitrogen con-
tributes to the safety of industrial installations.

Reduction of pollutants: controlling pH with CO,
replaces the use of mineral acids (sulphuric and hydro-
chloric) which leave pollutants in the water. Modified
atmosphere packaging protects food products while
reducing the use of chemical preservatives.

HEALTHCARE SERVICES

The SOL Group is constantly looking for answers to
the health management challenges that are posed
both by hospitals and by patients who use home care
services.

That's why SOL believes that it is necessary for hospi-
tals to be supplied not only with traditional medical
gases (oxygen and nitrous oxide), but also with the
equipment to use them and, above all, services that
enable customers and doctors to focus on the main
purpose of their activities, namely patient care.

The safety of patients, operators and all those pre-
sent for various reasons in the places where medical
gases and services are supplied, managed and admi-
nistered is a primary objective. The experience we
have acquired and the continuous exchange of infor-
mation enables SOL to introduce innovations to pro-
ducts and services with the aim, among other things,
of making them inherently safer: examples include
the integrated reducing valves for compressed gas
packages, safety and protective devices for handling
cryogenic gases and the safety and monitoring sen-
sors for the rapid analysis of hazardous atmospheres.

We also seek to reduce the environmental impact of
our activities by improving the efficiency of tran-
sportation, by optimising stocks through the use
of management systems that keep track of packages
distributed within healthcare facilities, and by digita-
lising accounting documents and reports.
