Focus on the customer

The development plan of the SOL Group focuses on
continual research into innovative technological
solutions which, through the use of the technical
gases it produces in its plants and markets, enable its
customers to pursue goals in the area of energy and
production efficiency, the improvement of environ-
mental compatibility and the protection of the
health of their employees.

   

Gases produced and distributed:

Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon, Hydrogen, Carbon dioxide, Sulphur
dioxide, Acetylene, Nitrous oxide, Gas mixtures, High purity
gases, Food gases, Gaseous helium, Liquid helium, Gases for
electronics, Ammonia, Combustible gases for industrial use
and liquefied natural gas (LNG).

To achieve these objectives the proposed solutions
not only concern the supply of technical gases but
also the development of applied technologies, the
construction of the plants and the provision of the
services necessary for using the gases.

The products, technologies and services have been
developed with a focus on the needs of the cus-
tomer and are able to cover all industrial sectors
potentially concerned.
