SOL GROUP

In the technical gas area, a majority stake was acquired in Turkish company Gebze Gaz, which has a filling site
close to Istanbul. In Italy, SOL acquired a majority shareholding in Puglia-based family businesses Sterimed and
ReMi. which operate in the clinical engineering and sterilisation sector, mainly for clinics and hospitals, enriching
the range of hospital services of the Group which, for its part, provides the two companies with new growth
opportunities in Europe.

Finally, in the biotech area, SOL acquired a controlling stake in Personal Genomics, a University of Verona spin
off, which creates new opportunities in this area thanks also to the synergies with the Group's other biotech
companies - Biotechsol, Diatheva and Cryolab in particular.

The Group’s turnover grew by 8% compared with 2016, maintaining a good level of profitability, thanks also to
its significant investments, which in 2017 came to 99 million euros.

The economic climate appears to be more positive in 2018 compared with 2017 and, as in the past, the SOL
Group is ready to reap the fruits of the tireless hard work of all of its employees whose attention is focused
closely on the customer and on meeting the ongoing needs of patients, fulfilling the expectations of the share-
holders and all stakeholders with whom they interact on a daily basis.
