SOL GROUP - THE ENVIRONMENT

 

WATER CONSUMPTION AND WASTEWATER

For the SOL Group, managing water resources means:

¢ optimising the use of water in its plants by redu-
cing withdrawals to a minimum, also through
investments in recycling;

e research and application at customer sites of
technologies which, by using technical gases,
can improve processes such as the treatment
of wastewater or the purification of water for
public use.

Most of the withdrawn water is used in the cooling circuits
of machinery in primary process units. These systems are

closed circuit: the consumed water is the water reintrodu-
ced into the circuit to compensate for evaporation.

The quantities used in secondary process units and offices
are negligible and are therefore not reported.

The 2017 figure is slightly up due to the launch of the
Augusta plant.

Production plant wastewater is periodically controlled.
The analyses show that concentrations are well below the
legal limits.

GENOMIC DIAGNOSIS FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

It is possible to sequence the DNA not only of human
beings, but also of all living organisms; hence the
possibility of applying genomics to micro-organisms
responsible for the pollution of water, air and soil.

The INTCATCH project, which involves Personal
Genomics, aims to develop strategies and monitoring
systems for surface waters, thanks to the use of innova-
tive and user-friendly technologies, able to provide data
and parameters in real time.

Physico-chemical, biological and genomic analysis
will be conducted with a fleet of autonomous and
radio-controlled aquatic drones, equipped with innova-
tive sensors and DNA test kits. The subject of the study
will be Lake Garda in Italy and the River Thames in the
United Kingdom, while research and results obtained

will be validated on Lake Yliki in Greece and on the Ter
River in Spain.

The data collected will be made available to the
communities and to the inhabitants living in the area
under analysis, and to all the stakeholders interested
in the project.

The business model will enable community groups and
NGOs to improve water governance through a sustain-
able quality management, using cloud data linked to a
decision support system and environmentally friendly
technologies.

The project, funded by the Horizon2020 program,
involves six European universities and fourteen institu-
tions (including public and private European companies).
