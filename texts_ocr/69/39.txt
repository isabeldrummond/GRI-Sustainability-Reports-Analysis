The production of technical gases is highly dependent
on electricity, which is mostly produced from fossil
fuels like gas, coal and oil that have a considerable
negative impact on the environment.

One of the objectives the SOL Group has pursued
since 2002 is the production of electricity from
renewable sources in order to mitigate the indirect
environmental impact of its activities.

Thanks to the electricity generated in its power sta-
tions, in 2017 the forecast reduction in the Group's
atmospheric CO, emissions came to over 40,157 t.
These tons are equivalent to those that a car running
on petrol would emit to circle the Earth 5,100 times.
