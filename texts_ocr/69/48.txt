MAIN ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

The table shows the raw materials used for the main
types of plants and the environmental aspects con-

The most important environmental aspects for the
SOL Group relate to the use of electricity in its produc-

N° RAW MATERIALS

The process of air separation for the
production of oxygen, nitrogen and argon
is a physical one. It is a process that uses
atmospheric air as raw material.

These use natural gas and water (steam) as
raw materials, which chemically react with
each other to produce hydrogen.

These use ammonium nitrate, either solid or in
water solution, as a raw material in a thermal
dissociation process.

These use calcium carbide as a raw material, a
solid that decomposes in water.

The raw material is carbon dioxide itself,
obtained as a by-product from chemical
plants or from natural underground deposits.
The carbon dioxide is purified and liquefied
with the use of energy.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

The process has significant indirect
environmental impacts because it uses a great
deal of electricity. On the other hand, it does
not use raw materials other than atmospheric
air and emits negligible amounts of CO,,,
sulphur oxides (SO,) and nitrogen oxides
(NO,), already present in the treated air.

Hydrogen production plants emit CO, as a
sub product of the chemical reaction and
negligible quantities of nitrogen oxides (NO,),
and consume natural gas to produce steam.

N,0 production plants can emit the gas
produced (greenhouse gas) from their
vents, and consume electricity to bring the
ammonium nitrate to reaction temperature.

One by-product of this process is calcium
hydroxide which, where possible, is used in
industry or agriculture.

CO, production plants can emit the gas
produced (greenhouse gas) from their vents.
On the other hand, the carbon dioxide
obtained in this way is reused in industrial
applications instead of being emitted directly
into the atmosphere.
