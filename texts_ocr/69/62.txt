SOL GROUP - PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY

REMUNERATION AND SOCIAL
BENEFITS

The SOL Group makes no distinction between the
genders in the management of remuneration policies
which, for each role, are based on merit, competences
and results.

Where required by local legislation in the countries in
which it operates, the SOL Group applies the collec-
tive contracts for the relevant sector or, alterna-
tively, salaries above the minimum legal wage.

On average, wages and salaries, which are monitored
by local managers and Personnel and Legal Affairs
Central Management, are in line with or better than
those established by the reference contracts.

In 2017 the overall salary paid to Chairman and CEO
Aldo Fumagalli Romario was 13.53 times the average
overall salary of Group employees in Italy.

Every year, all managers are required to evaluate
the performances of their staff and to refer wage
increase and/or career development proposals to the
relevant departments and Personnel and Legal Affairs
Central Management.

In any case, the wage increases established by collec-
tive industry contracts or by law are guaranteed and,
where union representation is present, supplementary
contracts are negotiated that can include, as is the
case in Italy, France and Macedonia, production and/
or participation bonuses connected with productivity,
company profitability and accident rate parameters.

In countries where there is collective bargaining, the
Group strives to incentivise tools that protect the
health of employees and their families, and those
that integrate the pension services established
by local laws.

INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS

Personnel and Legal Affairs Central Management
directly manages industrial relations for all Italian
companies in the Group and coordinates them for
overseas companies, intervening when necessary.

SOL is an active member of the chemical industry
confederation (Federchimica) and takes part in
negotiations in Italy for the renewal of the chemical
and chemical-pharmaceutical national collective
labour agreements and in other joint schemes by the
social partners.

At corporate level SOL maintains periodic relations
with its unions based on the utmost cooperation and
transparency.

67.5% of the SOL Group’s employees are covered
by collective labour agreements, including 100% of
Italian employees and 52.2% of employees in other
countries.

No labour disputes occurred in any of the Group
companies and in 2017 there were no recorded
hours of strike action. The difficult negotiations for
the renewal of the company contract in the Group's
Macedonian companies also concluded positively
with the signing of a satisfactory agreement for both
parties on 28/2/2018.

During the year the transfer of mobile container test-
ing activities from a unit in Northern Italy to a new
and larger centre built in the province of Caserta was
completed. The repercussions on the employees were
very limited thanks to the transfer of the majority
of staff to other activities at the same unit and the
incentivisation of personal enterprise initiatives.

"The overall salary includes gross annual remuneration plus the variable components. All employees of SOL Spa and of the other companies whose payroll is man

aged directly by the HR Department are considered.
