In 2017, area of technical gases showed a 7.3%
increase in sales compared to the previous year.
This growth was more marked in other European
countries than in Italy and it was greater especially
in the mechanical engineering, food and chemical
industries.

The hospital sector, on the other hand, has found sta-
bility, with margins shrinking due to both the policies
to reduce spending and strong competition.

The home care business had a good growth (+7.9%)
achieved more in foreign countries, thanks to a con-
tinuous commitment in the development of new
products and services, which flanks and complements
the oxygen therapy activities.

As far as cost are concerned, it should be noted
that gross operating margin maintained the same
absolute level as in 2016, despite having seen both

a reduction in production and sales of hydroelectric
energy following the very low rainfall in 2016, and
higher maintenance costs for installations for unfore-
seen events.

The operating result decreased by 4.7 million euros
compared to 2016, also due to higher amortization
and provisions for 4.4 million euros.

The Group's net debt increased by 23.2 million euros
against because of the technical investments and the
acquisitions made in 2017.

Indebtedness indices remain very solid, with the debt/
equity ratio of 0.50 and the cash flow cover equal to
1.52.

Financial data refer to the draft annual report approved by the Board of Directors on March 29th, 2018.
