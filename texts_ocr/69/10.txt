SOL GROUP - OURIDENTITY

 

MISSION AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLES

The Group's mission is to provide its customers with
innovative and technologically advanced solu-
tions at all times and to offer patients the best pos-
sible home care services, contributing to improving
the quality of life on the planet.

The values in which the SOL Group believes and from
which it takes daily inspiration are:

Ethical behaviour: in interpersonal relations, towards
employees, customers, suppliers and all stakeholders.

Safety: we regard the workplace safety of all employ-
ees, as well as the safety of the products and services
we provide to our customers and patients, as priority
issues.

Customer satisfaction: we are committed to provid-
ing our customers with innovative and technologically
advanced solutions at all times and to improving the
quality of life of our patients, guaranteeing them the
best treatment and the best possible home care.

Balanced development: we work to create balanced
economic growth and constant development in the
long term, employing resources efficiently and con-
stantly guiding them towards change.

Environmental protection: we seek to safeguard the
environment by optimising processes, and therefore
using energy resources in the best possible way, and
by developing technologies and services that help our
customers improve their environmental efficiency.

Human resource development: we view attracting
and developing the loyalty of new talents and, in
general, training and developing the capacities of
individuals as key to the success of the SOL Group.

The SOL Group adopted a Code of Ethics in 2006
in order to clearly and transparently define the set
of values and principles that inspire the SOL Group
companies when pursuing their goals, observing
national and international regulations with respect
for the legitimate interests of the different categories
of stakeholders.

The Code was reviewed in 2017 with the aim of
further highlighting the principles and conduct that
must characterise relationships with all stakeholders.
A clear and simple style was adopted to make sure
that the contents are immediately comprehensible.

The Code is a tool for governing the company and fos-
tering sustainability in the SOL Group, representing a
set of guidelines for the day-to-day activities of its
stakeholders. Among the various issues addressed,
of particular importance are the respect for human
and individual rights, the prevention and fighting of
corruption, and the safeguarding of workplace health
and safety and the environment protection along the
supply chain.
