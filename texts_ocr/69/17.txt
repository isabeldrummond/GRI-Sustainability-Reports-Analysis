SOL GROUP - GOVERNANCE SYSTEM

 

GOVERNANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY

On 28 November 2016 the Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) Committee was set up with the
Directors, General Managers and Central Managers
appointed as its members.

The CSR Committee validates the sustainability goals
and coordinates and stimulates the operating struc-
tures of all of the Group companies.

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

The SOL Group has chosen to organise its Quality,
Safety and Environmental management system in
an integrated way in order to guarantee coverage of
all its activities, eliminating pointless duplications and
emphasising synergies.

The governance of the management _ sys-
tems is entrusted to the Quality, Safety and
Environmental Management System Steering
Committee (Comitato Guida Sistema di Gestione
Qualita, Sicurezza e Ambiente, CGSQ) made up of the
Directors, General Managers and Central Managers.
This has the task of reviewing the management sys-
tem to ensure its efficacy and suitability over time.

In operational terms, the management systems
fall under the responsibility of Quality, Safety and
Environmental Central Management, Regulatory
Affairs (DIQS), which reports annually to the CGSQ.

The DIQS presents its progress and any updates to
the Directors and Central Managers at quarterly
report meetings and the investment summit.

Matters relating to organisation, labour and indus-
trial relations are handled by Personnel and Legal
Affairs Central Management, which presents human
resources management data annually to the CEOs
and General Managers.

The management system is founded on the Policies,
documents approved by the Chairman and General
Managers of the Group that outline the principles
behind the operations of the Group companies and
define the objectives that the top management
intends to pursue in the various business areas.

In 2017 the SOL Group updated its management
systems to bring them into line with the new ISO
9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 13485:2016
standards.

RESPONSIBLE CARE

In 1995 SOL Spa was one of the first companies in
Italy to subscribe to Responsible Care, the voluntary
programme of the world chemical industry supported,
in Italy, by Federchimica, in which it plays an active
part, with its own representative on the managing
Committee.

As part of this programme, several environmental and
workplace safety performance indicators are collected
each year, which are also used in this report.

On 7 January 2015 SOL signed up to the “Responsible
Care Global Charter”, thus pledging to promote the
principles and content of the initiative in all countries
where the Group is present.

On 23 April 2015 subsidiary Flosit also signed up
to the programme, promoted in Morocco by the
“Federation de la Chimie et de la Parachimie”.

The implementation of the “Responsible care”
Programme at SOL Spa was subject, in 2017, to
an “Audit of the testing model established by
Federchimica’. This audit confirmed compliance with
the principles and requirements of the Programme.

RISK ANALYSIS

chain, as well as its commercial relations, are exposed
