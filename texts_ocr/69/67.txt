 

SOL GROUP - PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY

EIGA AWARD FOR BTG

BIG, a Belgian Group company with head office in
Lessines, was awarded the Peter J. Jackson Award by
the European Industrial Gases Association (EIGA) for
its safety performances in 2017.

Created in honour of Peter J. Jackson, former chair-
man of the EIGA Safety Advisor Group, the award is
presented to the EIGA member company that pro-
duced the best results in terms of reducing workplace
accident rates over a 5-year period.

 

When collecting the award, Andrea Sinigaglia, head
of BTG, outlined the key principles that have enabled
the company to achieve the goal of zero absences
due to accidents since 2012: the understanding that
safety comes before everything else, an understand-
ing of the risks and constant communications at all
levels, training and education, and the reduction of
stress in the workplace.

COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY

The SOL Group has always supported bodies, institu-
tions, associations and sports clubs that operate in
harmony with its values, making financial contribu-
tions and offering them the benefit of its expertise.

In 2017 the Group took part in Cinema d’Impresa,
a competition organised by Assolombarda aimed at
young film directors from important Italian schools
and universities (ALMED of Cattolica del Sacro Cuore
University, Istituto Europeo di Design, Libera Univer-
sita di Lingue e Comunicazione, Nuova Accademia
di Belle Arti, Department of Design of Milan Poly-
technic). For the 2017 edition competing directors
shot videos that tried to represent the relationship
between businesses and the environment, sustaina-
bility and the future.

The SOL Group is one of the partner companies of the
ISTUD Foundation, the first independent business
school in Italy that operates in the field of higher
education and management research, with whom it
organised various training activities. In addition, for
several years the Group has hosted a training day for
students from the ISTUD “Scientists in the company”
Master's course, offering the benefit of the experience

and skills of its resources who illustrate the Group's
activities in the medical-biological and pharmaceuti-
cal sectors to the students.

SOL is also partner of the Collége des Ingénieurs
Italia (formerly the Scuola di Alta Formazione Man-
ageriale) of Turin and supports the Master’s courses
of some participants, guaranteeing them a six-month
work experience with a view to eventually being hired
by the company.

In Italy, SOL is a sponsor and partner of Progetto
SLAncio, a project promoted by the La Meridiana
Cooperative of Monza, which provides assistance to
those suffering from invalidating neurological and
neuromuscular illnesses.

Vivisol actively supports research by financing
research fellowships and study grants (for example
at the University of Catania and the Ospedale degli
Infermi of Biella), as well as research programmes
(like the research programme on patients subject to
non-invasive ventilation, the study on the develop-
ment and validation of the beliefs about ventilation
questionnaire).
