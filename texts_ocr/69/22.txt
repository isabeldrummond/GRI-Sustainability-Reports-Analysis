Because of the kind of gases they produce and the
quantities they stock, 21 Group plants fall into the
field of application of Directive 2012/18/EU (“Seveso
Directive”).

They are the Italian units in Piombino, Mantua, Cre-
mona, Cuneo, Salerno, Ancona, Marcianise, Verona,
Pisa, Bari and Augusta, as well as those in Feluy (Bel-
gium), Frankfurt, Gersthofen and Krefeld (Germany),
Cergy Pontoise and Saint Savin (France), Tilburg (The
Netherlands), Jesenice (Slovenia), Devnya (Bulgaria)
and Cork (Ireland).

Directive 2012/18/EC makes it obligatory to adopt a
specific safety management system (which has much
in common with the provisions of OHSAS 18001),
and, therefore, to be periodically subjected to controls

by the Authorities (three during 2017, all with positive
outcomes).

Some Units of SOL Spa and SGP Srl fall into the
field of application of European Directive no. 75 of
24/11/2010, “Industrial Emission Directive” (IED),
which extends the scope of application of the IPPC
(Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control) regula-
tions and governs the granting, renewal and review of
Integrated Environmental Authorisation.

The company has authorisation for its hydrogen
(Ravenna), nitrous oxide (Cremona, Marcianise and
Tilburg) and acetylene (Ancona) production plants.
