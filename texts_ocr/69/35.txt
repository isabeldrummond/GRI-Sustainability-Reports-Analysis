VIVISOL CONTINUES TO PROMOTE
INNOVATION WITH RESMON PRO DIARY

Vivisol supported Restech S.rl., a Milan Polytechnic
spin off, in the development and production of
Resmon PRO Diary, an innovative system for the
remote management of patients afflicted with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Resmon PRO Diary is the first medical device that
is able to anticipate the exacerbation of COPD
through domestic monitoring thanks to an inno-
vative automatic algorithm that analyses respira-
tory parameters.

Resmon PRO Diary makes it possible to improve the
quality of life of patients in a simple and immediate
way: all they need to do is breathe into the device
for a minute a day and this, through the Vivisol tele-
medicine platform, automatically sends the data to
the patient’s doctor, communicating the possible

 

exacerbation of the disease. The doctor is therefore
able to take prompt action, adjusting the treatment
and thus preventing the patient's condition from
worsening.

The device and its algorithm were tested between
2013 and 2016 in a multicentre clinical trial that
demonstrated the efficacy of the monitoring action
with an significant reduction in the rate of hospital-
isation of patients and a consequent reduction in
costs for the health system.

Resmon PRO Diary was presented during the most
important European pulmonology congress, organ-
ised by the European Respiratory Society and held
in Milan on 9 - 13 September 2017.
