SOL GROUP - GLOSSARY

Medical device (MD): any instrument,
apparatus, equipment, machine, device, plant,
reagent in vitro or for calibration, computer
software, material or other similar or related
product for use, alone or in culmination, on
persons for one or more specific purposes

of diagnosis, prevention, control, therapy or
attenuation of an illness; for diagnosis, control,
therapy, attenuation or compensation of a
wound or handicap; for studying, substituting
or modifying anatomy or a physiological
process; for intervening on conception where
the main desired action in or on the human
body is not carried out with pharmacological or
immunological means or through metabolism,

but whose function can be aided by these means.

Medical gas: any medication consisting of one
or more active gaseous substances that may or
may not be mixed with excipient gases.

Mobile container: container for compressed,
liquid, dissolved and cryogenic gases used for
transporting products. Mobile containers are:
cylinders, drums, gas cylinders, cylinder bundles,
dewars, base units and portable units.

Policy (quality, safety, environment): general
principles and guidelines of an organisation,
formerly expressed by top management.

Primary process units: units where gases are
produced from raw materials.

Primary storage: liquefied cryogenic gas
container filled directly by the production plant.
Quality, safety and environmental management
system.

Quality, Safety and Environment
Management System (SHEQ/MS): that

part of the general management system that
includes the organisational structure, planning,
responsibilities, procedures, processes and
resources for drawing up, implementing and
maintaining active well-defined quality, safety
and/or environmental policies.

Raw materials — primary process units:
atmospheric air, for the production of oxygen,
nitrogen and argon; natural gas, for the
production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide;
calcium carbide for the production of acetylene;
ammonium nitrate for the production of nitrous
oxide.

REACh: EC regulation n. 1907/2006
(Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and
Restriction of Chemicals). Its main aim is to
improve the awareness of the dangers and risks
deriving from chemical substances, aiming to
attain a high level of protection of human health
and the environment.

Residual mix: refers to the average primary
energy sources that were not intended for

a specific entity or to an end consumer. If a
consumer uses the power grid without having
purchased a GO certificate, he then has to use

the residual mix in the calculation of its footprint.

The Residual mix is calculated for each year and
country by organizations that are part of the
European E-Track programme, such as RE-DISS.

Responsible Care: a voluntary program of

the world chemical industry based on the
implementation of principles and conduct
concerning the safety and health of employees
and environmental protection, and the
commitment to communicate the results
obtained aiming for continual, significant and
tangible improvement.

Sale equipment: technical/technological
equipment purchased from third parties and

supplied for use to customers as part of a service,

but destined to remain the property of SOL; for
example mobile containers, cold converters etc.

Secondary process units: units where gases
are conditioned, normally using gases coming
from primary process units, into their physical
form (which may be compressed gas or
cryogenic liquid) in the containers (cylinders,
cylinder bundles, drums or tanks) best suited
for distribution to end users. Some units also
produce pure and high purity gas mixtures.

87

Secondary storage: liquefied cryogenic gas
container filled by tankers, normally installed in
secondary process units.

Severity index: ratio between days of absence
due to injury and hours worked multiplied by 1
million. It measures the severity of injuries.

Seveso Directive (2012/18/EU and later
modifications): European regulation aimed
at preventing and controlling the risk of serious
accidents. It governs industrial activities that
involve the stocking and/or use of certain
quantities of dangerous substances.

Stakeholder: all categories of subjects, private
or public, individual or collective, internal or
external, that can influence the success of

a business or whose interests are involved

in business decisions: customers, suppliers,
investors, local communities, employees, unions,
public administration, future generations etc.

Steam reforming: process in which methane
reacts with steam, in the presence of a catalyst,
to produce hydrogen and CO,.

Sustainability (see Sustainable development)

Sustainable development: development that

can satisfy current economic, environmental and
social needs, without compromising the chances
of future generations being able to satisfy theirs.
