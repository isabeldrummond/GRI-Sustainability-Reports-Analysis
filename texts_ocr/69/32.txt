SOL GROUP - CUSTOMERS, PATIENTS AND SUPPLIERS

AN INTEGRATED SERVICE FOR
THE MANAGEMENT OF AMBULANCES

Thanks to the presence within the Group of com-
panies specialising in sanitisation and the testing
of electromedical equipment, SOL has been able to
design an integrated service for the management
of ambulances, the first point of contact between
the patient and the hospital. This was also possible
thanks to the experience the Group has acquired by
providing its services to the various institutions that
operate in this area.

When designing the service, the priority was guar-
anteeing the safety of patients and healthcare
workers.

In particular, the integrated service involves checks
on the mobile Medical Oxygen distribution device

WAANTA ANWAR

ASWVAIVAM

and Vacuum aspiration system to ensure they are
undamaged and functioning correctly, checks on
the electrical safety and correct functioning of elec-
tromedical equipment (defibrillator, ECG, medical
ventilator, infusion pump) and the sanitisation of
the entire mobile unit using hydrogen peroxide.

SOL also organises training sessions for healthcare
workers on the correct management of the medical
gas supply system, cylinders and apparatus on board
the emergency vehicle.

In 2017 SOL signed an agreement for the supply
of the first ambulances to Azienda Provinciale per i
Servizi Sanitari, the regional healthcare provider in the
Autonomous Province of Trento.
