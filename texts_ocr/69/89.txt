For several years now, the Sustainability Report has been a key instrument for keeping all of our stakeholders up
to date on the commitments we have made and the initiatives we have carried out.

the information published or, in particular, through their daily commitment to translating the values shared by
the SOL Group people into appropriate behaviour.
