SOL GROUP - GOVERNANCE SYSTEM

The risk analysis is complemented by the assessment
made in compliance with the requirements of laws,
technical standards and best practice guidelines
applicable, for instance, to drugs, medical devices,
foods and pressure equipment.

CERTIFICATION

The SOL Group launched the certification process for
its Units in 1994.

The main Italian sites were first certified according to
ISO 9001 and other standards have gradually been
implemented in relation to Group activities. The
perimeter was then extended to other locations and
other countries.

ISO 9001: starting from the certification of the first
Units in 1994, the Group has subsequently extended
the perimeter. Today this certification covers 119
units in the various European countries (114 in 2016).

OHSAS 18001: this certification becomes even more
important, as a guarantee for the top management,
with the entry into force in Italy of Legislative Decree
no. 81/2008, which establishes the adoption of a
Management system in line with the OHSAS 18001
standard as a necessary condition for being exempted
from the application of the sanctions established by
Decree no. 231/2001.

SOL Spa and Vivisol Srl certified the Safety Management
Systems for all their Units in accordance with the
OHSAS 18001 standard. The certified Italian Units

were later joined by other Units in Albania, Bulgaria,
Romania, the Netherlands, the UK, Slovenia and
Spain.

ISO 14001 and EMAS: considering the importance
attached to respecting environmental issues, even
though the Group’s production activities have a lim-
ited direct impact on the environment, the correct
adoption of the Group Management System was
verified with the certification of some particularly
significant Units. Currently, 25 Units have ISO 14001
certification or EMAS registration, four more than in
2017 (TGP, ReNi., Sterimed and SPG).

Two Italian Units and one Slovenian Unit have also
obtained EMAS Registration for their environmental
management systems.

ISO 50001: the sites of SOL Spa's Branch Deutschland
and SOL Kohlensdure in Germany and those of
Slovenian companies SPG and TPJ have ISO 50001
certification. ISO 50001 is an international standard
whose adoption helps organisations improve their
performances in the energy sector, increasing their
efficiency and reducing their impact on the climate
and the environment.

ISO 27001: the ISO 27001 standard defines the
requirements for establishing and managing an
Information Security Management System (logical,
physical and organisational security), with the aim
of protecting data and information from all kinds of
threats, guaranteeing their integrity, confidentiality
and availability.
