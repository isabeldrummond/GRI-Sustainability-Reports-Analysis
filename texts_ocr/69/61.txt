SOL GROUP - PEOPLE AND THE COMMUNITY

PROTECTING DIVERSITY

In the area of safeguarding equal opportunities, the
SOL Group intends to combat all forms of discrim-
ination, whether this is based on physical condition,
disability, opinions, nationality, ethnic group, religion,
gender, sexual orientation or gender identity.

The progressive extension of our activities in new
countries requires us to pay increasing attention to
the national and cultural differences present within

the Group companies. The SOL Group's aim is to pro-
mote local resources at all levels of the organisation,
giving priority to local managers and assigning con-
trol and monitoring tasks to central functions.

Of some significance is the fact that, when the top
company positions were reviewed, the number of
women who sit on the Board of Directors of parent
company SOL Spa rose from four to five, representing
50% of the 10 members.

INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS
AND ENGAGEMENT

The SOL Group's desire to engage and inform all of its
people is manifest in its adoption of various internal
communication tools: company house organ SOL
News, the intranet, the Sustainability Report. SOL
News was redesigned in 2017 to become a newslet-
ter that could reach out to the entire company
population. Thanks to the circulation of this publica-
tion, all employees can keep up to date on the Group's
main initiatives throughout the year.

During last two years some of the Group companies
(Vivisol in Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany)
carried out engagement surveys with the aim of
assessing the strengths of the organisational engage-
ment and where it can be improved. The results of
the survey were analysed and communicated to the
employees involved, and specific internal meetings
were held to assess the data and define any necessary
improvement actions.
