SOL GROUP: 90 YEARS OF HISTORY
AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

This is the 9th edition of the SOL Group Sustainability Report.

This year we celebrate the 90th anniversary of our company, which was founded in 1927 by Giovanni Annoni
and Aldo Fumagalli Romario and a number of other partners from Monza. With a turnover of € 757 million
euros in 2017, SOL has grown consistently over the last 90 years thanks to the work of its 3,556 employees in its
100-plus plants and sites in 28 countries across the world.

Over the years SOL has constantly sought to achieve harmonious development compatible with the needs
of the environment through the correct management of resources. SOL's primary goal has always been the
safety of its employees, customers and products. Finally, every day SOL seeks to fulfll its social responsibility to
the communities that host it, offering them development and employment opportunities in return.

Italian Legislative Decree no. 254/2016 has established that listed companies must draft a non-financial state-
ment as of this year. SOL has already met this obligation for some time by drafting its own Sustainability Report.
The 2017 Report seeks to improve on past editions in terms of comprehensiveness, clarity and interest for all
readers; for the first time Deloitte & Touche Spa carried out a limited assurance engagement on the document.

In 2017 the SOL Group focused specific attention on the themes of the Code of Ethics and the Antitrust
regulation. In particular, the SOL Spa Board of Directors issued a new, more complete version of the Group
Code of Ethics and extensive efforts were made to increase the awareness of the Code and its contents among
all Group employees at all sites, in Italy and abroad, so it can be comprehensively and accurately implemented
across the board.

In terms of the Antitrust regulation, an “Antitrust Compliance” programme was launched. More specifically, the
SOL Spa Board of Directors drafted and introduced an Antitrust Code with an operating handbook, documents
that were disseminated in both Italian and English on the company network. Specific informative and in-depth
programmes are ongoing in all of the Group companies, in Italy and abroad.

In terms of the development of the business's operations, 2017 was notable for an important series of
acquisitions. In the area of home care services, the Group acquired Swiss company Sitex of Geneva which
specialises in palliative care, with highly qualified nurses, and is able to produce specific prescription drugs for its
patients internally. During the year the Group also acquired a majority interest in Irish company Direct Medical,
opening up new business opportunities for itself in the Irish market. At the end of 2017 it acquired the stakes of
the minority shareholders in Turkish company Vivisol TK, which was then merged with Turkish company Respitek
to create Vivisol Turkey, of which the SOL Group is the majority shareholder, with Turkish partners active and
expert in the promising local respiratory care sector.
