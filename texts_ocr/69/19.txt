FEDERCHIMICA AWARDS
SOL FOR ITS BIOMETHER PROJECT

In 2017 SOL won the Responsible Care award for
the BioMethER project, developed in collaboration
with Aster, the Region of Emilia-Romagna, CRPA Lab,
IREN, IREN Rinnovabili, IRETI and HERAmbiente.

Financed by the European Commission LIFE+
programme and co-funded by the Region of Emil-
ia-Romagna, the project was developed by the SOL
Technical and Testing Department and involves the
creation of two pilot plants for the production of
biomethane destined to be fed directly into the grid
or used as transport fuel.

 

The biomethane is produced by purifying biogas, a
process known as “upgrading”. The upgrading pro-
cess removes undesirable components and makes it
possible to obtain a gas with a methane content of
95% or higher.

Of the two pilot plants involved in the project, the
first plant to be developed is at the treatment plant
in Roncocesi, a district in the Municipality of Reggio
Emilia. The pilot plant uses around 250,000-300,000
m®? of biogas every year, which was previously burnt
off using flares. The project makes it possible to pro-
duce around 140,000 m? of biomethane every year,
the equivalent consumption of 150 methane-fuelled
cars travelling an average of 15,000 km a year, avoid-
ing the emission of around 340 tonnes of CO,

The project is an important example of the circular
economy as it makes a resource out of a product that
until yesterday was regarded as waste.

A new phase of the project was launched in 2017
with the arrival of ENEA and Volkswagen. Produced
in Roncocesi, the biomethane will be used to fuel
two cars made available by Volkswagen Italia, filled
using an ENEA pump and used by IREN employees.
The monitoring of the performances of these vehi-
cles compared with those of the same model when
fuelled using fossil methane will make it possible to
assess the impact of the two different forms of fuel
on the wear and tear of the engine.
