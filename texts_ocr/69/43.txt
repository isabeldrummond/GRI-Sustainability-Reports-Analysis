SOL GROUP - CUSTOMERS, PATIENTS AND SUPPLIERS

Patients with chronic conditions such as sleep apnoea
or respiratory insufficiency can rely on home care
services which, conditions permitting, enable them to
enjoy lives of the highest possible quality and inde-
pendence, avoiding hospitalisation.

GENOMIC DIAGNOSTICS

There are several advantages of genomic diagnostics

which the Group makes available to its customers:

e Prevention: by performing tests on a healthy
population the probability of being able to take
prompt action to prevent some illnesses is higher.

¢ Early identification of problems: by screening
new-born babies and carrying out predictive tests
on a population that is at high risk of a specific ill-
ness it is possible to identify anomalies in advance
and, potentially, take early action.

e Assistance for the ill: by identifying DNA muta-
tions it is possible to modulate personalised tre-
atments to improve the effectiveness of healthcare.

SAFE PRODUCT MANAGEMENT

The safety of products is monitored both in the
production phase and during transportation, right
through until they are used by customers, using risk
assessment processes.

The SOL Group takes part in national and interna-
tional working groups on product safety matters in
order to stay constantly updated on the evolution of
regulations and to be able to operate in harmony with
other companies in the sector.

The management of the Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
of all substances and for all companies operating in
the European Community is centralised at the Monza
headquarters. There are currently around 4,000 avai-
lable SDS in 19 languages. All of the sheets and all
of the labels applied to mobile containers conform
to Regulation 1272/2008 (CLP - Classification, Label-
ling and Packaging), which regards the European
standardisation of the classification and labelling of
hazardous substances and preparations.

As regards REACh (Regulation on Registration, Eva-
luation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals),
the process of registering the substances marketed by
SOL will be completed in 2018.

Product traceability - and particularly that of medi-
cal gas containers which require the implementation
of a pharmaceutical vigilance system - provides infor-
mation on the location of products at all times, also
permitting prompt withdrawal actions in the event of
problems with the delivered products.
