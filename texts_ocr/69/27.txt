Carbonic fertilisation with CO,; increase in
production and in quality and look of the
product

Fumigation and pest control with CO, of
biological agricultural products for which
no chemical products, such as phosphine,
can be used

Fish and mussle farming with O,: increase
in production and quality of the finished
product.

Cooling, flash freezing, cryogenic freezing,
IQF with Lin o LCO,: improved quality

of frozen product, taste characteristics
maintained, better aesthetic aspect,
reduced freezing times and space saving.
Packaging in atmosphere modified with N,
and CO, shelf life optimisation, improved
aesthetic aspect, freshness maintained
Transport at temperature controlled with
Lin or dry ice: safeguarding of freezing
chain to preserve quality of food and avoid
spread of bacteria

Gassing, pressing with nitrogen, water
dosage: plastic bottle weight reduction.

Tools

Controlled protective and reactive
atmospheres with nitrogen and hydrogen
Endothermic and exothermic atmospheres
with solmix controlled carbon potential
Keying with Lin: products made not using
heat but cold, limiting fuel consumption.
Lin soldering of electronic cards: reduced
waste and manual elimination of defective
cards, increasing production quality
Cutting and laser welding with nitrogen
and oxygen: increased productivity and
product quality

Oxy cutting and oxyacetylene welding,
Mig/Mag, Tig and plasma welding and
welders.

Gas distribution automation and plant:
reduced manual operations help reduce
risk of accidents

Pressure & fugitive tests with helium

and nitrogen: guarantees tightness of
components treated, reducing risks of
leakage of products, also toxic products,
from plant where they are used (e.g.
offshore oil wellhead valves).
