SOL GROUP - THE ENVIRONMENT

ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION

(MWh)

 

The SOL Group’s emissions can be separated into:
e direct emissions from its production plants;

e indirect emissions deriving from the consump-
tion of electricity by the primary production plants;
¢ emissions connected with deliveries to custom-

ers and patients.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

 

Direct emissions

The direct emission of greenhouse gases is made up of:

e carbon dioxide: a by-product in plants producing
hydrogen through the steam reforming of meth-
ane, emitted from wells in plants producing CO, or
vented during the dry ice production process;

e nitrous oxide: emitted from plants producing N,O
from ammonium nitrate;

e HFC (hydrofluorocarbons): used in plant refrigera-
tion circuits.
