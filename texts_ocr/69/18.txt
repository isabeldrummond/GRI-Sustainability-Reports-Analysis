Group's main stakeholders, was an integral part of the
analysis.

The main risks regarding non-financial matters to

which the Group is exposed are attributable to:

e environmental matters: potential risks related
to electricity consumption of the Group’s primary
transformation plants, potential risks related to
direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions,

particular reference to road transport.

e social matters: potential risks related to com-
pliance with existing regulations regarding infor-
mation to customers and patients, potential risks
related to the supply of products and services that
address customers’ needs, potential risks linked
to the traceability of the origin of products and
services, potential risks regarding the suppliers of
services of home care sector and in general the
management of social and environmental risks
along the supply chain, potential risks regarding
the failure to respect human rights, with particular
reference to the supply chain.

¢ employees’ related matters: potential risks
related to employees’ health and safety and to
compliance with legislation concerning occupa-
tional health and safety.

¢ compliance with laws and regulations: poten-
tial risks related to non compliance with laws and
regulations, including bribery and corruption.

Given the abovementioned potential risks, the Group
has assessed the existing internal control system for
the different activities, possible gap to be filled and
related measures to improve internal controls.

The company function that oversees the main envi-
ronmental and health and safety risks is repre-
sented by Company Managers, under the oversight of
the Quality, Safety and Environment, Regulatory
Affairs central Department.

The same Company Managers, supported by any
local or corporate designated functions, also oversee
the risks related to employees’ management and the

issues covered by the Code of Ethics. The Code of
Ethics applies to all those who, in various way, come
into contact with the Group, including suppliers, part-
ners, customers. The Code includes, among others,
provisions regarding the protection of safety, health
and environment, human rights respect and preven-
tion and fight of corruption.

The Group has activated processes and manage-
ment systems in order to mitigate the most rel-
evant risks, so as to guarantee the correct control of
the matters. In particular, the Group’s most significate
units have obtained certification such as ISO 9001,
OHSAS 18001, ISO 14001, ISO 50001, ISO 13485,
ISO 27001, ISO 22000. During 2017, the SOL Group
progressively updated its quality and environmental
management systems, respectively to the new ISO
9001:2015, ISO 13485:2016 e ISO 14001:2015
standards. This entailed the start of a process of anal-
ysis of company activities in order to identify risks and
assess opportunities related to business processes.
The analysis took into account the sustainability
issues that are relevant to the SOL Group, in particular
the risks potentially present in product making phases
and service delivery, as well as in business relation-
ships. The assessment was extended, where relevant,
to the supply chain.
