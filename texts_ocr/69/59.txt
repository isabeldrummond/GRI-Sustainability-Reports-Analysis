HR POLICIES

HR management policies were defined and dissem-
inated with the aim of adopting the same approach
across the Group and to spread the common conduct
principles of each Group company. These are the val-
ues that must inspire employees in the management
of interpersonal relations, in the search, recruitment,
training and development of staff, and in their
assessment.

 

In 2017 the existing policies were joined by the Social
Media Policy, a document designed to encourage
SOL Group employees to use the social media in an
informed and responsible way in order to protect the
privacy, image and reputation of the Group.
