© The direct emissions related to 2017 include emission data from the production of dry ice, which is not available for previous years. The emissions from
company cars are not currently available. The emissions related to the transport of products using Group's vehicles are reported in more detail in the indirect

emissions from product deliveries.

Direct emissions related to 2016 have been recalculated following a more accurate data collection process.
3) With regards to home care, the kilometers travelled have been estimated considering the number of patients.

In 2017 it was also possible to measure CO, emissions
connected with the production of dry ice (around
10,500 tonnes). Excluding these, the remaining emis-
sions are slightly higher than those of last year.

In 2017, as in 2016, no extraordinary maintenance
was necessary on plant refrigeration units and, conse-
quently, the emissions connected with HFCs were not
significant.

Indirect emissions

Starting with an analysis of the energy supply mix we
evaluated the indirect emissions generated by the
production of the electricity used by the SOL Group.
These emissions came to around 256,467 tonnes of
CO,, higher than in 2016 due to the opening of
the Augusta site.

Emissions from deliveries to customers and
patients

In 2016, the monitoring of emissions as a result of
delivery activities was extended to all product types:

e products in tankers and tube trailers;
¢ products in mobile containers;
e home care products.

Attention to transport is of fundamental impor-
tance as regards environmental and safety aspects.

Products are distributed mainly by road and to an
extremely widespread customer base.

The chemical and physical characteristics of the main
products also make it necessary to use special vehi-
cles for transportation (heavily insulated tankers for
cryogenic liquids) or special containers (cylinders for
compressed gases and base units for liquid oxygen
for home care use). In both cases, the unfavourable
ratio between the tare weight and the weight of the
transported products results in a low level of fuel con-
sumption efficiency per product unit sold.

Bearing these restrictions in mind, the SOL Group's
actions to reduce fuel consumption and therefore its
environmental impact have consisted of:
