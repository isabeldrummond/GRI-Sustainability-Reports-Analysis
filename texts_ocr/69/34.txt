tance service.

pendently again leads to a real improvement in the patient's

terises the evolution of Vivisol’s activities in patient home
care. Through the selection and development of the most
advanced communication technologies, it is possible to
reduce times and distances, enabling doctors to monitor
patients at home with a level of effectiveness and imme-
diacy comparable to hospital care.
