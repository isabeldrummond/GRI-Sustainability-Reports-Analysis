SGD 17: Goal 17 - Partnership for the goals - is considered a cross-cutting goal
and for this reason is not evaluated with a dedicated module. The progress of
the international community in terms of strategic partnership is measured in the
tool by various questions in the modules of the remaining 16 objectives.

The absence of a specific result related to SDG 17 should not give us a tinted
perception of the goal, whose development is not secondary at all, but contri-
butes, instead, to the achievement of all of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda.
The SDG 17 “partnerships for the goals” includes all of Chiesi’s commitments
to involve suppliers in the contribution to the SDGs. The same commitment is

evaluated in the application of the other 16 modules.

3.An overall evaluation of our performance on the 17 SDGs

SDG1 QD 21.10%

SDG 2 QUID 12.10%

SOG 3 QD 74.1:
SDG 4 QD 12.20%

SDC5 QD 25.10%

SDG 6 QUID 16.90%

SDG7 @§ 410%

SDC 8 QD 25.00%

SDC 9 QD 27.50.

SDG 10 QD 17.70%

SOG 11 QD 3s.1%
SDG 12 QD 20°.

SDC 13 QD 14.5%

SDG 14 QB 7.80%

SDG 15 GD 10.10%

SDC 16 QD 30.80%

The results show that the company contributes 74.1% to SDG No. 3 - Good He-
alth and Well-being - which is the highest percentage among those assessed.
This means that the tool recognises our business model as fully oriented to the
promotion of Good Health and Well-being.

Our commitment to SDG 3 focuses particularly on the following defined targets:

— Target 3.2 By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years
of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12

per 1,000 live births and under 5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births

— Target 3.4 By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communi-
cable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and

well being
