Highlights

We care for our communities. With our skills and resources, we want to
contribute to the development of the communities we live in, to do our
part in promoting long-term, integrated and sustainable growth.
Sustainability, to us, means to recognising the strong interdependence
between a business and the system in which a company operates, in-
cluding the local community: the success of the former is inextricably
linked to the prosperity of the latter, and vice versa.

Our intent is to promote the local community's social, cultural, environmen-
tal and economic development, generating shared value, because the mere
adherence to legal requirements and accountability cannot be enough. To
make a difference, we need to go back to caring and therefore doing as
much good as we can.
