e We improved our energetic perfor-
mance. Chiesi implemented an ener-
gy management system that gives
continuity, with a focus on continuo-
us improvement, to the energy audit
carried out in 2019 for our manu-
facturing plants and research centre
in Parma. This is more than a mere
calculation of the energy performan-
ce. The output and documentation
of the project will be the basis for
future certification according to the
ISO 50001 standard. In addition, we
adopted a purchase policy that fa-
vours green energy from certified re-
newable sources. We involved all of

our affiliates and manufacturing si-

tes in the efficiency and optimisation
processes, including energy review
methods, energy metering installa-
tion, and partner selection approach.
We are pursuing the LEED Gold cer-
tification for our new Headquarters
building and we are going to pursue
this certification processes for 3 ad-
ditional sites.

At our production sites, R&D centres,
and commercial affiliates, the main
energy resources used are electricity,
natural gas, and diesel. In 2019, the
Group's energy consumption decrea-
sed by 2.4% compared to 2018, mainly
due to a reduction in fossil fuel consu-

mption (diesel and natural gas).

497,103 GJ of Energy consumption in 2019 — reduced by 2.4% compared to 2018
