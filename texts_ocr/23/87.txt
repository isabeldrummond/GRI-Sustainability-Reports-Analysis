Highlights

We live in times of major upheavals. We are now facing the consequen-
ces of human action, and we have the urge to change the way we relate to
people and the planet. Political agendas must be steered in this direction.
Healthcare economics is a complex intersection of regulatory aspects, institutional
agendas, patientsâ€™ association objectives, advocacy groups campaigns, and overall
knowledge on specific health problems. In this scenario, our role as a business,
guided by the B Corp principle of interdependence, is crucial: contributing to the
advancement of the regulatory frameworks in the countries we operate, to enhance

the quality of life of our patients, with complete transparency.
