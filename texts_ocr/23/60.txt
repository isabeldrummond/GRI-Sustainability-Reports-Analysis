e We are on our way to becoming a
Great Place to Work.

Great Place to Work® is a leader in
the analysis of a company’s work cul-
ture which compares the employees’
perception about their work environ-
ment with HR management policies.
Chiesi was awarded the certification
according to the Trust Index and Cul-
ture Audit results in Austria, Brazil,
France, Germany, Mexico, the Nether-
lands, Spain, Sweden, UK and the US,
and is currently working to extend it.
4,932 employees were surveyed (90%
of total employees) around three key
areas: relationship with manage-
ment, good relations with colleagues
and pride in their work. 4,403 people
answered globally, representing an
89% response rate. They confirmed a
high level of fairness related to diver-
sity, credibility, respect and, above all,
pride to work for Chiesi. 76% of em-
ployees recognise Chiesi as a great
place to work.

Chiesi was certified as a Top Em-
ployer and Top Employer Europe
— the title assigned to companies
that achieve certification in at least
5 European countries — in 11 diffe-
rent countries. In particular, Italy was
awarded the title for the 12th year
running, whereas France, Germany,
the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and
the UK have confirmed Chiesi as Top
Employer Europe for the 8th conse-
cutive year. Non-European countries
whose certification has also been re-

newed are Brazil, the USA and Russia.

e We have created the Diversity & In-
clusion Committee.

We aim to apply best practices for
diversity and inclusion to ensure

employee retention, motivation and

equity in general. We saw that incre-
ased diversity and inclusion contri-
butes to productivity, creativity and a
company’s ability to innovate. Ultima-
tely, this contributes to the happiness
and success of all employees.

This international committee addres-
ses 4 main areas: disability, gender
diversity, diversity among genera-
tions and cultural diversity. Our main
goal for 2019 was to raise awareness
around the topics and to set a plan
for 2020. We collected key informa-
tion on the expectations, stereotypes,
advantaged and disadvantaged cate-
gories in Chiesi and we identified the
needs for future action.

At the end of 2019, Chiesi received
the “Diversity Leaders Award 2020”,
promoted by the Financial Times.
Chiesi was included among the first
70 European companies which work
to promote the concept of diversity.
Chiesi was ranked 1st of the 8 Italian

companies.

e We have introduced 1 day a week
smart working.

This allows more flexibility and im-
proved quality of private life which
in turn increases people's efficiency,
confirming the relationship between

work-life balance and productivity.

e We have created a group of local
and international mentors.

We are committed to helping our pe-
ople across the globe, starting with
new hires, to grow, discovering new
understanding, acquiring abilities,
and changing perspectives. Mento-
ring is a wise and rich use of existing
knowledge and resources, accelera-
ting the transition of people into new

professional roles. It improves un-
