The Struggles we are Facing

Broadening our _patient-centric ap-

 

roach requires a new value model.

 

As we want to directly engage pa-
tients in our research processes, we
need to organise a consistent and
structured plan involving them from
the early phases through the co-crea-
tion of therapeutic solutions, but also
at the delivery stage through services
and support specifically designed for
them and their caregivers. Ensuring a
sustainable transition of this model

is a point of concern.

Patients’ needs may change over
time, and we must be able to foresee

them. Throughout the development of

 

a product, we need to become able to
foresee the changes that may occur in
patients’ needs.

The development of a drug can last
10-15 years. This is a very long time
during which the needs of the patients
may fluctuate. We need to develop the
capacity to predict the needs of the
people in order to keep innovations
relevant through time. In line with this
aim, we also started pioneering new
projects for timeline reduction throu-
gh process optimisation and multi-de-

partment task forces.

Governments, health care systems,
institutions, organisations and phar-
ma companies should work together
to improve quality of care, achieving
a balance in the system.

Increasing healthcare costs and the

needs of a growing and aging popula-

tion risk becoming an unsustainable
burden for governments who put
their population's health as a priority.
At the same time, drug development
is an increasingly expensive and rigid
process, with increasing develop-
ment time and risk which may result
unbearable for pharmaceutical com-
panies. All concerned actors should
find ways to work together in the inte-
rest of patients, identifying solutions
that bring equilibrium in this delicate

system.

We face the global challenge of a

scientific and technological revolu-
tion. In companies like ours, shaped
around Research and Development,
technology plays a pivotal role. Inno-
vations like virtual reality, augmented
reality, 3D, artificial intelligence and
simulations are powerful tools that
can radically change both the R&D
process and the patients experien-
ce. However, in order to be ready to
embrace technological change, we
need to broaden our knowledge and
ultimately rethink and restructure our

interaction with technology.
