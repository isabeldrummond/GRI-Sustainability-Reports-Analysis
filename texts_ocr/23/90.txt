Focus: Business Ethics and

Compliance

Chiesi is committed to encouragin

 

the highest level of respect, transpa-

rency and ethical behaviour in mana-
ging professional interactions among

 

all our employees and with our part-
ners and customers.

“Being a reliable company” is both a
core value and a motivating goal that
requires a deep commitment to ethi-
cal behaviour by all of our people. To
support this goal, in addition to what
is explained in the chapters above, we
have developed and adopted several
procedures and guidelines which set
out common requirements with whi-
ch all companies in the Group must
comply, beyond fulfilling the require-

ments of laws and regulations.

ian Competition Authority (AGCM).
Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. has been
awarded the maximum Legality Ra-
ting score of 3 stars by the Italian
Competition Authority (AGCM).

Organisational,
management and control
model

Over the past few years, we have
established tools and processes to
prevent, monitor and respond to any
cases of non-compliance. In 2003,
pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree
No. 231/2001, applicable across the
whole Italian territory, we adopted
an Organisational, Management and
Control Model (known as a “Model
231”) that clearly defines our ethical
commitments and responsibilities in

the conduct of our business activi-

ties. This Model 231 defines admini-
strative responsibilities and rules to
avoid unlawful behaviour and iden-
tifies the role and responsibilities of
the Surveillance Body"’. The latter is
entrusted with the power of super-
vising the correct application of the
Model itself and refers the outcomes
of such activity to the Board of Direc-
tors on a periodic basis.

The Model 231 includes the Code of
Ethics and Conduct, which expres-
ses the company's commitment to
operate in accordance, not only with
the laws and regulations currently in
force, but also with certain principles
and rules of ethical conduct. The
Code is binding on all bodies, em-
ployees, consultants, collaborators,
agents and, on a more general level,
all third parties acting on behalf of
the company.

In 2005, Chiesi adopted the Group
Code of Ethics and Conduct, which
at the time was implemented by our
main affiliates and, in 2010, was en-
dorsed by all Chiesi affiliates worl-
dwide. In addition, a number of Euro-
pean affiliates implemented internal
control systems shaped on legal re-
quirements similar to the Model 231.
The Model 231 is available to all
employees via intranet (C-Share). It
is subject to periodic review and re-
vision, and any change is promptly
communicated to all employees.

In 2012, we released our Group Guide-
lines on Ethics and Compliance, whi-
ch provides a common framework of
rules and aligns governance proces-

ses and systems, while ensuring that
