Chiesi’s baseline evaluation returns interesting results. The main takeaways are

summarised in the following points:

— Baseline 65.4%: our organisation shows a general well-rounded commit-
ment to the most relevant social and environmental global issues. A solid set
of processes and a structured organisation are already helping us in ensuring
a proactive focus on these matters. Nevertheless, we have identified additional

activities that we will consider in our improvement plans.

— Human Rights: the analysis shows the most room for improvement in the
Human Rights area. Our operations and facilities are located in areas where
human rights are generally granted and we did not feel the need to establish
extra control models. The analysis brought to our attention possible additional

measures that will ensure further protection of human rights over time.

2. Our progress in the 9 SDGs we are committed to
In addition to the baseline analysis, Chiesi’s performance was measured against

4 different sub-topics for each of the 9 SDGs we are committed to:

— Business Model: how Chiesi’s business model can contribute to each SDG;

— Internal Operations: how Chiesi can contribute to each SDG within itself;

— Supply Chain: how Chiesi manages its supply chain's contributions to each SDG;

— Collective Action: this section recognises the broader opportunities Chiesi
can engage in outside of the business model, operations, and supply chain to

contribute to each SDG.

Scoring System

Overall performance on a given SDG is reported as a percentage in order to provide a consistent
and comparable benchmark across all companies, as not all sub-topics are applicable to every
company. Performance on sub-topics are reported on a point-s based system in order to more
directly track progress and improvement over time. Sub-topics are equally weighted relative to one
another for each module. Each question has its own score value, which is viewable on the question
itself and the user earnssn credit for the positive practices it answers and improves upon.

Furthermore, when evaluating the company’s performance, it is important to consider how
business activities, practices, outcomes, and lack of information may be posing a risk to the
targets of an SDG, in addition to positive contributions. To assess this, each SDG-specific module
features a section focused on risk. This section does not assume actual negative impact, based

on the answers, and is scored through coloured flag ratings, as you can see below.
