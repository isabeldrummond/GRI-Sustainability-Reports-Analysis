Agency, but with 11 other authorities
from countries in which Chiesi is pre-
sent. Such arrangements will reward
Chiesi’s open approach with the bene-
fit of no tax audits, for the years 2017-
18, for the respective affiliates active in

those countries.

e We are transparent in the transfers
of value with Healthcare professionals
and organisations. Since 2015 (first pu-
blication 30 June 2016), in accordance
with the rules set forth within the Far-
mindustria (The Association of Phar-
maceutical Companies and a member
of Confindustria) Code of Conduct,
which implemented the EFPIA’s “Code
on the Disclosure of Transfers of Va-
lue from Pharmaceutical Companies
to Healthcare Professionals and Heal-
thcare Organisations”, we disclose any
transfers of value between Chiesi and
healthcare professionals and organi-
sations. This information can be found

on Chiesi’s websites.

e Risk Management: from _complian-
ce to business continuity. As a mul-
tinational company operating in the
pharmaceutical sector, we have a great
responsibility: our choices have a rele-
vant impact on the community, and we
must ensure the continuity of our ope-
rations in order to take care of our pa-
tients. This is why Risk Management is
also a key pillar of Chiesi’s strategy. We
follow a holistic approach in managing
the risks affecting the group and its sta-
keholders. In 2018, we started a path to
adopt an integrated risk management
system and unify the individual efforts
of the various departments.

With this in mind, the Enterprise Risk
Management function was created in

2019, reporting directly to the group's

CFO. An initial risk mapping with a top-
down approach was carried out, which
led to the identification of 36 specific ri-
sks, 16 of which were classified as top
risks and have undergone specific risk
monitoring activities. But we always
aim to improve, so this is why we have a
pipeline of activities for 2020 to enhan-
ce the synergies with all departments in

their risk management activities.

e Corporate Governance in Chiesi_is
exercised through various bodies, be-
ginning with our Board of Directors, and
the Board of Statutory Auditors. The lat-
ter has a duty to verify compliance with
the law and the company's by-laws, and
to ensure the adequacy and reliability
of our accounting system. Our cur-
rent Board of Directors consists of 7
members. Of these, 6 are male and 1
is female (86% and 14% respectively).
6 directors are over 50 years old and
account for 86% of the Board, while the
other 14% is represented by a member
between the ages of 30 and 50 years.
In order to ensure compliance with all
laws and regulations, Chiesi set up a
Corporate Compliance Committee,
which oversees the interpretation and
implementation of the Group's Gui-
delines on Ethics & Compliance, and
the Supervisory Body (Organismo di
Vigilanza), an independent committee
appointed directly by the Board of Di-
rectors. As a Benefit Corporation, since
2018 Chiesi has had an Impact Com-
mittee dedicated to the monitoring and
management of purposes of common
benefit. Beyond fulfilling the require-
ments of laws and regulations, we have
developed and adopted several pro-
cedures and guidelines which set out
common requirements with which all

companies in the Group must comply.
