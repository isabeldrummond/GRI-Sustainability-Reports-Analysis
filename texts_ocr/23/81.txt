e The Chiesi Foundation’s work aims
to have a positive impact on patient
care by enhancing the quality of care
for patients living in low- and midd-
le-income countries. The Chiesi Foun-

dation is committed to improving the

 

health and alleviating the suffering of
patients with respiratory and neonatal
diseases in those countries where the
company does not have a commercial
reach, and access to quality of care is
not always guaranteed. Our work is dri-
ven by a broader definition of patients
and territory which goes well beyond
our direct lines of business.

We established international coope-
ration programs in African and South
American countries to implement two
different models.

The NEST (Neonatal Essential Survi-
val Technology) model aims to reduce
neonatal mortality rates by improving
the quality of neonatal care in coun-
tries with limited resources, paying
specific attention to premature, sick,
unwell and small for gestational age
babies. In 2019, the case study of the
NEST model in Burkina Faso was pu-

blished in the WHO — UNICEF report

“Survive and thrive”. Transforming
care for every small and sick new-
born”. Towards the end of 2019, we
inaugurated a new area dedicated to
the Kangaroo Mother Care Therapy in
Burundi: a simple, safe and efficient
therapy for premature and low-birth
weight babies consisting of continuo-
us skin-to-skin contact.

The GASP (Global Access to Spiro-
metry Project) is focused on the de-
velopment of specific clinical skills
for the diagnosis and management
of chronic respiratory diseases such
as asthma and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), throu-
gh the introduction of spirometry
capacity and training activities. In
addition to this, the programme fo-
cuses on patient education through
medical training, an integral part of
the project. In 2019 we up-scaled the
project in Peru and we consolidated
the one in Guyana.

We also work to increase the aware-
ness and engagement of Chiesi colle-
agues, organising specific events like

the World Prematurity Day which takes

place every year on 17th November.
