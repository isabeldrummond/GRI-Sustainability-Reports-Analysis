3. Diversity Committee
We pay the utmost attention to ensuring a high level of quality of life for all people,
including those who work in the Chiesi world. In view of this, a fundamental

topic is Diversity and Inclusion.

In 2019, the Diversity and Inclusion Committee was created. The Committee has
the aim of monitoring the initiatives related to diversity and inclusion that are
already in place within the Chiesi Group, and defining specific plans to enhance
diversity and inclusion within the company. The priority topics identified are
gender, age, disability and cultural diversity. In 2019, the Committee included 17
members from various Group affiliates and from our Headquarters in Italy. We
consider the creation of the Diversity Committee an important step in having a
structured governance on this topic, fostering an inclusive working environment
and creating a corporate culture considering diversity as a stimulus for growth,

creativity and value for the company and our people.

Our commitments for 2020
Below is a description of the commitment planned for 2020, aimed at achieving

the purpose of common benefit described in this section.

> R&D expenditure

We continue to pursue the objective of contributing to scientific progress with
innovative and up-to-date solutions, seeking to better embrace the challenges
that innovation and new technologies will also bring in the healthcare sector. We
are committed to investing significantly in Research & Development, keeping
our Research expenses around 20% of our revenues, with a particular focus on

neonatology, rare diseases and special care.

> Development of new services for patients in rare diseases

Working in the field of rare diseases is a way to contribute to the improvement of
healthcare access. Our work is truly guided by the perspective of those people
suffering who need a kind of support that goes beyond therapeutic solutions.
In 2019, we set up a Business Unit completely dedicated to the field of rare
diseases. In 2020, we want to further develop this approach, contributing to
services dedicated to supporting patients suffering from rare diseases, with the

aim of making life easier for these people and their caregivers.

> COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) Awareness Campaigns
COPD is a respiratory disease characterised by persistent and irreversible
bronchial obstruction, mainly caused by tobacco smoking and pollution.
The life of a person affected by COPD is by no means simple, considering
that this disease occurs during adulthood, often advanced, and is frequently
characterised by other comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
and lung cancer. COPD is a disease not sufficiently known to the public, and yet

is no less alienating nor impactful for the people suffering from it. Chiesi has
