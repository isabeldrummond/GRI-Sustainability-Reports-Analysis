This study highlighted that the patien-
ts’ use and end of life phases are tho-
se which contribute the most to CO,
emissions, with the propellant being
responsible for more than 90% of to-
tal emissions. This knowledge led us
to research and develop a new low
GWP propellant that enables a drastic
reduction in emissions while safeguar-
ding the effectiveness and the safety

of the product.

e A new low impact generation of
F-gases_ (Fluorinated greenhouse

gases). Chiesi signed the first com-
mercial agreement, with propellant
gas supplier Koura, to secure the
supply of HFA 152a, which is classi-
fied as a low Global Warming Poten-
tial (GWP) propellant, ten times lower
than the currently used, HFA 134a.
Despite the very limited contribu-
tion of HFAs for pharmaceutical use
compared to the total F-gases use,
we have committed to a 5-year, €350

million investment plan, becoming

the first pharmaceutical company
leading the way towards carbon mi-
nimal pMDI solutions that will preser-
ve patients’ choice and wellbeing by
reducing the carbon footprint of our
pMDI by 90%.

e@ We embrace “sustainable chemi-
stry”. Because of the nature of our
business, we regularly manage che-
mical substances which could be
harmful to both humans and to the
environment.

We, therefore, adopted a Sustainable
Chemistry Policy so as to eliminate
and substitute, as first preference, or
minimise with responsible handling,
as second, the use of substance of
very high concern (SVHC). The poli-
cy foresees the implementation of
processes with effective emissions
containment strategies; of reduction
systems with the most innovative
technologies; the avoidance of all
molecules that are persistent, bioac-

cumulative and toxic.
