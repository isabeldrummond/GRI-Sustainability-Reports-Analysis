Final remarks

2019 was Chiesi Farmaceutici's first full calendar year as a Benefit Corporation,
during which we were able to test the operating and management models to

maximise the positive impact on society and the environment.

With this story we hope to contribute, inspire and mobilise, not only the ecosystem
of which our company is part, but also other leaders and entrepreneurs in the
world to undertake a journey similar to ours.

The decisions we make as a business over the next 5 years will have profound
impacts over the coming 20. For this reason, we hope to receive an active
contribution from our business partners, especially in terms of ideas for

improvement.

Appendix: What is a Benefit
Corporation and what
is a B Corp

The Benefit Corporation, known in Italy as Societa Benefit, represents one of the
most advanced models in terms of positive corporate, social and environmental
impact. They are for-profit companies that express a dual objective to the
corporate purpose: to create value for both shareholders and stakeholders.
Together they constitute a global movement of ‘Purpose Driven Businesses’ that
aims to spread a more evolved economic paradigm which sees companies as
protagonists in regenerating society and the biosphere. The Vision is to trigger
positive competition between all companies, so that they are measured and
evaluated in their actions according to the same standard: the positive impact

on society and the planet, as well as economic results.

Since 2016, Italy has been the first sovereign state in the world and the first
country after the United States to introduce Benefit Corporations, a new legal
form of enterprise, which provides a solid basis for aligning and protecting the

company’s mission, as well as creating shared value in the long term.

Benefit Corporations choose to:
— make explicit in their articles of incorporation the purpose for which the
company exists and to balance the interests of shareholders with those of all

other stakeholders

— fully measure all of their impacts and communicate them transparently through

an impact report, which integrates with the company's traditional reporting
