all key risks are identified and mana-
ged effectively in all countries. Chie-
sis Corporate Compliance Commit-
tee, whose members (from the legal,
human resources and internal audit
functions) are appointed by the Board
of Directors, oversees implementation
of these guidelines. In 2015, our com-
mitment to compliance resulted in the
formal assignment of responsibilities
in this area to an autonomous and in-
dependent function: the Group Com-
pliance Office.

A Confidential Reporting System
(‘whistleblowing system”), establi-
shed in 2017, is a direct communica-
tion channel that allows employees at
all levels to report behaviours, such as
a conflict of interest or other miscon-
duct, that might damage the Group's

business or reputation.

Anti-corruption

Our work requires ongoing profes-
sional engagement with healthcare
operators and scientists. We pay con-
siderable attention to the appropriate
management of these relationships,
to exert the highest level of control
to prevent improper or unlawful beha-
viours.

We have implemented several mecha-
nisms to this end. In 2015, we adop-
ted a Corporate Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP) on interactions with
healthcare professionals and _heal-
thcare organisations, which defines a
set of binding principles — in line with
IFMPA™ and EFPIA Code of Conduct
requirements — with which any com-

pany in the Group must comply when

interacting with Healthcare Professio-
nals (HCPs) and Healthcare Organisa-
tions (HCOs). In 2016, we adopted a
Corporate Anti-Bribery Policy, directly
applicable to all Companies of the
Group, which provides a set of guide-
lines on how to recognise and avoid
improper behaviours.

Corporate Internal Auditing is in charge
of carrying out risk assessments and

audits for all Chiesi Group affiliates.

Internal Auditing
Since 2008, a Corporate Internal Audit

function is incorporated and provides
with operational autonomy and orga-
nisational independence from ope-
rational and business functions. The
Head of Internal Auditing is a member
both of the Surveillance Body and of
the Corporate Compliance Committee
and provides auditing activities and in-
vestigation support to them when ne-
cessary. The audit plan and projects in
it are executed in consideration of the
operational risks, as well as the com-
pliance and ethics risks in any geo-
graphy in which the auditing activities
are executed. Therefore, anticorrup-
tion and transparency considerations
are built into the design and execution
of auditing activities.

Audit results are timely and extensi-
vely communicated to management.
Periodic meetings are held with the
Surveillance Body, Corporate Com-
pliance Committee, Statutory Auditors,
and External Auditors in order to share
information, results and insights. The
Board of Directors is briefed on audit

activities and related results annually.
