e We promote collaborations and
round tables at the institutional level.

In our sector, it is crucial to reach the
agenda of institutions, industry as-
sociations and round tables. This is
a fundamental step towards the pro-
motion and advancement of topics
related to our core business.

For this reason, we have a number of
work streams in place, of which we
highlight:

— Drug repurposing: Chiesi has repre-
sented the European Confederation
of Pharmaceutical Enterprises (EU-
COPE) in the STAMP - Commission
Expert Group on Safe and Timely Ac-
cess to Medicines for Patients -, an
initiative launched by the European
Commission. This supports the crea-
tion of a framework outlining the re-
purposing of approved drugs for the
treatment of rare diseases, as well as

for already genericised products.

— Supporting patient-led drug deve-
lopment: Chiesi is an active member

of the International Rare Disease Re-

search Consortium (IRDiRC), an in-
ternational effort to coordinate rare
disease research involving funders,
pharma companies, and umbrella
patient organisations. Chiesi has
brought forward, as a leading party
of IRDiRC’s Therapies Scientific Com-
mittee, an initiative to map all tools
(incentives, facilitations, procedures,
certifications, practices, resources,
among others) available to orphan
drug developers in Europe, the USA,
and Japan, providing ready-to-use
plans and checklists for their integra-
tion into drug development program-
mes. The outcome will be of particular
help in supporting patient-led and aca-
demia-led initiatives of drug develop-

ment and discovery.

—Chiesi’s experience in orphan drug
development and its international
efforts in rare disease research were
included in the EURORDIS Winter
School teaching programme: advan-
ced training given to “patient exper-
ts” who have already graduated from
the Summer School and are aspiring
to become international patient ad-

vocates.
