Highlights

The term “biosphere” could be a synonym to life itself. Without the
biosphere - land, water, air and the energy from the sun - the Earth
would be a lifeless, desolate planet. Human life is intertwined with
the health of the biosphere more than we think. We can have a huge
impact on the Planet, either in a positive or ina negative way. We opted
for the former.

As aB Corp and a Benefit Corporation, we do not just want to be com-
pliant with the legal requirements, we want to make a significant diffe-
rence with our work, because safeguarding the biosphere contributes
to our greatest goal of improving people's health.

Feeling a sense of urgency, we have taken tangible actions at different
levels for measuring, reducing and offsetting CO2.

Our aim is to reach carbon neutrality incrementing the use of renewable
energy, adopting a sustainable chemistry approach, and mapping the
waste from our industrial processes.

We pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035, well before the 2050
target set out in the Paris agreement.

The Paris agreement is the first-ever universal, legally binding global
climate change agreement, adopted at the Paris climate conference
(COP21) in December 2015.

This is the highest of ambitions. Highest because it means having a net
zero carbon footprint on this planet. Hence, it is not enough to correct
just a few aspects. It requires designing a system able to measure, mi-
nimise and compensate the impact of all of the operations undertaken.
It is an ambitious aim that requires both the heart - a solid company
culture - and the mind - the technical capacities.

Our work does not only address carbon neutrality. We are also con-
fronting other industry-specific necessities.

So, while we are enthusiastic about this challenge, aware of the ex-
tra-ordinary complexity of this mission, we also recognise the unfore-
