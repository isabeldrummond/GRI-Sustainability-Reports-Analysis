of electronics to inhaler devices and
connecting the inhaler to the pa-
tients’ smartphone, allowing a sub-
sequent link to the prescribing phy-
sician as well. Such initiatives are
seen as effective vehicles to enhan-
ce patient-engagement with their
treatments and to directly improve
patient benefits and the essential re-
lationship with the caregiver.

In addition to innovation in the inha-
ler device field, we have continued
to develop our innovative formula-
tion technologies. These, along with
the key features of our devices, en-
sure delivery of extrafine aerosols,
which maximise lung delivery and
guarantees that medicaments treat
both the large and, importantly, the
extensive small peripheral airways.
This highly effective lung targeting
optimises both treatment efficacy
and dosing, to enhance tolerability
and product safety.

Our product developments are not
limited to the major and widespread
diseases of asthma and COPD, but
also to the devastating conditions
of cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis,
pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary
arterial hypertension; diseases with
significant patient morbidity and re-
duced life expectancy. A new recent
focus is chronic cough, a symptom
instead of a disease, which may
have a huge negative impact on pe-
ople’s quality of life, with profound
socio-economic consequences in

those affected.

Neonatology

Our focus in neonatology brings us
close to one of the most delicate me-
dical fields and frail patient popula-

tions with huge unmet needs. Babies

born prematurely and their families
have been largely neglected in terms
of commitment and innovation. We
are therefore very proud and motiva-
ted to be delivering meaningful sup-
port to this most deserving group.

When babies are born prematurely,
perhaps as soon as 25 weeks of
gestational age or 15 weeks before
the natural delivery date, many of the
body organs and systems are not
fully developed and are, therefore,
dysfunctional, as the baby starts his
or her new life. Among those organs
are the lungs, which can efficiently
execute their action of performing
an appropriate gas exchange (intake
of oxygen and discharge of carbon
dioxide) only if completely develo-
ped. This action is facilitated by a
natural complex compound called
surfactant, which is produced by a
specific type of mature lung cells.

In premature babies, the production
of surfactant is severely reduced. In
the field of neonatology, our flagship
development is poractant alfa, a life
saving product used to treat 5.3 mil-
lion premature babies in nearly 100
countries premature worldwide by
providing an effective replacement
for the natural lung surfactant es-
sential for normal breathing. This
life-saving treatment is commonly
delivered through an invasive, al-
beit safe, placement of a tube into
the baby’s airways. In the pursuit of
improving patients’ quality of life,
we have developed an alternative; a
more patient-friendly and less inva-
sive delivery modality for surfactant
replacement. A series of new pro-
grams in partnership with our inter-
national network of neonatologists

and specialists is also in place.
