ced 46.3% of its goods from national

on local suppliers represents 59.2%
of global supply expenses, keeping

the overall impact well above 50%".

 

e We are members of the PSC! initia-
tive because the greatest challenges

can only be overcome together. We
strongly believe in the power of col-
laboration and sharing as a strategic
means for industry advancement.
This is why, in 2018, we joined the
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initia-
tive (PSCI) network. PSCI is a group
of pharmaceutical and healthcare
companies that have the common
aspiration of improving at the social,
health, safety and environmental per-
formance in the pharma sector supply
chain. We believe that PSC members
can share knowledge and expertise
across our industry to drive complex
global change more effectively than
any one organization alone.

This program reinforces our commit-
ment to SDG 17: “Strengthen the me-
ans of implementation and revitalise
the global partnership for sustainable
development”.

In essence, this fosters and mobilises
multi-stakeholder partnerships, sha-

ring knowledge, expertise, technology

 

and resources to support the achieve-
ment of the sustainable development

goals at a global scale.

e We are designing our sustainability
assessment tool for logistic opera-
tions. Our Logistics department be-
gan a comprehensive analysis of the
overall impact of our global logistic
network, aiming to design a model al-
lowing the evolution of logistics, gui-
ded by sustainability principles. Logi-
stics is one of the operational areas
where improvement is not only pos-
sible but it can also determine larger
results, either in terms of improving
efficiency on “classic” variables (such
as cost, service level and quality), or
on specific new environmental and
societal objectives that we decided
to integrate into our operational stan-
dards. In 2019, we started a project
aimed at creating organisational con-
ditions, specific know-how, analysis
models and information infrastructu-
re with the goal of designing our new
logistics model that will measure its
environmental and social impact.
This model, to be finalised in 2020, is
a key pillar of the more general 2035

Carbon Neutrality goal.
