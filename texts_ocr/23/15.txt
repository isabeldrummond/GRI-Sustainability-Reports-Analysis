Materiality Matrix

Materiality and stakeholder engagement

The Materiality Analysis is a key instrument to understand which issues are of
relevance for the stakeholders and are influenced by the business and therefore
should receive close attention by the company management. In 2019, we refi-
ned our materiality analysis, maintaining the material topics identified in our 2018
assessment as a baseline. We also integrated some new topics such as “sustai-
nable products” and redefined some others such as “access to healthcare”. We
removed the topic “Corporate Governance’, since we believe it is implicit and tran-
sversally covered by more than one material topic.

Following this review, we conducted an analysis which aimed at ranking the mate-
riality of each topic on two levels: the impact of the topics in relation to the Chiesi
business, and its relevance for our main stakeholders. With the term “impact” we
considered both how the topic can influence the Chiesi business and how our
business can influence the topic.

Chiesi Impact Committee, an internal body created in 2019 for the analysis and
reporting of the company’s impact, was responsible for this process. The mate-
riality analysis then underwent the approval of our CEO and Board of Directors.
We have retained 14 material topics, represented in the matrix below, as the result

of the internal analysis and stakeholder engagement activities.
