*Data scope increased compared to 2018. 2018 figures referred only to production sites, Parma R&D
center and the Parma - via Palermo office. Data 2019 include all production, research and commercial

sites except from Germany, NHCO, Nordics office, Poland and USA. Some data have been estimated.
Data from 2019 with the same scope of 2018 is 3,749.2 tonnes.

 

 

 

The higher values observed of waste generation and water consumption for 2018 compa-
red to 2019 were mainly due to the establishment and fine-tuning of a new production de-

partment at our Parma manufacturing site. 2019 data are line with previous years’ values.
