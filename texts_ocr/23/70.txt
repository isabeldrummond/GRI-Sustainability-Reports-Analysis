Taking a leading role towards a sustainable value
chain is the result of a comprehensive plan of
action that the Group is implementing. The main
initiatives that ran in 2019 are described below.

e With our suppliers, we co-created
the first SDG-enabled Code of Con-
duct to define shared guidelines. We
named it Code of Interdependence. In
the spirit of maximum collaboration,
we decided to involve about 70 of our
strategic supply partners to design this
new code of conduct. We evolved the
concept of a supply chain into that of
an ecosystem, recognising that each
of us is indispensable and can bring
value to the other through a process of

mutual learning and co-evolution.

Throughout this process, we were
inspired by the most progressive mo-
vements and frameworks beyond our
field: Pharmaceutical Supply Chain
Initiative (PSCI), B Impact Assessment
by B Lab, International Labour Organi-
zation (ILO) and the United Nations’ Su-
stainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Together, we solidified the behaviou-
ral principles to be used in guiding the
work of each of us. This makes the
Code an expression of the combined
effort put in throughout 2019 in defi-
ning the way we operate in the world
and with each other. For this reason, it
was named accordingly: The Code of
Interdependence.

This document also valorises the ap-
proach of our suppliers towards su-
stainability, and provides a set of to-
pics that shall be relevant for all of us,
such as quality of products, safety of

employees, the use of environmental

resources and much more. We belie-
ve this exercise can enhance accoun-
tability towards our common purpose

and values.

All affiliates engaged worldwide
+120 people actively involved

+70 strategic suppliers involved

e We integrated sustainability in re-

lation to our suppliers and in the cri-
teria for their selection. If we want to

accelerate sustainable development, it
is essential that our entire supply chain
evolves with us. This is why, in 2019,
we introduced specific sustainability
topics into our suppliers’ qualification
process. This allowed us to gather
essential information, enhancing our
knowledge and monitoring capabilities
of a partner from a sustainability per-
spective, going beyond the concepts
of price-quality-service as only drivers
of the relationship. Sustainability con-
cepts will also become part of new
suppliers’ evaluation processes. We
have also inserted sustainability prin-
ciples into specific tenders’ evaluation

procedures.

@ We want to have a positive impact
on the economic development of the

community, sourcing also from local
suppliers. In 2019, in Italy, Chiesi sour-
