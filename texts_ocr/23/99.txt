Takeaways:

— Chiesi does not have a specific business model designed to contribute to
gender equality. However, we have aligned our social and environmental perfor-
mance strategy throughout our practices and processes to specifically address
the SDG 5 targets.

— For the internal operations area, we discovered that we have a solid perfor-
mance in all of the evaluation topics, such as women's representation in the wor-
kforce and management, gender discrimination management. At the same time,
we are aware that we have further steps to take to address the pay gap issue.

— Our Suppliers Code of Interdependence, with provisions about gender equality
and non-discrimination, along with the procurement policy that gives preference
to women-owned businesses, are recognised as good practices that contribute
to SDG 5.

— Our policy making strategy does not include any initiatives specifically desi-
gned to advocate for policy changes to contribute to SDG 5 (either at individual

or collective level).

— Chiesi shows a low level of risk in negatively affecting or inhibiting SDG 5.
