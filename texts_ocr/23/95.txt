The Role of Business

At Chiesi, we firmly believe in the value of the SDGs and we put our best efforts
into their implementation. In order to maximise the results of our actions, we

able to offer.

Our commitment to SDGs stems from a deep sense of responsibility about our
impact and, at the same time, an important awareness of the role of business
in fostering the transition to a long-term sustainable economic system.

The strength of business is an essential element and driving force for the
achievement of SDGs, but so far this drive has been held back by the lack of
shared tools to guide and support companies towards internal reflection and
specific, meaningful actions.

The need to bridge this gap led to a solid partnership in 2017 between the UN
Global Compact (UNGC) - the UN agency responsible for guiding and suppor-
ting the global business community in advancing UN goals and values through
responsible corporate practices - and B Lab - the US based non-profit organi-
sation that develops B Corp's measurement tools and encourages their wor-
Idwide diffusion. In a collaboration that has lasted more than two years, the
two actors have put together, on the one hand, the great institutional reach,
content expertise and global extension of the UNGC and, on the other hand,
the robustness, innovativeness and accuracy of a platform for measuring im-

pacts such as the B Impact Assessment by B Lab.
