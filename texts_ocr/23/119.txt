Specific purpose of common
benefit (IV):

Promotion of a conscious and sustainable way of
conducting business, also through collaborative dia-
logue with stakeholders.

What we did in 2019

As a B Corp and Benefit Corporation we believe that interdependence is a
primary value. Every part of the system is connected with the others and these
relationships are the basis for boosting the positive impact created by the
company. In order to expand the value that we are able to generate we cannot
ignore the involvement of our stakeholders and this is particularly true when we
talk about value chains.

Chiesi's commitment to this purpose of common benefit in 2019 includes the

implementation of the following actions:

1. Suppliers’ code of interdependence

Chiesi Group's Supplier Code of Interdependence is an innovative and unique
tool, both in terms of its structure (based on the United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goals) and in terms of content, which includes sustainability
topics. The code was co-created with the contribution of 120 people from Chiesi
Group and the representatives of 70 international suppliers, in a process that
has enabled them to fully share and adhere to the values of the code. It was

approved by Chiesi Executive Committee at the end of 2019.

The points of the Code will not simply represent a list of directives, but a
shared responsibility so as to generate a virtuous circle for all on an economic,

environmental and social level.

The publication on www.chiesi.com took place in February 2020, and formal
implementation is planned throughout the year. For our Headquarters, the Code
of Interdependence will be included in the supplier qualification processes, while

we are working with all of our affiliates to support its implementation locally.

2. Training programme “We ACT Educational”

We Actively Care for Tomorrow was Chiesi's sustainability programme launched
in 2018 which included a plan to engage and raise awareness on sustainability
among Chiesi employees. "We ACT Educational", a training programme
dedicated to sustainability, was also included in this plan. The topics covered
the basic principles of environmental and social sustainability, the United
Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, B Corp and Benefit Corporations,
and the presentation of some corporate projects arising from our sustainability

strategic plan. This training project has been extended to the entire Chiesi Group
