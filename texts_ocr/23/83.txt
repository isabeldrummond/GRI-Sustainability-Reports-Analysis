Highlights

We have always had ethics at the centre of our work. This principle has
guided us through our history. This implies going beyond compliance, for
example in significant areas like regulatory tax frameworks. It's a matter
of conducting fair business with maximum transparency.

CHIESI IS THE FIRST ITALIAN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY
TO ENTER THE COOPERATIVE COMPLIANCE REGIME

Our reputation is rooted in our tradition. One fundamental aspect lies in
how we contribute to the correct distribution of wealth in the countries in
which we operate. Thanks to our commitment, in 2019 Chiesi became the
first Italian pharmaceutical company to enter the Cooperative Compliance

Regime held by the Italian Tax Agency, which aims to improve transparency
and fair distribution of taxes in the countries in which we operate.
