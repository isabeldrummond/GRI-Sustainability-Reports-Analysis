Increasing the transparency and ethical practices
of business is possible through various corporate
governance activities. Some relevant aspects are

described below.

e We implemented a Cooperative ap-
proach with the tax authorities, on top

of other means, for a fair distribution

of value in the countries we operate.
For a few years, the OECD (Organiza-

 

tion for Economic Co-operation and
Development) has been pointing out
that tax audits for large taxpayers are
highly inefficient because companies
have to keep track of multiple data
and documents and tax authorities
must focus on an immense amount of
data. Thus, the OECD has suggested,
to all jurisdictions, enacting coopera-
tive approaches between taxpayers
and tax administration in order to tra-
de disclosure and certainty within a
frame constituted by a new, open and
fair approach. We decided to embrace
this landmark shift in the relationship
with tax authorities, with the ultimate
objective of having the tax authorities
as partners in a transparent exchange
of information. Therefore, in 2014 we
already voluntarily participated in a
pilot project involving 84 Italian com-
panies, but only the top 10 in terms of
turnover were selected. When the pilot
project was turned into a structural pro-
gramme, in 2018 we applied for the Co-
operative Compliance Regime held by
the Italian Tax Agency. The programme
required Chiesi to establish an inter-
nal tax risk detection, regulation, ma-
nagement and control system in line
with the OECD requirements, which
for us implied the need to engage 13
departments and reviewing 65 internal
procedures and guidelines. Such an

effort allowed Chiesi to become the

first Italian pharmaceutical company
to enter this programme in 2019 - as
of today in Italy there are only about
25 companies that have signed up to
this requirement, being recognised, ina
broad sense, as Best Contributors.
Such achievement comes on top of
other long-lasting tax risk manage-
ment frameworks we already have
in place, such as the Advanced Price
Agreements with the Italian Tax Agen-
cy, with whom we share and agree the
remuneration of transactions with our
affiliates in various countries. Such
arrangements implies that Chiesi Italy,
as long as it sets the distribution of re-
muneration to its affiliates — and, ulti-
mately, the taxes due by them in their
respective countries — in compliance
with the agreement with the Italian Tax
Agency, will not be subject to tax audits
on this topic for a period of up to five
years. These agreements recognise
and certify Chiesi as a reliable taxpayer
both as Chiesi Italy and with respect to
the transactions towards its affiliates.
But we went further. At the end of 2019
we were selected to participate in ICAP
(International Compliance Assurance
Programme), an innovative worldwide
pilot project where multinational en-
terprises disclose certain selected tax
data with a group of Tax Authorities,
carrying out an open and frank combi-
ned tax risk assessment. The ultimate
goal of this pilot project, following a se-
ties of meetings to take place in 2020
at the OECD where Chiesi’s position
will be scrutinised, will be to draft agre-

ements not only with the Italian Tax
