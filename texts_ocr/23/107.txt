— Target 3.8 Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk pro-
tection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, ef-

fective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all

— Target 3.9 By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses
from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination.

The use of the SDG Action Manager tool allowed us to assess our contribution to
our 9 priority SDGs, but also underlined the interconnectedness of the SDGs and
the importance of having a comprehensive and broad approach towards all 17
SDGs. This analysis enabled us to highlight also those on which we have an impact
without focussing our efforts directly, for example SDG 16 — Peace, Justice and
Strong Institutions. This specific SDG highlights our company’s transparent appro-
ach - which we have also brought to our supplier relationships through the supplier
Code of Interdependence - and our commitment to sustainable development, throu-
gh our governance and changes in our Articles of Incorporation to become a Benefit

Corporation.

In conclusion, the SDG Action Manager analysis led us to broaden our vision and

reflect on our future strategic directions.
