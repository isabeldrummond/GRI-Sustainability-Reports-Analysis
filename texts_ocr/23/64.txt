e Health, safety and environment
management and the identification of
the main hazards is carried out in ac-
cordance with local regulations and

HSE Corporate guidelines.

For each accident, a specific root cau-
se analysis is carried out to identify
corrective and preventive actions.
Each Chiesi site is compliant with re-
gulations and manages HSE aspects
locally through continuous risk asses-
sments, analyses, improvement plans
and implementation of specific pre-
ventative actions in accordance with
local legislation. All the production
sites are OHSAS 18001 certified and

are updating their system to migrate to
the international standard ISO 45001.
They also have a near-miss reporting
system that emphasises preventative
rather than corrective actions. Each
management system monitors health
and safety aspects for both employees
and outsiders.

There are initiatives in place to involve
workers in health and safety manage-
ment, such as the identification and
promotion of safe behaviours, and
both general and specific training on
safety is carried out. There were no
fatality nor high-consequence injuries

during the reporting period.
