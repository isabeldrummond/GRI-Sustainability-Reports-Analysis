Impact report reviewed
by Nativa

This impact report is the result of a process of collaboration between Chiesi
Farmaceutici SpA and Nativa Srl SB, inspired by the values of transparency,
trust and interdependence and designed to ensure the reliability and accuracy
of what is reported.

The ultimate goal of this process is the validation by Nativa of both the
updating of the impact measurement using the B Impact Assessment tool
and a continuous and effective commitment to work towards the progressive
achievement of specific purposes of common benefit.

The Review process is structured in three areas:

1) Organisation: to ensure that key roles by area of expertise have been involved

and to ensure the necessary know-how to update the BIA.

In this specific case the company has increased the level of preparation of the

organisation with the design and dissemination of a support handbook.

2) Data reliability: to ensure that the data and information produced are based
on a quality structured process.

In this specific case, the company has designed a process for collecting
and verifying company data, structured so as to involve the main company
functions. A quality check mechanism has also been implemented to guarantee
the reliability of the data itself.

3) Quality check of the BIA compilation: to ensure the correct compilation of the

analysis tool.

In this specific case, the BIA update responses have been checked and validated
with the team contact person responsible for the compilation through a drill
down of the impact areas most affected by the change of standards from V5 to
V6 of the BIA and the improvement actions implemented during 2019. Finally,
a validation was carried out through the verification of the documental support
and the most important data.
