We are also developing a treatment
for Fabry Disease, another lysoso-
mal storage disorder, wherein the
novel product seeks to provide a
less frequently-dosed, and therefo-
re more patient-friendly treatment,
associated also with reduced immu-
nogenicity, thus enhancing patients’
safety. Fabry Disease is characteri-
sed by specific neurological, cuta-
neous, renal, cardiovascular, coch-
leo-vestibular and cerebrovascular
manifestations.

Beyond our treatments, Chiesi sup-

ports the rare diseases field throu-

gh a series of multichannel aware-
ness-raising programs to improve
the quantity and quality of informa-
tion available to clinicians, patients,
and families.

The Global Rare Diseases Business
Unit is also actively building colla-
borative relationships with all sta-
keholders in the rare disease space,
including for example International
Rare Disease Research Consortium
IRDiRC, European Confederation of
Pharmaceutical Enterprises (EUCO-
PE) as well as patient organisations
all around the world.
