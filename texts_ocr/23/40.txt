Highlights

At Chiesi, the R&D division is at the very heart of the company. We have
innovation in our DNA and finding solutions is our vocation. We rely on and
invest in R&D because we see it as the key to succeed in our work and to
realise our mission.

In 2019, we spent 19% of our revenues on Research & Development. We are
the first among the Italian pharmaceutical companies, the second among
Italian manufacturing companies and fourteenth among European phar-
maceutical companies for investments in research.

We view sharing and transparency as two essential values, and moral obli-
gations, for the pharmaceutical community. Sharing clinical trial data and
information can be almost as important as running the clinical studies.
Circulating R&D study results can strengthen the medical community and
maximise the beneficial effects that our industry can have on people.
Wanting to minimise any possible negative effect of a products’ research
and development, we are working on a sustainable, future fit, R&D process,
where sustainability is integrated by design. With this in mind, we adopted
tools and practices not only to measure our impact, but also, and more im-
portantly, to create products that are sustainable from the outset.
