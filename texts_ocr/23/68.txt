Highlights

Value chains are the backbone of every business model. Throughout
our value chain, we involve many stakeholders upstream and down-
stream, including pharmacies and hospitals, from the transformation of
raw materials and components till the delivery of our products to those
who need them, our patients. It is a crucial process, characterised by in-
terdependence of various actors, where positive impact on both people
and the environment can either be maximised or weakened.

As a B Corp and a Benefit Corporation, Chiesi feels the need to ensure
that the entire chain of processes and activities related to its operations,
be them primary or support activities, responds to the social and sustai-
nable criteria Chiesi is committed to.

During 2019, our starting point to implement such an approach was our
supply chain. We have the ambition to set up and run a supply chain
where purpose and positive values determine every stage. We envision
a system where each supplier collaborates with us, moving in the same
direction with the same ethics.

But here lies the complexity. Turning supply chains into sustainable
ecosystems requires a holistic, bottom-up view, where each of our 15
thousand plus suppliers adhere to and act according to the same values.
This is why we have designed and developed a relationship framework
in partnership with our suppliers: Chiesi’s Code of Interdependence.
