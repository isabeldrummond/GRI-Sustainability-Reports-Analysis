Note: The Group will carry out an analysis concerning the relevance of workers who are not
employees, in order to consider the possibility to gather data from the employers of workers
who are not employees and the suppliers who work in the Group's plants and/or the control of
the Group, taking into consideration the quality and the accuracy of those data over which the
Group has no direct control.
