e We are part of the team that fo-
sters the submission of Parma Eu-
ropean Green Capital in 2022. In
collaboration with other partners,
like the Parma municipality and the
Foundation for Sustainable Deve-
lopment, we actively contributed to
the drafting of the environmental
policies dossier, and in particular to
the definition of specific actions on
how to reduce emissions, develop a
climate adaptation plan, reduce car
mobility, create green conservation
areas, improve air quality, reduce
noise pollution, water consumption
and waste production.

It is a great opportunity to make
Parma an innovative and virtuous

community.

e We are contributing to the 11-ki-

lometre green belt to protect Par-
ma. The topic of air pollution repre-
sents an important environmental
issue for the territory of Parma and
in general the Emilia Romagna re-
gion. In Parma, the busy A1 mo-
torway, a major source of pollution,
runs alongside to the city. Chiesi is
an active part of the design and de-
velopment team of the “Green Kilo-
metre” project. The initiative, initially
focused on the creation of an 11 km
green barrier along the motorway,
has now evolved into a much bigger
project of urban reforestation of the
Parma province. Through a partner-
ship between the municipality and
the land owners, The Green Kilome-
tre aims to reduce air and noise pol-
lution and, even more importantly,
to raise environmental awareness
among citizens. In 2019, we acti-
vely contributed by planting around

6,500 trees, plants, shrubs and bu-

shes both in our new Headquarters

and in our Research Centre.

e We launched the Volunteering
Month. Since 2015 we have promo-
ted the “Volunteer Week” in our Hea-
dquarters in Parma and other corpo-
rate volunteering activities across all
our branches. During this week, our
employees work for local non-profit
organisations. In 2019, in Parma, we
extended this period to the “Volun-
teer Month” involving up to 620 peo-
ple with 2480 hours of volunteering
in different projects: environmental
protection, multiculturalism, poverty
reduction, and support to the most

vulnerable groups such as the elderly.

e@ We celebrated the We ACT Day,
on 25th September, at our Research
Centre. We ACT Day was born from the
desire to inform and engage our em-
ployees on the topics of sustainability.
Itis a moment to share what we can all
do to contribute towards sustainable
development. The day is a celebration
of the Sustainable Development Go-
als defined by the 2030 Agenda of the
UN on 25th September 2015. In 2019,
we celebrated the We ACT Day in our
Research Centre, organised as a full-
day festival involving employees, par-
tners, local non-profit associations,
institutions and many guests sharing
themes, projects, activities, and confe-
rences about the 9 specific SDGs that
Chiesi decided to adopt.

e We launched the “No Longer
Alone” project (‘Progetto Non Piu
Soli’), addressed towards the elder-
ly recently discharged from _hospi-
tals. Chiesi collaborates with local

associations and institutions, such
