The pharma industry is expanding rapidly and so is the world in terms
of its approach to global health. This growth raises a question around
the adoption of ethical practices in the development of products, and in
rethinking how we relate to our patients. We have a moral responsibility
towards the betterment of society, and that cannot solely happen throu-
gh what we produce but also how we produce it.

The traditional pharmaceutical model is concentrated on molecules and
mechanisms of action, and not always on the patients’ needs and experien-
ces. Instead, we feel we should start from the patients, to develop the the-
rapies that they really require.

Placing patients at the centre is not just a statement. It means finding new
ways that allow the whole Research and Development process to be guided
by the needs of those patients: to adopt the patients’ perspective, under-
standing their needs and collecting their feedback to tailor specific thera-
peutic solutions to them. It ultimately means revolutionising the model.

We focus mainly on respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD, Cystic
Fibrosis and neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). To breathe
means to live. One of our leading life saving product has been used, sin-
ce its discovery, to treat 5.3 million premature babies suffering from Re-
spiratory Distress Syndrome.

In 2019, we set-up our Global Rare Diseases unit located in Boston.
It is dedicated to rare diseases because everyone, even the most vulne-
rable patients, must be considered. People affected by rare diseases today
often have no treatments or limited access to effective treatments.

We began the build-out of a Global Patient Advocacy function to ensure
the voice of patients, including patient associations, is included in our
approach to product development.
