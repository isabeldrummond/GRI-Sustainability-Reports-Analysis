The Struggles we are Facing

Growing a solid, long-lasting company culture is a challenge

Chiesi is building a strong culture around the B Corp principles and values, enga-
ging all employees with the aim of also spreading these values to our partners.
The difficulty lies in building solid foundations for this culture to survive and
thrive in the future. We need solid strategies for our Company culture to beco-
me deep rooted. We acknowledge the need to develop intelligent and creative
tools so that our set of values are cultivated and nourished by people, becoming
long-lasting and transversal to all processes, and spreading throughout the or-

ganisation as a whole at global level.

Gender disparity rebalance is difficult to implement
Gender inequality can take place in the career gap, in the pay gap, across all

functions, and across generations. In order to be monitored and managed it
needs a strong strategic approach, but also a viable and sustainable system

and policy:

Not all employees around the world are able to access the same training op-
portunities. As of today, the majority of the programs are provided mainly in
our headquarters. In the future all best practices shall be extended to all of the

affiliates.
