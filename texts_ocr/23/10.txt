In 2019 we then became a certified
B Corporation (B Corp) to strengthen
our commitment. Chiesi received B
Corp certification from the leading
global sustainability non-profit B
Lab®, in recognition of our corpo-
rate sustainability practices. This is
one of the most fundamental steps
to achieving our stated vision of

continuous improvement towards

a sustainable future. Chiesi is the
largest pharmaceutical group to be
awarded B Corp certification with

87.5 points.

We undertook the B Impact Asses-
sment (BIA), which measures the
positive impact of a company on its
workers, community, environment,
and customers, and we started a
global improvement plan, finally be-

coming eligible for certification.
