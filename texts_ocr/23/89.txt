~ The Struggles we are Facing

A global citizenship strategy must be locally applicable.

 

We want to develop a corporate citizenship strategy that can maximise our in-
tervention as an expression of our civic sense in every country we operate. This
global strategy must be as efficient and effective as possible to avoid wasting
time, energy and capital. It must also be able to be decoded and understood in
different, culturally-specific contexts, allowing the global approach to be transla-

ted at a local level.
