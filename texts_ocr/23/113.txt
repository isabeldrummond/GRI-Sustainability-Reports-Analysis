Specific purpose of common
benefit (I):

Commitment to continuous and sustainable innova-
tion of processes and all business practices in order
to minimise negative impacts and amplify positive
impacts on people, the biosphere and the territory.

What we did in 2019
Chiesi's commitment to this purpose of common benefit was carried on in 2019
with specific attention to the environmental impact generated by the company.

This priority was reflected in the implementation of the following actions:

1.Carbon Footprint

We completed the carbon footprint analysis concerning those products that, in
terms of importance, volume and potential environmental impact, particularly in
terms of GWP (Global Warming Potential) linked to the propellant they contain,
are considered of greater importance: the inhaler devices for the treatment of
chronic respiratory diseases. In 2019, we calculated the carbon footprint of
all our inhalation products (pressurized metered dose inhalers - pMDI and dry
powder inhalers - DPI). The target was the completion, by the end of the year, of
the carbon footprint analysis of the entire life cycle of the product including raw
materials, production processes, end use of the product and its disposal.

This activity was successfully completed and allowed us to obtain Certiquality
certification, according to the standard ISO 14067. We also had a peer review
testifying the conformity of the process adopted. The review was carried out by

the international body Carbon Trust (UK).

2.Energy efficiency

Energy efficiency is, together with reducing energy consumption, another crucial
point of the journey towards achieving net zero carbon footprint. In 2019, an
energy audit was completed in compliance with the legal standard on energy
audits. Our approach also includes the implementation of an Energy Management
System. The energy performance assessment and all related activities will also
be a useful baseline for future certification processes in accordance with the ISO
50001 standard.

3.Sustainable Chemistry Policy

In addition to activities related to CO2 emissions, we are also working on other
forms of environmental impact. Regarding the topic of chemistry in particular,
we acted to ensure that the management of raw materials, manufacturing and
research processes comply with sustainable chemistry criteria.

In 2019, we developed a Sustainable Chemistry Policy regarding the proper

management of chemicals and the high safety standards we want to ensure
