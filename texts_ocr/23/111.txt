earliest stages of research. This is an important evolution that will take time, but

will greatly contribute to people's quality of life.

A change is therefore underway that requires huge capacity for adaptation.
And this will probably be our greatest challenge. The epochal developments
we face in medical research and biotechnology, in production processes, in the
way we work and collaborate, together with the universal priorities imposed by
the climate crisis, growing inequalities, and globalisation as summarised by the
United Nations Agenda 2030 in the 17 sustainable development goals, will have

an impact on us as individuals and as a business.

We want to meet these changes with responsibility and courage to seize all
the opportunities, with the transparency and ethical sense that have always

distinguished our history and our culture.

The beginning of 2020, the period in which this document was written, has been
extremely complex for the entire world, particularly for the area in which our
Headquarters is based, in the north of Italy. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a
significant impact on the social and economic mechanisms not only in our country,
but also at a global scale. At this time of uncertainty, as a company particularly
active in its local community, we are trying to make a significant contribution to
support our territory, which is particularly marked by this emergency. While hoping
for the opposite, we share the concern that the current situation, during the course
of the year, may change the implementation of some of the initiatives contained
in this document. For 2020, we are therefore committed to continuing the various
activities described here, giving priority to the support of our community, the

constant supply of our medicines and the safety of our workers.

We ACT
Sustainability Manifesto

We live in a time of great changes. The planet is exploited beyond its limits and
its equilibriums are in continuous transformation. We are changing ourselves in
the way we live and think about our society. The most fragile and vulnerable are

paying the price: those who are often left behind in this rush forward.

At Chiesi we have always believed that it is necessary to take care of our planet
and the people who inhabit it, rediscovering the value of mutual solidarity, as we
are aware that every individual, as well as every living organism, is unique and

irreplaceable.

This is why we want to make the assurance of high-quality medical research
available for the most fragile individuals so that we can closely listen to and

understand them as people, not just as patients.
