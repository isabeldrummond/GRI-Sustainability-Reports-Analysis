At_Chiesi, we have fully embraced this crucial _and_ambitious

 

perspective. We are innately experimenters, we design, innovate and

create new solutions.

As a group, we have always applied our responsibility through the

 

products we make, the processes we set up, the value chain we manage
and the company culture we shape. In 2018 we made the choice to become
a Benefit Corporation and in 2019, our dedication was recognised and
allowed us to become the largest pharmaceutical Group to be awarded
B Corp certification.

The group embarked on this fascinating journey and I am glad to see that
this acknowledgement has catalysed our energy and enthusiasm. People
are proud to contribute to the change they see coming, to being a part of

the solution to the problem as opposed to the cause.

This report will serve as a logbook, aiming to share our journey in an
effort to inspire others to join us. We want to show the different levels

that we worked on and the activities we implemented to create a positive
impact. Ultimately, this document shows how we decided to operate and
position ourselves in the world. We can no longer separate the care of our
patients, our core driver in everything that we do, from the health of our
world as a whole and its environmental and human resources. At the same
time, we also want to share the challenges and the difficulties that we are
facing to stimulate a collective thinking on solutions and opportunities.

Alberto Chiesi,
Chairman
