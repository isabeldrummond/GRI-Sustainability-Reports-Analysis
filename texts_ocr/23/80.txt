This study was conducted using the LOCAL FOOTPRINT® tool developed by UTOPIES. It enables to measure
the order of magnitude of the gross economic weight of CHIESI in 220 world countries, analyzing the impact of the
economic flows generated by the company’s activity in 2018. The jobs reported here are salaried and non-salaried
jobs expressed in «Full-Time Equivalents» to reflect the number of equivalent years of work.

The LOCAL FOOTPRINT® model is based on Input-Output tables that trace the economic links between sectors
of activity, private and public, and the household's consumption. This is the most realistic way of representing an
economic system. Further details of the methodology available at www.utopies.com.
