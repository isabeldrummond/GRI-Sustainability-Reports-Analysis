Takeaways:

— Our business model is not specifically designed to build resilient infrastructu-
re, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation.
Chiesi's commitment results in the alignment of our social and environmental

performance throughout our practices and processes to address SDG 9 targets.

— The assessment for the category ‘Internal Operations’ has fully recognised
Chiesi’s point of excellence in R&D and our commitment to promoting the use
of technology for research innovation. Furthermore, our Environmental Manage-
ment System and water conservation practices were highlighted as strengths.
Chiesi's performance could improve in conservation and in the percentage of

company facilities certified accordingly to Green Building Standards.

— The analysis has rewarded our contribution in R&D and technology with our
suppliers. Investment in local and Small and medium-sized enterprises sup-

pliers remains low, reflecting a characteristic of our industry.
— Our policy making strategy does not include any initiatives specifically desi-
gned to advocate for policy changes to contribute to SDG 9 (either at individual

or collective level).

— Chiesi shows a low level of risk in negatively affecting or inhibiting SDG 9.
