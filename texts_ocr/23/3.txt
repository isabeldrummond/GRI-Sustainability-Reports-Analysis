The world of business, called to take an active role in working towards

 

those solutions, is responding. There is an ongoing conversation on how
companies should behave and what their role should be beyond liability.

Business ethics are debated as the very foundation of success.

For the first time in history, reputable actors and specialized press urged
the business sector to do its part to reset capitalism which has by now

proven to be insufficient to face the new global scenarios.

There is a cultural shift taking place, moving the economy away from the
old “shareholder capitalism” interpretation, where generating profit for the
shareholders is at the core, towards a “stakeholder capitalism’, able to cultivate
prosperity for all, from people to planet.

As humans, we are moving from the short sighted and profit focused
system towards a renewed and more human economic and social paradigm.
