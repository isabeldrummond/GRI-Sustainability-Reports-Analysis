Takeaways:

— Our business model is not specifically designed to ensure sustainable consu-
mption and production patterns. Chiesi’s commitment results in the alignment of
our social and environmental performance throughout our practices and proces-

ses to address SDG 12 targets.

— With regard to the ‘Internal Operations’ category, the tool recognises Chiesi’s
commitment in encouraging responsible consumption and production. In particu-
lar, the reporting method we chose for our social and environmental performance
represents the company’s commitment to transparency. Some of the more diffi-
cult points can be traced back to typical challenges of the pharma sector, such as
the longevity of products, the reduction of end of life waste and the percentage of
environmentally preferred materials (from recycled materials, reused componen-
ts, and/or certified sustainably sourced materials). The difficulty in intervening in

these matters also stems from the strict regulation of our sector.

— Our Suppliers Code of Interdependence includes specific indications to ensure
responsible consumption and production. In this area of evaluation, special reco-
gnition is also given to Chiesi’s chemical management system. Beyond our stren-
gths, we came to understand that we need to focus more on waste management

across the entire supply chain.

— Our policy making strategy does not include any initiatives specifically designed to ad-
vocate for policy changes to contribute to SDG 12 (either at individual or collective level).

— Chiesi shows a low level of risk in negatively affecting or inhibiting SDG 12.
