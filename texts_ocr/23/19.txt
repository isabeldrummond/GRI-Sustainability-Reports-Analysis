“First of all, a big THANK YOU goes to everyone! A double-digit achievement we
should all be proud of. | would once again like to thank everyone at Chiesi for
their concerted effort which has enabled the company to generate a turnover
of almost €2 billion - an outstanding performance which represents an impor-
tant milestone in the process of our Group's expansion and internationalisa-

tion.” Ugo di Francesco, CEO.

Among the main highlights of 2019, we would like to remark:

— the acquisition of a drug indicated for the treatment of iron overload in
patients affected by thalassemia major, with the closing phase taking place

in January 2020;

— the buyback of a joint venture in China, as the result of a concerted team

effort put in by the various functions involved in the project;
— the Chiesi Australia Affiliate set up following an acquisition;

— the in-license of a drug indicated for LHON treatment - a mitochondrial
neurodegenerative disease - from a Swiss specialty pharmaceutical company

(Santhera Pharmaceuticals);
