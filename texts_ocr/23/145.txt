Note on Methodology

This third Sustainability Report from
Chiesi Group (Chiesi) provides for our
stakeholders a clear picture of our acti-
vities and our impact on sustainability.
In it, we describe our initiatives and the
positive impacts that we achieved in
2019 (reporting period: 1 January to 31
December 2019) as well as the strug-
gles we are facing. In accordance with
our legal status of Benefit Corporation,
also the Impact Report 2020 is inclu-
ded in this document.

This report has been prepared in ac-
cordance with the GRI Standards:
Core option.

Data and indicators reported in this
document have been chosen from a
variety of economic, social, and envi-
ronmental factors that are most signi-
ficant for Chiesi’s business and Chiesi’s
stakeholders.

With regard to the financial data, the
scope of reporting corresponds to
that of Chiesi’s consolidated financial
statement. Regarding the qualitative
and quantitative data on social and
environmental aspects, the scope of
reporting corresponds to Chiesi and
its subsidiaries consolidated on a li-
ne-by-line basis in the consolidated
financial statement. Any exception,
with regard to the scope of this data,
is clearly indicated throughout the
Sustainability Report. Moreover, data
and information related to initiatives
of the Chiesi Foundation have been
reported in the chapter “Corporate
Citizenship”, even if the Foundation is
not included in the scope of the Con-
solidated Financial Statement. The
Foundation represents an important
element of the Group strategy in the

social area; therefore, the inclusion of

this information guarantees a comple-
te representation of the social impact
produced by the Group.

In November 2019, the Group comple-
ted the acquisition of the Australian
Company Emerge Health PTY and its
subsidiary operating in New Zealand.
Further to that, the company Chie-
si S.A. operating in Switzerland has
been integrated in the consolidation’s
perimeter due to the growth of its
business. We did not experience any
other significant change concerning
the organization's size, structure, ow-
nership, or supply chain.

Unless otherwise indicated, data and
information contained in this Report
refer to the year 2019. However, in or-
der to facilitate an evaluation of the
ongoing trend of the activity, the data
and information related to the previous
year, if available, are reported for com-
parative purposes. Any restatements
of data and figures published in the
previous Sustainability Report is clear-
ly indicated throughout the document.
In order to provide the most accurate
representation of performance and to
ensure that the data are reliable, direct-
ly measurable quantities have been
included while limiting, as far as pos-
sible, the use of estimates. Any figure
that has been estimated is indicated
as such; moreover, certain totals in the
tables shown in this document may
not add up due to rounding.

As regards the frequency of publica-
tion, reporting will be annual.

As regards the frequency of publi-
