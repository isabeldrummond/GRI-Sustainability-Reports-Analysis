Lowering the impact on the biosphere is the result
of a comprehensive plan of actions that the group
is implementing. The main initiatives that ran in

2019 are described below.

e We started to measure the carbon
footprint of our products. What can't
be measured can't be improved, so
to make a significant step towards
reaching the net zero emissions goal
in 2035 we developed a tool able to
measure the carbon footprint of our
pMDI and DPI products manufactured
in Italy, with a life cycle assessment
from cradle to grave. AS a company
with a strong focus on R&D, we want
to use these results to drive sustai-
nable product development. We star-
ted from our most relevant products,
the inhalation medicines for the tre-
atment of chronic respiratory condi-
tions, that have the largest impact
on the environment because of the
GWP (Global Warming Potential) of

the propellant, as well of the highest
production volumes. The carbon fo-
otprint systematic approach is certi-
fied by Certiquality according to ISO
14067 standard and has been “peer
reviewed” by Carbon Trust, which has
acknowledged the substantial com-
pliance with the adopted process.

As an example, the table below shows
how the carbon footprint of a speci-
fic pMDI (pressurised Metered Dose
Inhaler) product is composed, from
upstream (raw materials, device and
packaging purchasing) to core (raw
materials, device and packaging tran-
sportation, energy and water consu-
mption, waste as well as air emissions
from the manufacturing process) and

downstream (use and end of life).
