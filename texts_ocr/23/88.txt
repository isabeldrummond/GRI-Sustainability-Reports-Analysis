Actively and positively contributing to both the
European and the international agenda is the result
of a comprehensive plan of actions that the Group
is implementing. The main initiatives that ran in

2019 are described below.

e Chiesi_is proud to represent the
European Confederation of Pharma-
ceutical Entrepreneurs as a member
of the Policy Board of the European
Joint Programme on Rare Diseases
(EJP RD). We believe in a collabora-
tive and effective use of data and
resources to speed-up the research
in finding cures for rare diseases,
so as to dramatically decrease pa-
tients’ suffering. As one of the 130
institutions from 35 countries, as
members of the EJP RD programme
we actively contribute to two main
goals: to improve the integration
and social impact of research on
rare diseases through a European/
world-wide sharing of research and
clinical data and know-how; and to
further develop an efficient model
of financial support for all types of

research on rare diseases.

e@ We support #SHOWLEADERSHIP:
a_patient-led_ campaign aiming to
raise awareness and support 200
million European people affected by

allergy and airways diseases. Allergy
and asthma are major, widely preva-

lent chronic diseases, affecting more
than 200 Million Europeans. They are
the most common diseases in chil-
dren, often lasting a lifetime. The he-
althcare costs of asthma in Europe
alone amount to 72.2 billion annual-
ly. Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) is the third leading

cause of death in the world among

adults over 45. This is why, at Chiesi,
along with other partners, we sup-
port the #ShowLeadership campaign
that brings together the motivation
of patients, carers, healthcare pro-
fessionals and decision-makers to
overcome the situation, to make the
difference on prevention and care of

allergy, asthma and COPD.

e We want to empower the members
of the European Parliament to act

on behalf of patients when needed.
Despite the facts and figures, asthma

and respiratory diseases are often
dismissed as “second-class” dise-
ases. For this reason, for years, EFA
(European Federation of Allergy and
Airways Diseases Patients’ Associa-
tions) has been running the secreta-
riat of the EP Interest Group on Aller-
gy and Asthma, with the objective of
raising awareness and putting the-
se diseases high in the EU political
agenda. In 2019, new events in the
European Parliament were organised
involving members of the EP, EU Of-
ficial and international bodies such
as the WHO (World Health Organiza-
tion), in order to continue to raise the
profile of asthma and respiratory con-

ditions in the political agenda.
