continue the promotion of awareness campaigns, raising awareness of COPD

and of the physical and social challenges that patients face on a daily basis.

> Diversity & Inclusion

After the creation of the Diversity Committee, we now want to plan and
consolidate strategies for managing and enhancing diversity throughout the
Chiesi Group. In particular, we want to implement a specific action plan on
Diversity & Inclusion issues, together with a review of the current composition of
the Diversity Committee, in order to extend its participation to a greater number
of corporate functions and colleagues within the Group.

A special focus, for 2020, will be dedicated to the gender pay gap, with the
aim of monitoring the issue on an annual basis and implementing possible
corrective actions through the launch of a dedicated body which will involve our

top management.

civic value, that can have a positive impact on our community.

Chiesi's commitment to this purpose of common benefit in 2019 includes the

following actions:

the support of lonely elderly people who have been discharged from the hospital
and are facing the difficulties of life post-hospitalisation. The project is promoted
and financed by Chiesi and it represents a model of partnership between the
public, private and non-profit organisations, responding to the needs of a specific
and vulnerable target population.

The project, which started as a pilot in 2019, includes the creation of a service point
at the Hospital of Parma, in connection with the existing community points in the
area. Through the training of dedicated volunteers and the involvement of Parma’s
NGO Pubblica Assistenza, it was possible to act both at home and at community
points, guaranteeing assistance to the first 15 beneficiaries of the project who
