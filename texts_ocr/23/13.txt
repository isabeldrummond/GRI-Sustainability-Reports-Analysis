Our Global Challenge:
Carbon Neutrality

We are facing a global climate emer-
gency. This is scientifically proven
and exponentially pervasive in every
aspect of our lives, affecting business

and personal habits.

At Chiesi, we recognise that we have
a responsibility as a business, and we
have committed to reducing and pre-
venting our negative environmental

impacts.

In 2019 we decided to significantly
raise the bar by adopting the commit-
ment to become carbon neutral by the
end of 2035, achieving a net zero car-

bon footprint.

It will not be an easy journey. Our
operations depend on the various ac-
tors involved in our system and value
chain, being them suppliers, partners,
distributors, institutions, and many
others. All these actors contribute to
our carbon footprint at different le-

vels. Technology within this sector

 

has developed exponentially in recent
years and continues to do so, however
we realise that there is still progress
to be made in this field. Nevertheless,
we have committed to this ambitious
target because every business and
every individual has the capacity and
the duty to make a difference.

Our company has already made a big
step in this direction. We announced
at the United Nations Climate Chan-
ge Conference (COP25) our plan to
bring to market, by the end of 2025, a
breakthrough, carbon minimal pMDI
inhaler for patients with asthma and
chronic obstructive pulmonary dise-
ase (COPD). Currently, pMDI inhalers
account for a negligible proportion
of total emissions, but we are com-
mitted to leading the way towards
carbon minimal pMDI solutions that
maintain the necessary array of thera-
peutic solutions for patients. This is a
first fundamental step in our journey

of systematically reducing emissions

at global scale.
