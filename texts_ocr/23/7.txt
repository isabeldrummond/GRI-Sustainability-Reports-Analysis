Before we get Started

At Chiesi Group we take the reporting process seriously, going beyond mere
legal requirements. We believe that transparency is a fundamental component
of our company’s management process and an opportunity to benchmark
ourselves against international standards, and that a final report is a practical
tool to represent our business’ impact.

This report is the result of an extensive collaborative process.

As a B Corp and Benefit Corporation, we are committed to measuring our
social and environmental impact with the same accuracy we use to measure
our economic results and performance. We are also committed to sharing our
work with responsibility, not only in terms of the positive results achieved, but
also in terms of the difficulties we encounter and the challenges that hinder our
evolution process. In the sustainability report 2019, we have integrated some
important features and reporting frameworks:

— the structure of the report is in line with the four dimensions for thinking com-
prehensively about business alignment with the SDGs, proposed by Professor
Jeffrey Sachs: products, processes, global value chain, and corporate citizen-
ship (Columbia Center on Sustainable Development, Aligning Corporations with
the Sustainable Development Goals, Summary of Conference Proceedings, No-
vember 2019).

— in correlation with these dimensions, the purposes of common benefit that
Chiesi chose to pursue as a Benefit Corporation, as well as the related actions
undertaken to contribute to their achievement.

— the analysis and measurement of the performance according to a multidi-
mensional approach based on the integrated use of the most robust measure-
ment and reporting frameworks: GRI Standards (Global Reporting Initiative),
B Impact Assessment of B Lab, SDGs of the UN (United Nations).

— the use of a SDGs impact measurement tool, called the SDG Action Manager,
made available in January 2020 by UNGC (United Nations Global Compact) and
B Lab. Chiesi was involved, together with other 70 other companies across the
world, in the testing phase during 2019.

— the identification and analysis of the positive effects generated on society and
the environment by our organisation, as central elements of our evolution path.

— the identification of the struggles and challenges we face in achieving our
sustainability goals.

Finally, in our constant commitment to the creation of a report inspired by
maximum transparency and utility for the reader, we ask you to send us your
feedback, your advice, and your most authentic impressions to help us improve
in the narration of our activity. csr@chiesi.com
