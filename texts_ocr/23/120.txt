in order to ensure the dissemination of sustainability values and principles
among our people, given their importance for our business. In 2019, we reached

a participation rate of 70% of Chiesi Group employees.

Our commitments for 2020
Below is a description of the commitment planned for 2020 aimed at achieving

the purpose of common benefit described in this section.

> Involvement of patients in our processes

Including the voice and perspectives of our patients in our processes and in the
development of our drugs is the approach we try to adopt in our daily activities.
In 2020, we want to carry out more structured stakeholder engagement activities
with our patients, listening to their experiences, understanding their lifestyles
and integrating their suggestions. This represents our shared value approach
and will allow the co-creation of innovative solutions, developed around their

specific needs.

> Implementation of the Code of Interdependence among our suppliers
The implementation of the Code of Interdependence will take place gradually
throughout the year in the supplier qualification and evaluation processes. In
addition to the code, these processes integrate, by design, further sustainability
principles. Furthermore, the Code of Interdependence will be the baseline of the
supplier audit plan. In 2020 we will therefore start implementing the Code of
Interdependence with our strategic suppliers.

General Purpose of
Common Benefit and Impact
Assessment

As a Benefit Corporation, Chiesi is committed to pursuing, in addition to the
economic objectives of its business activity, the purposes of common benefit.
We are committed to operating in a responsible, sustainable and transparent
manner towards people, communities, territories and the environment, to
cultural and social assets and to activities, bodies and associations and other
stakeholders.

In order to comply with legal requirements and to report the impact generated
by the company, Chiesi uses the third-party standard B Impact Assessment,
the assessment tool that underpins B Corp certification.

The impact assessment for the year 2019 and related to the Italian perimeter
resulted in a score of 91.8 points, measured with version 6 of the B Impact
Assessment made available from April 2019. There was a small reduction
in the score of about 2 points compared to the measurement of 2018 due
to the new "major release" of the assessment tool which modified some key
