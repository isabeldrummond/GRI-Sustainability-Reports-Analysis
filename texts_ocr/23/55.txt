The Struggles we are Facing

We pledge to net zero by 2035.

 

This means becoming able to mea-
sure and reduce as much as possible
all our CO, emissions, both the direct
(those we directly own and control —
Scope 1) and indirect (those coming
from the energy provision — Scope 2),
as well as those from the supply chain
or sources not directly owned or con-
trolled by the company (Scope 3).

Now, we face two challenges. First,
while for our direct emissions we
can use existing tools to measure
our impact, scope 3 presents grea-
ter difficulties in defining the proper
perimeter of action and gathering the
data to measure the carbon footprint
effectively. Secondly, the commit-
ment is long term. We need to ensure
a high level of attention and engage-
ment throughout the years to come,
fine tuning our strategy according
to the development of new techno-
logies and global strategies that will
be adopted not only by our sector but

also by business at a global scale.

Quantifying and reducing the sour-

ces of waste in industrial processes
can be difficult.

Industrial processes in the pharma-

ceutical sector are extremely com-

plex and related to one another.
Quantifying how and where in the
process waste is produced is of ut-
most importance for its minimisa-
tion and reduction of its impact on

the biosphere.

Green chemistry principles are not
always adoptable.
The pharmaceutical industry is a uni-

que territory and companies need to
comply with the industry's stringent
requirements. As of today, it is still
not always technically possible to
substitute some chemical substan-
ces while maintaining unchanged
profiles of quality, safety, efficacy

and economics of the products.

It is hard to have direct control to the
whole life-cycle of products.

In particular, it is difficult to ensu-
re that the sustainability principles
are applied especially in the end of
life phase and thus in their disposal,
since this does not directly depend
on the company’s practices. For this
reason the involvement of key sta-
keholders, such as patients, pharma-
cies and disposal services, in essen-
tial on this topic and for our future

initiatives.
