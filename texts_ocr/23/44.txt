Focus: Product Quality and
Reliability and Patients’ Safety

To ensure the best treatment for our
patients, we are committed to the
highest standards of quality, safety,
and reliability of our products. We are
highly focused on innovation and the
fulfilment of our customers’ expecta-
tions, while maintaining strict adheren-
ce to regulatory requirements. Chiesi
applies a global approach to the safety
of our products to ensure a consistent
standard of high quality across the
company.

Because Chiesi engages with multiple
stakeholders, providing a high-quality
product means delivering a range of
specific expectations:

— Our patients have specific medical
needs

— Healthcare professionals focus their
expectations on product efficacy and
safety

— Pharmaceutical regulatory agencies
monitor consistency of operations, ad-
dressing product safety, efficacy, and
purity, as well as compliance of pro-
duction process with regulatory requi-
rements and industry standards.

Given the high level of diversification
in our product portfolio, we implement
different manufacturing strategies to
guarantee the greatest level of quality
in our production process. All of our
products are produced in accordance
with European (e.g. Good manufactu-
ring practices) and international stan-
dards (e.g. US FDA, Sino FDA, Brazilian
ANVISA), in sites authorised by the re-
levant national and international regu-
latory bodies.

Our plants are constantly subject to
inspections and assessments to veri-
fy compliance with current legislation
and internal regulations. We also per-
form periodic self-inspections to main-
tain a high-quality control system.
Drug safety monitoring is an essential
element of the effective use of medici-
nes and high-quality medical care.
Patients’ safety is a fundamental requi-
site for all Chiesi products, and to ensu-
re it, we rely on our pharmacovigilance
and quality policies which are applied
to all company personnel directly or in-
directly involved in this process.

The global approach to patients’ safety
is also driven by a proactive approach
to continuous improvement, according
to the principles expressed in the gui-
delines released by the European Medi-
cine Agency (i.e. Good Pharmacovigi-
lance Practices), National Competent
Authorities, and by the International
Conference on Harmonization of Tech-
nical Requirements for Registration of
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ht-
tps://www.ich.org/home.html).

The pharmacovigilance system is ai-
med at monitoring the benefit-risk pro-
file of the medicinal products, ensuring
liability and appropriate action when
necessary for products both marke-
ted or under clinical development. In
addition, all information relevant to the
benefit-risk profile of our products is
fully and promptly reported to the ap-
propriate authorities and to other con-
cerned receivers in accordance with

the current legislation.
