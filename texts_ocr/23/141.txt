Energy intensity

po 2018

 

Energy intensity (GJ / mln eq. units) 2,386 2,649

Energy intensity related to production processes is calculated considering the energy con-
sumption of the production plants divided by the production volume (reported as million
of Equivalent Units produced). The production sites considered are: Blois, Santana de Par-
naiba, Parma (Via Palermo-Via San Leonardo).

GHG Protocol definition: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions come from sources (physical units or

rocesses that release GHG into the atmosphere) that are owned or controlled by the organi-
sation. Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions include, but are not limited to, the CO2 emissions from
the fuel consumption. Energy Indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions result from the generation of
urchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed by the organisation.
Methodology:
Scope 1 emission coefficient data for natural gas, diesel, gasoline, bioethanol and LPG were
calculated using DEFRA (Department for Environment Food Rural Affairs,
UK, 2019) data as source for emission factors (expressed in tCO2 equivalent).
The GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, in accordance with the GHG Protocol, include two
methodologies for calculating Scope 2 emissions, the “Location-based” approach and the “Mar-

ket-based” approach. The “Location-based” approach provides for the use of a national average
emission factor related to the specific national energy mix for the production of electricity (Sour-

ce: Terna, Confronti Internazionali 2016). The “Market-based” approach contemplates the use
of an emission factor defined on a contractual basis with the electricity supplier. Given the pre-
sence of specific contractual agreements between some Affiliates of the Group and the electri-
city supplier (purchase of certificates of Guarantee of Origin), this approach foresees the use of
the emission actors relating to the national “residual mix”, without considering that electricity
purchased from renewable sources (Source: Association of Issuing Bodies, European Residual
Mixes 2018). When the “residual mix” emission factors is not available (for countries outside the
EU), the factor of location based method has been used.

Scope 2 emissions are expressed in tCO2, the amount of CH4 and NO2 (percentage) has a not
significant effect on the overall GHG emissions (CO2.) as deductible from technical literature.
Scope 3 emissions include emissions from employees’ own private vehicles used for commer-
cial activities, business travels (only for Italy - Chiesi Farmaceutici, Brazil, France, Germany, Mexi-
co, Netherlands, UK and USA) and primary logistics. Emission coefficient data were calculated
using DEFRA (Department for Environment Food Rural Affairs, UK, 2019).
