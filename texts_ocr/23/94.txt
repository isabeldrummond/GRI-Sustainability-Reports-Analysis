Background

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a

set of 17 objectives, launched in 2015 by the United
Nations, as part of a comprehensive strategic plan,
the 2030 Agenda. The objectives represent the global
challenges identified by the UN as targets to be
achieved by 2030 to ensure a sustainable future of
shared prosperity.

The SDGs are deeply interconnected and their
progress over time is monitored through a system of
169 Targets and over 240 indicators. The objectives
have been developed by adopting a multidimensional
approach which takes into account economic, social,
and environmental dimensions, as well as the 10
founding principles of the Global Compact, in order to
formulate the 17 final goals towards which to strive.

The 10 founding principles of the Global Compact

Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of
internationally proclaimed human rights;

Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;

Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;

occupation.
