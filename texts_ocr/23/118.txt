were in situations of temporary difficulty. The partnership of the project involves
several stakeholders including Chiesi, Centro Servizi Volontariato Emilia (Forum

Solidarieta), Parma WelFARE, Fondazione Asphi and Parma Pubblica Assistenza.

2. Volunteer programme

Since 2015 we have promoted the Chiesi Volunteering Week during which Chiesi
employees can donate their time to local non-profit associations. There are
different local versions of this commitment across our affiliates, with country-
specific solidarity initiatives.

In 2019, with the launch of the Volunteering Month initiative, promoted at our
Headquarters, 620 volunteer employees were involved in projects regarding
environmental protection, multiculturalism and interculturalism, the fight

against poverty and support for the most vulnerable groups in our community.

3. Collaboration with the Teatro Regio

The Teatro Regio, built during the first half of the 1800s, is the opera house
of Parma with national and international relevance. For years Chiesi has been
collaborating with the Fondazione Teatro Regio, which aims to spread the
culture of performing arts, professional artistic and technical training and
musical education, in order to preserve and enhance the historical and cultural
heritage linked in particular to opera, dance and music in general. In 2019, we
continued our collaboration by economically contributing to the activities of the
Fondazione Teatro Regio, promoting them also among our employees living in
the community of Parma. The various activities include the Verdi Festival, the

opera season, Parma Danza, Regio Young and Barezzi festival.

Our commitments for 2020
Below is a description of the commitment planned for 2020 aimed at achieving

the purpose of common benefit described in this section.

> Parma 2020

In 2020 Parma will be the Italian Capital of Culture. In October 2018, the Committee
for Parma 2020, founded by the Municipality of Parma, "Parma io ci sto!" and UPI -
Unione Parmense degli Industriali, was established with the aim of supporting the
implementation of the activities and objectives included in the candidature dossier
of the city as Italian Capital of Culture, strengthening public-private collaboration
and developing an approach that will continue beyond 2020. Chiesi's partnership
with the city for the Capital of Culture year is part of the company's commitment
to actively contribute to the social and cultural development of its community and
in particular to contribute to the development of Parma as a cultural and attractive

area for citizens, workers and tourists.

> No Longer Alone Project (“Progetto Non Pit Soli”)
The pilot project carried out during 2019 has brought positive results. Therefore,
in 2020 we want to expand the project and provide the service to an increasing

number of elderly people in need.
