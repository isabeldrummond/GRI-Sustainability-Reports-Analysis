Our Purpose: Why we are

in Business

“We aim to offer patients innovative solutions to solve
their needs, through a fully sustainable and evolved

business model”

Chiesi was born in 1935 when Gia-
como Chiesi, a chemist and the
founder of the company, opened
his small laboratory in Parma, Italy.
As the company expanded, it faced
many internal and external challen-
ges including the Second World War
that destroyed parts of the buildin-
gs. But this did not deter the ambi-
tious researcher. Rather it solidified
his calling to find and develop novel
therapeutic solutions for the health
of the population, growing the com-
pany not only in size but also in re-
silience, and continuously adapting
to the changes of the context. Today
Chiesi is proud to have grown into 29
Affiliates operating around the wor-
Id with 3 manufacturing sites and 5
research centres.

Just as our 85-year old heritage con-
tinues to guide us, we are still able
to recognise the changes in the wor-
Id and not only adapt to the current
challenges but also to actively con-
tribute in a positive way, adopting
an approach that is consistent with
the nature of our business: to care
for people and the society and to
make the world feel better.

We are aware that we live in an
ecosystem where economic, social
and environmental factors are inter-

twined and interdependent. There
cannot be a sustainable future if we
don't take this into account. With
this in mind, the concept of health
acquires a broader meaning for our
company as we commit to achie-
ving a fully sustainable business
model, acting as a force for good by
creating shared value: contributing
to the health of people and of the
planet, while continuing to grow as

a company.

The Benefit Corporation model was
introduced in 2010 in the United
States. In January 2016, Italy beca-
me the first country outside of the
US to introduce the model. In 2018,
we became a Benefit Corporation,
adopting a new legal form under the
Italian (Law no. 208/2015) and US'
law, by revising the Articles of In-
corporation and including, together
with the objective of generating
profits for shareholders, the additio-
nal objectives of creating a positive
impact on our patients, people, par-
tners, the environment and the com-
munities in which we operate. This
approach creates value for multiple
stakeholders, in addition to provi-
ding financial returns to the sha-
reholders. Benefit Corporations are
the expression of an evolved vision

and incorporate a double-purpose
