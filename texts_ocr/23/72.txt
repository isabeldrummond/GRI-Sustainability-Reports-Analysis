The Struggles we are Facing

Supporting suppliers in fully com-

 

mitting to the B Corp values requi-

 

res time. We share our experience,
knowledge and values around envi-
ronmental and social practices and
standards with our suppliers in order
to ensure the alignment of our appro-
aches. However, we understand the
integration of sustainable principles
also requires time to absorb new va-
lues and activate change in contexts
which can be different in terms of
size, history and core business. This
is one of the challenges we face and
requires redesigning the engage-
ment of our stakeholders. Nonethe-
less, this approach also requires a
continuous dialogue which can bring
new opportunities from the encoun-

ter of diverse realities.

Measuring the environmental_and
social impact of direct suppliers is

major challenge in the pharma sector.
The ideal global value chain can as-

sess the impact of both direct and
indirect suppliers on sustainability
criteria. Today, we are only able to

assess indirect suppliers - those who

provide services or secondary ma-
terials. However, we want to extend
our process of mapping, analysis
and evaluation to also include direct
suppliers - those who are responsi-
ble for the production and supply of
raw materials and ingredients. In the
pharma sector, supplies are strongly
regulated, applying new criteria to
the acquisition and use of materials
is therefore difficult; they are under
strict and standardised control and

changes can take years.

Adopting the interdependence ap-
proach with other key players in the
value chain. In 2019, the main sta-
keholders involved, in terms of inte-
gration of sustainability principles,
were our suppliers. From now on, we
believe we will gradually be able to
adopt this model along our entire va-
lue chain. We have already started to
work in other areas such as distribu-
tors, logistics, business partners, as
well as Merger & Acquisition proce-
dures, where sustainability has also
been integrated into due diligence

processes.
