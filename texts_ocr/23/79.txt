buted to our stakeholders, and how
much has been retained by the com-
pany. The total economic value gene-

"Following the London Benchmarking Group methodology for community investment
calculation, 2018 figures have been restated according to the new approach. The restate-
ment impacts the “Community” and the “Suppliers/vendors” line. For previous values of
the economic value generated and distributed please refer to 2018 Sustainability Report.
Value distributed to community (17.88M€ in 2019 and 11.30M€ in 2018) refers to dona-
tions and expenses with social purposes such as: congresses expenses, sponsorship,
External Clinical Scientific Test & Studies. Dividends considered are the ones distributed
within the reference year but related to the profit of the previous year.
