@ We reduced CO, emissions.

The first step to achieving Carbon
Neutrality is to reduce emissions. We
mapped emissions of scope 1 and 2
as well as scope 3 for primary logisti-
cs and business travels. We are cur-
rently analysing the material elemen-
ts to define the relevant perimeter of
scope 3 emissions. In the meantime,
we made a giant leap in the use of

energy from certified renewable

sources in our Headquarters, with
progressive extension to our affilia-
tes. We chose transportation com-
panies committed to minimise their
environmental footprint and who are
able to calculate their approximative
amount of CO,. Examples are the use
of Euro 5/6 trucks, eco-friendly airli-
nes or the switch to maritime ship-
ping. We have optimised business

travelling, producing less CO,.

®GHG Protocol definition: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions come from sources (physical

units or processes that release GHG into the atmosphere) that are owned or controlled by
the organisation. Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions include, but are not limited to, the CO2

emissions from the fuel consumption. Energy Indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions result
from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam con-
sumed by the organisation. Details on methodology and conversation factors are explai-
ned in the Annexes (p. 142’

While we are currently developing an analysis of the perimeter of the scope 3
emissions, material to our business model, we have started to measure some of

our scope 3 emissions within our current capacity.

 

Scope 3 already measured:
Emissions from Primary logistics*: 4,005 tonnes CO,,

Emissions from Business Travels": 8,717 tonnes CO,

°Primary logistics includes all finished goods movements, under Chiesi responsibility,
from Chiesi production plants to Warehouses and Distribution Centres

°Only countries that use DEFRA methodology calculation
