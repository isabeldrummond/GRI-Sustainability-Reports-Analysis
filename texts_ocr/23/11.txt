pathologies, rare diseases and other
health conditions which are difficult to
treat. We commit to offering patients,
and those who take care of them, in-

of their needs, even exploring new
frontiers in treatment and care.

As a family-controlled company, we
want to continue to grow sustainably
by focusing on key markets such as
the US and Europe, but also expan-

emerging countries like China. We
aim to maintain a profitability level

promote a working environment that
welcomes everyone's contribution
