Specific purpose of common
benefit (ID):

Positive impact on people and patients, with the
aim of improving their health, well-being and qua-
lity of life.

What we did in 2019
Chiesi's commitment in relation to this purpose of common benefit regarded the

implementation of the following actions:

1. Research and Development Expenditure

Improving people's health and quality of life is our vocation. For this reason,
we believe that investing in Research and Development (R&D) is necessary to
promote the discovery of innovative therapeutic solutions to tackle those diseases
for which, despite scientific progress, the medical need remains high, such as
chronic respiratory diseases, diseases due to neonatal prematurity, rare diseases
and special care. In 2019, our R&D (Research & Development) expenditure
amounted to 19% of our revenues, of which 38.2% was spent in neonatology, rare
diseases and special care, with a particular focus on innovative therapies and
services. Chiesi ranks first among Italian pharmaceutical companies, second
among Italian manufacturing companies and fourteenth among European

pharmaceutical companies for investments in research"®.

2. Training in Neonatology

Consistent with Chiesi's commitment to promoting scientific progress also
through medical training, in 2019 more than 20 of the Group's affiliates organised
neonatology training events targeting healthcare professionals around the
world. The training programmes took place in various countries of the European
Union, the United States, China and emerging countries, with more than 450

training sessions and a total of 27,000 healthcare professionals involved.

Many topics of great relevance to clinical practice were covered, such as
respiratory support, infant stabilisation in delivery rooms, ventilation techniques
and less invasive methods of surfactant administration for infants with

Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

Another important pilot programme was carried out in Pakistan, where one of
Chiesi Group's affiliates is present. The programme aimed to train 20 nurses
working in neonatal intensive care units. The project is of particular value
in light of the socio-economic condition of the country, which currently has
the highest neonatal mortality rate in the world and where the improvement
of neonatal care standards requires particular attention in a joint effort by

government and industry.
