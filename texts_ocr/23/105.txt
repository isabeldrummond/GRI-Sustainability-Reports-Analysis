Takeaways:

— We have a formal commitment to align our business with the Paris Agreement
and measure progress towards it. At the same time, we recognise that our bu-
siness model does not have a direct positive impact in taking urgent action to

combat climate change and its impacts.

— Our internal operations are on the right trajectory but with important steps yet
to be taken. We need to encourage the purchase of energy from low-impact re-
newable sources. Our achievements in lowering the carbon intensity for Scope
1 and 2 were rewarded, together with the recognition of the progress made in
managing Scope 3. Our pledge to meet carbon neutrality by 2035 has undoubtedly
contributed to this result and represents the starting point to align all strategic
directions to one main objective.

Scope 3 includes the management of greenhouse gas emissions produced by
the supply chain, therefore our 2035 plan will ensure further steps are taken in

tracking and managing our suppliers CO, emissions.
— Our policy making strategy does not include any initiatives specifically designed
to advocate for policy changes to contribute to SDG 13 (either at individual or

collective level).

— Chiesi shows a low level of risk in negatively affecting or inhibiting SDG 13.
