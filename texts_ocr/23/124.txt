— to equip themselves with a governance that allows them to manage the
company as a force for regeneration of society and the biosphere.

The legal form of Benefit Corporation has created a new role that serves to
transform the company from within: the person responsible for the impact is the
person entrusted, in agreement with the management, with the task of ensuring
that the company, in carrying out its activities, also aims to have a positive
impact on people, society and the environment, and pursues the purposes of

common benefit declared in its articles of association.

In measuring their impacts, Benefit Corporations use a_ technological
measurement platform, the B Impact Assessment (BIA) developed by the non-
profit B Lab. This protocol, available for free online worldwide, allows companies
to measure whether they create more value than they destroy, i.e. whether it is
regenerative. If a given company, by measuring all of its economic, environmental
and social impacts through the BIA protocol, exceeds a threshold of excellence
of 80 points, verified by the B Lab Standards Trust on a scale from 0 to 200,
then it is eligible to be B Corp Certified. Certified B Corp are the companies that,
worldwide, are committed to spreading more advanced business paradigms
and have promoted, since 2006, the legal form of Benefit Corporation / Societa

Benefit throughout the world.

The thousands of B Corps and the 120,000 companies that use them, across
71 countries and 150 industries, represent a concrete, positive and scalable
solution that creates value for both shareholders and stakeholders. One of
the fundamental principles of the B Corp values is interdependence, i.e. co-
responsibility among B Corps, responsibility towards all stakeholders and future
generations. Currently, in Italy, there are about 100 certified B Corps and over

400 Benefit Corporations, the fastest growing community in the world.
