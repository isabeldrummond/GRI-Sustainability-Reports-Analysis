Corporate
Citizenshi

   

 

 

 

Corporate Citizenship is the recognition that a corporation has economic, so-
cial, cultural and environmental responsibilities to the community in which it
seeks a licence to operate. Such as any citizenship, it is made up of rights and
duties. Inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we de-
veloped our Corporate Citizenship through internal corporate governance practi-

ces in place within our company.

Through our Corporate Citizenship we commit to achieving several positive effects:
— Having a positive impact on the territory

— Increasing the transparency and ethical practices of business

— Actively and positively contributing to European and international Agenda

To ensure that these commitments are secured through the years to come, we
made Chiesi a Benefit Corporation and inserted in our Statute this specific pur-

pose of common benefit:

“The contribution to the development of the local communities in which the

company operates.”
