for the people working on these processes. The policy is based on fundamental
aspects for the management of the issue, such as providing information to the
stakeholders involved, the substitution of certain substances whenever possible
through innovative solutions and process optimisation, and the commitment to
a Life Cycle Perspective approach regarding the impact of our products both

on health, safety and the environment. The policy is published on our website

Our commitments for 2020
Below is a description of the commitments for 2020, pursuing the common
benefit purpose described in this section, in continuity with the activities

undertaken in 2019, with a particular focus on Carbon Neutrality.

> Towards Carbon Neutrality

For 2020, we will develop an action plan to achieve Carbon Neutrality, ie. net
zero carbon footprint by 2035, in relation to Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope
2 (indirect emissions mainly due to electricity purchase) and Scope 3 (other
indirect emissions). The main aspects of the plan in 2020 will be the analysis
of the scope materiality of other indirect emissions and the use of energy from

renewable sources.

> Energy efficiency of our buildings
The energy efficiency efforts will be the base of the certification of our Energy

Management System according to the international standard ISO 50001.

> The new Headquarters with high environmental and social standards
We aim to obtain a recognition of high environmental and social standards for

our new Headquarters in Parma by obtaining the Leed Gold v.4 certification.

> Animal Welfare

Aware of the fundamental role and contribution that animals have in drug
development, Chiesi promotes the highest ethical standards, acting to ensure
maximum respect for the health and care of experimental animals. In our scientific
research, animal testing is a very limited part of the work and is only carried out when
there are no viable alternatives to ensure the safety and efficacy of our products.
These tests are necessary and mandatory to process the pre-clinical data to be
submitted to regulatory authorities such as the FDA (Food and Drug Administration)
and the EMA (European Medicines Agency) and to obtain authorisation to proceed
with human studies, and then receive the final product's approval.

The scientific community around the world agrees that while it is desirable to
replace animal testing with alternative methods, animal testing continues to be
necessary to protect human, environmental and animal health.

In 2020 we want to begin the AAALAC (Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) accreditation process, one of the
most internationally recognised bodies in good animal use and care practices,

in addition to compliance with local and national regulations.
