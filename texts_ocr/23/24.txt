Chronic respiratory
diseases

Chiesi has been developing medicines
to treat respiratory diseases for more
than 30 years, pursuing an improved
patient experience, patient choice,
and clinical efficacy and safety.
Chiesi is highly committed to impro-
ving the quality of life for patients
suffering from chronic respiratory
diseases, such as asthma and Chro-
nic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD), by targeting the underlying
pathophysiological conditions such
as tissue inflammation and airway
constriction, which are typical cha-
racteristics of such diseases.
Adherence to treatment regimens is
central to a patient's benefit, and this
is especially true in the treatment
of these chronic respiratory disor-
ders. Our patient-focused approach
is therefore also aimed at ensuring
improved treatment adherence and
clinical outcomes. We target this
objective with a dual approach: the
use of a combination of medicamen-
ts and their effective delivery to the
target organ (the lung). The intro-
duction of combination treatments
not only helps patients to achieve
better clinical outcomes using only
one device, but also greatly reduces
the environmental impact compared
with the same drugs delivered throu-
gh separate multiple inhalers. Chiesi
has been successful in progressing
the patient-access to both our dual
and triple inhaled combination treat-
ments for patients with asthma and
COPD across the world. As a result,

we are continuously developing our

range of devices to ensure they are
safe and effective, and environmen-
tally-friendly.

From the early beginnings of the Mon-
treal Protocol in 1990, Chiesi was
among the first to openly support the
phasing out of the production of sub-
stances responsible for ozone deple-
tion, abandoning chlorofluorocarbon
(CFC) propellants used in pressuri-
zed metered dose inhalers (pMDI)
to move to hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)
propellant.

Even today, with new technologies
developing rapidly, we are proud to be
at the forefront of device innovation:
in December 2019 Chiesi announced
the first commercial agreement with
propellant gas supplier Koura, to se-
cure the supply of HFA 152a which is
classified as a low Global Warming
Potential (GWP) propellant, ten ti-
mes lower than the currently used
HFA 134a. We will work jointly with
Koura to bring to the market by the
end of 2025 a breakthrough, envi-
ronmentally friendly pMDI inhaler
for patients with asthma and COPD,
while continuing investing on our DPI
platform.

Our pMDI products now incorporate
a dose counter to enhance patient
feedback and compliance. In paral-
lel, we have continued the applica-
tion of our innovative DPI (Dry Pow-
der Inhalers) platform (NEXThaler®)
to an increasing number of novel tre-
atment options. NEXThaler® incor-
porates a number of unique, simple,
and patient-friendly use features,
and is propellant-free. Ongoing de-

velopments include the application
