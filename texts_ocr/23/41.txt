Fostering Research & Development and substantially
contributing to the scientific community is the result

of a comprehensive plan of actions that the Group is
implementing. The main initiatives that ran in 2019

are described below.

e We set up a company policy to im-
plement Clinical Trial Transparency
and Data Sharing. We developed a
portal where Chiesi clinical trial data
can be requested by external resear-
chers under specific and pre-defined
requirements. We are fully committed
to transparency in our conduct of cli-
nical trials, in accordance with EFPIA
requirements and we also want to bo-
ost transparency and collaboration, al-
lowing our community to flourish from
the process of knowledge sharing. In
accordance with the local legislative
and applicable requirements on clini-
cal studies, we also disclose in public
registries (e.g. EU Clinical Trials Re-
gister), the Clinical Protocol and Stu-
dy-related Information and the Sum-
mary Results of those clinical studies
sponsored by Chiesi Farmaceutici.
Clinical studies sponsored by Chiesi,
their publicly disclosed, study-related
and results-related information, are
made available on the Chiesi Clinical
Study Register portal in accordance
with the policy.

Chiesi also contributes to the EF-
GCP-EFPIA Roadmap Initiative to
good lay summary practices, a mul-
ti-stakeholder initiative with over 60
participating organisations, with a
focus on defining best practice guide-
lines for the implementation and dis-
semination of lay summaries aimed
to allow non-scientific communities,
including patients, to have a clear view

of studies’ details and results.

e We adopted a Life-Cycle Per-
spective in our R&D process to in-

clude sustainability criteria by de-
sign, from the very start. To ensure
that the R&D process is sustainable
at every stage, we set up a Life
Cycle Perspective tool that allows
us to evaluate the impact of our
products at all key stages of their
development, from pre-clinic to indu-
strialisation. The tool addresses two
main areas: the use of priority che-
micals and process optimisation.
For both areas, it evaluates qualitati-
ve aspects and quantitative data by
using the best available resources
on the market along with CO, calcu-
lation tools developed in house. It
also gives a clear perspective of the
actual impacts of a specific product
during a given development phase
as well as the improvement targets

that can be developed over time.

e We develop partnerships with Uni-
versities to attract a broader array
of competencies. In order to access
cutting-edge expertise and knowled-
ge in the development of new drugs
and conduction of clinical studies,
we set up ad hoc collaboration with
world-renowned international uni-
versities and academic groups.

Partnerships typically take place in
the early phases of drug discovery,
as well as during clinical studies.
Such collaborations are an example

of how we can all benefit from the
