Takeaways:
—Chiesi’s business model is specifically designed to contribute to Good Health

and Well-Being

— For the Internal operations area, which includes practices that promote SDG 3
within our own facilities, we are pleased to have achieved the highest possible

supplementary health benefits and wellness initiatives we have implemented

for our people

— We should reinforce the assessment criteria and guidelines put in place with
our suppliers to further encourage healthcare and operational health and safety

development on their side
— Although we have specific activities to advocate for positive regulatory chan-
ges, we are suggested to improve our collaboration with stakeholders to impro-

ve behaviour or performance specifically related to achieving SDG 3
