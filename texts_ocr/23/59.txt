Self-Fulfilment and wellbeing of the Chiesi

people are the result of a comprehensive plan of
actions that the Group is implementing. The main
initiatives that ran in 2019 are described below.

e We invested in people's develop-
ment.

We believe that providing profes-
sional development plans and offe-
ring training to improve individual
competencies is ultimately key to
increasing productivity. As part of
this program, we offered coaching
pathways delivered by external pro-
fessionals in the Headquarters.
These are creative processes that
inspire people to generate solutions
to maximise their professional po-
tential, develop managerial skills,
new and complex behaviours, and to
optimise performances. We are also
committed to offering fair opportu-
nities to all of our people to develop
their competencies, according to
both their attitudes (motivations and
aspiration) and business needs. To
this end, we implemented the Peo-
ple Development global initiative: to
sustain individual performance and
foster professional development at
all levels. To fulfil our commitment
to providing career development
opportunities worldwide, we ran the
2019 edition of the Chiesi Academy
program, an intensive educational
program involving colleagues from
all over the world designed and deli-
vered in partnership with the interna-
tionally acclaimed Italian business
school, SDA Bocconi.

People development programs now
cover 1,013 employees, 27% more
compared to 2018; and 8 coaching
pathways have been delivered in the

Headquarters.

e We designed a programme aiming
to raise awareness among Chiesi
employees on sustainability issues

and mobilise them to take action.
Without correct and widespread know-
ledge, we cannot act responsibly in
our everyday business. We ACT Edu-
cational is a training programme de-
dicated to sustainability topics with
specific training courses on values,
principles and practices. These cour-
ses review the basics of environmen-
tal and social sustainability, and refer
to the United Nations Sustainable De-
velopment Goals, the B Corp and Be-
nefit Corporation frameworks, and to
our sustainability strategic plan. This
training project was launched throu-
ghout the Chiesi Group to ensure an
alignment on sustainability values and
principles among our people. 70% of
all of our employees around the world
completed the training in 2019.

e Sustainability criteria were inclu-
ded in the rewarding schemes of the

Group.
To ensure the effective integration of

sustainability into our everyday acti-
vities, it is essential to incentivise our
employees. This raised interest and
engagement around the meaning of
sustainability and its applications
in achieving personal and Group
objectives. From 2019 all eligible
employees of the Chiesi Group will
benefit of a multiplier, based on the
achievement of the important com-
pany objectives, including sustaina-

bility principles.
