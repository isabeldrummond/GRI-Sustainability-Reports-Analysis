Introduction

As we can all observe, a cultural change is underway that will forever modify
the way we understand and do business. A change that Chiesi has embraced
and which sees the vocation of the company at the centre, as a guide for the

decisions we make and the actions we take every day.

For this reason 2019 was for us, in Chiesi, a year of redesign: the year in which

we created the conditions to imagine our future.

First of all, we have chosen to face a challenge that will accompany us in the
years to come: we want to become a Carbon Neutral company by 2035, zeroing
our emissions balance in advance on the deadlines set by the Paris Agreement

and, more recently, Europe, of 15 years.

The first step we have focused on is the knowledge of the problem in its
complexity, from the study of the emissions produced by our activity and the
solutions to reduce and mitigate them, to the operational implications. We have
undertaken a programme to measure the CO2 emissions associated with our
products, buildings, production sites and logistics. This step was fundamental
in the design of a multi-year Carbon Neutrality plan that will be put into action in
2020 and will guide the company over the next 15 years: an historic course for

Chiesi and the entire pharmaceutical sector.

Another crucial aspect for the current year is the strengthening of the stakeholder
engagement programme, with which we wish to share our experience and our
new way of doing business. We want to establish a true and solid relationship
of interdependence with our suppliers. We want to take care of and give new

life to the territory and local communities in which we operate around the world.

Furthermore, we want the people who work at Chiesi to have the tools and
conditions for their personal and professional fulfilment. The third great
challenge is diversity. We want to seek and apply best practices that foster
diversity and inclusion for an absolute goal of equity as a basis for contributing
to the happiness of all people in Chiesi.

Last but not least, we are laying the foundations for an evolution of our Research
and Development towards a new centrality of the patient. We intend to include
the patient, his or her experience and needs in the design of solutions from the
