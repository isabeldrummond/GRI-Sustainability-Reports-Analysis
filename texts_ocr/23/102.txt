Takeaways:

— Our business model is not specifically designed to reduce inequality within and
among countries. Chiesi’s commitment results in the alignment of our social and
environmental performance throughout our practices and processes to address
SDG 10 targets.

— Analysis of internal operations resulted in a good profile in all valuations topi-
cs (such as Management of Diversity; equity and Inclusion; workplace diversity
and inclusivity; social protection guarantee package) with additional improvement
steps available in the formalisation of procedures aimed at reducing inequalities.

— With regard to our supply chain, we have room to promote diversity within our
providers and, in particular, we could put in place specific activities to support
small scale suppliers to prevent discrimination and harassment.

— Our policy making strategy does not include any initiatives specifically designed
to advocate for policy changes to contribute to SDG 10 (either at individual or

collective level).

— Chiesi shows a low level of risk in negatively affecting or inhibiting SDG 10.
