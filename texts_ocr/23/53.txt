GHG emissions intensity"

(Tonne:

),./mln eq. units)

 

2019 2018
GHG emission intensity (Scope 1 + Scope 2 location based) 170 183
GHG emission intensity (Scope 1 + Scope 2 market based) 176 218

"The GHG emission intensity is calculated considering the GHG emissions (Scope 1 and
Scope 2) of the manufacturing plants divided by the production volume (reported as mil-
lion of Equivalent Units produced). The production sites considered are: Blois, Santana de
Parnaiba, Parma (Via Palermo-Via San Leonardo)

This and the above programs reinforce our commitment to the SDG 13

“Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”, which fosters the

integration of actions against the climate change into companies policies, strate-

gies and planning.

e Waste and water minimisation.
Waste and water can be a challenge
in our sector, as processes largely
depend on stringent quality require-
ments which are difficult to modify.
Our primary water consumption co-
mes from manufacturing processes
and related cleaning requirements.
We only use freshwater in all our
processes. These factors are also
directly correlated to the growth of
our business operations. Neverthe-
less, we established efficient control
systems regarding waste production
and disposal as well as water mana-
gement.

We are working to gradually imple-
ment waste reduction activities
both in manufacturing processes

(i.e. reduction of quantity of mate-

rials used in R&D tests, materials
used for dressing procedures) and
in offices (i.e. ban of plastic bottles
and introduction of drinking water
dispensers).

Many initiatives have been imple-
mented or are underway to actively
involve all of us in the reduction of
waste. The first step was to imple-
ment measurement and control of
water consumption and waste pro-
duction to all of our affiliates, so
to be able to set precise reduction
targets. Therefore in 2019 water
consumption and waste production
measurements were extended to the
vast majority of our affiliates, whe-
reas in 2018 they were limited to the

manufacturing sites.
