Improving patients health is the result of a
comprehensive plan of actions that the group is
implementing. The main initiatives that ran in 2019

are described below.

e We want to involve and engage
patients from the very beginning in

designing products and solutions. In
2019, thanks also to the inspiration
that our sustainability journey brou-
ght us, we reviewed our core proces-
ses, including R&D, in order to better
integrate patients’ perspectives into
our approach, with the objective of
including this view from the very
beginning of the research process.
Embedding the patients’ perspective
at every stage of drug development
represents a global commitment and
a differentiating point for Chiesi.

In line with this approach, in De-
cember 2019 we had the chance to
meet a Fabry Patient Advisory Board
composed of 14 Fabry disease pa-
tients coming from 11 EU countries.
We were able to learn from patients’
experiences and knowledge on dia-
gnosis, challenges and lifestyles of
Fabry sufferers. The results of this
project can also be beneficial for
other commercial and clinical pro-

cesses on a broader scale.

During the year, we also started a
collaborative dialogue with EUPATI
(European Academia of Patients) a
major patients association in the EU,
to learn about the organisation, its
objectives, the work done, the activi-
ties in place and to explore collabora-

tion opportunities.

e We want to contribute to impro-
ving healthcare access: We are
present in more than 100 countries

worldwide with our therapeutic solu-
tions and in 2019 we had 48 addi-
tional registrations of our products,
thus further enlarging geographical
access to our medicinal products. In
2019 we donated medicines to IHP
(International Health Partner), equi-
valent to an amount of over 700,000
Euros. In addition, we work together
with associations and we promote
programmes of early access to our
medicines, with a focus on exclusi-
ve Orphan Medicinal Products with
high unmet needs and no alternative
treatments available (read here our
dedicated policy).

Another important aspect is the ef-
fort carried on by the Chiesi Founda-
tion to improve the access to good
quality neonatal care particularly in
sub-saharian African countries as
well as the management of respira-

tory conditions in Latin America.

e@ We designed neonatal care pro-
grammes_ for healthcare _profes-
sionals worldwide. In harmony with
Chiesi’s commitment to foster scien-
tific advancement and medical edu-
cation in neonatology, during 2019
more than 20 affiliates, including EU,
US, China and emerging countries,
organised healthcare professional
training events. Over 450 educatio-
nal sessions were conducted, with
27,000 doctors involved, around cut-
ting-edge topics relevant for clinical
practice.
