Our Global Impact: the SDGs

As we embark on the Decade of Action, it is crucial that businesses adopt an

active role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The 17 SDGs were launched in 2015 by the United Nations in the 2030 Agen-
da, as a set of defined goals, targets, and indicators that the world community
must achieve in order to safeguard the planet and society. Reaching these go-
als will require the involvement of stakeholders worldwide: governments, insti-
tutions, businesses, organisations, and individuals. We are all impacted by the
challenges of our time, and the Sustainable Development Goals are the global

framework to achieve true sustainability.

While we recognise that the 17 SDGs are all equally important, we have deter-

mined that our contribution can be higher for 9 of them, that we have therefore

 

embedded in our strategic plan.

However, measuring a company’s contribution to the SDGs has proven difficult
so far. This is why we decided to use a new tool to measure our impact: the SDG

Action Manager. Description of the results is provided later in this report.
