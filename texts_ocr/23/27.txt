rience is improved by preventing the
repeated, uncomfortable positioning
of these devices. Cardiovascular is a
particularly important therapy area
in the USA, and the expansion of our
portfolio helps us to deliver products
that enhance patient care, and meet
the needs of providers in this setting.
Immunosuppression after kidney or
liver transplantation is a clear me-
dical need, and we have advanced
to patients a novel dosage form of
a widely used immunosuppressant
with an enhanced pharmacokinetic
profile which translates into better
safety and patients acceptance of

the treatment.

Rare diseases

There are a wide variety of rare di-
seases, typically very severe and
affecting very few patients. Rare di-
seases are characterised by a broad
diversity of disorders and symptoms
that vary not only from disease to
disease but also from patient to pa-
tient. Relatively common symptoms
can hide underlying rare diseases le-
ading to misdiagnosis and delaying
treatment. Indeed, many rare dise-
ases have been largely neglected
with no effective treatments sought
or discovered. They are often chro-
nic, progressive, degenerative, and
frequently life-threatening.

Anew Business Unit focused on rare
diseases has been created in Chie-
si with a patient-driven perspective.
The Global Rare Diseases Unit will
adopt a “disease-modifying” or “di-
sease-resolving” mentality and ser-
ve the patients and their families
with an approach at 360 degrees
that changes the patients’ lives. It is

based in Boston, a key area of biote-

chnological innovation. In the first 3
months, it already counts more than
150 employees and is present in the
US, Canada, Europe and a few emer-
ging countries including Turkey and
Australia. One particular field of our
work is lysosomal storage diseases,
which is a family of rare and ultra-ra-
re disorders that are a consequence
of the lack of a specific lysosomal
enzyme and which are often asso-
ciated with progressive declines in
mental and motor functioning as
well as dysfunction of other organ
systems.

Alpha Mannosidosis, an ultra-rare
genetic disease presenting a wide
range of symptoms: the most fre-
quent are recurrent chest infections
and problems with hearing loss, di-
stinctive facial features, cognitive
impairment and progressive mu-
scular weakness. Velmanase alfa is
the active ingredient in our product
representing the first enzyme repla-
cement therapy for the treatment of
alpha-mannosidosis. The long-term
prognosis of this disease is general-
ly poor, with reduced life expectan-
cy. As an important “partner” to this
novel therapeutic, we constantly
work to improve diagnosis for these
diseases to facilitate the identifica-
tion and access of patients to op-
timal care. A pilot study to improve
diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis is
currently run by Centogene (a spe-
cialized diagnostic company) with
Chiesi’s support in Germany, Austria
and Switzerland. Participating tre-
ating physicians receive a special
kit that allows blood samples of
patients presenting with symptoms
potentially suggestive of alpha-man-

nosidosis and send it to the central
