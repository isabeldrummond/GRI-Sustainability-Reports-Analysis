Care Unit in Pakistan has also been
carried out by our affiliate there, con-
scious that this country has the hi-
ghest neonatal mortality rate in the
world and deserves an urgent joint
government and industry effort. We

want this to be just the start.

@ We set up patient support services
in the US as a pilot for international
development. In the US, Chiesi wor-

ks with Eversana to provide services

and support directly to patients. With
a dedicated team including pharmacy
staff, we contributed to helping pe-
ople comply with therapies through
reminders for treatment adherence
and periodic health assessments.
The service also included assistance
through the insurance reimbursement
process. The goal of this programme
is to ensure that each patient receives
a customised plan based on their uni-

que needs.
