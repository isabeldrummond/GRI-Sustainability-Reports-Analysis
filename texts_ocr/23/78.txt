as the Hospital of Parma, the local
Service Centre for Volunteering and
the Pubblica Assistenza, to answer
to the needs of the most vulnerable
categories of our community. With
this project, we ensure assistance to
people in difficulty, especially the el-
derly, who may be not fully self-suf-
ficient when discharged from the
hospital, especially in case of lack of
family support. The project, started in
2019 in its pilot phase, will continue
at full speed in 2020. It can be con-
sidered a best practice since it leve-
rages the collaboration between the

public, private and third sector, inclu-

ding the volunteering world.

e We maintain our active collabora-
tion with the Teatro Regio. In colla-
boration with local stakeholders, we
actively contribute to enhance the cul-
tural soul of the city. Built in the first
half of the 1800s, the Teatro Regio is
a national and international treasure.
We work closely with the Teatro Re-
gio Foundation to spread the culture
of art and performance, and to foster
professional development in artistic,
technical and musical education.
This way we cherish and cultivate the
priceless heritage linked to Opera,
dance and music of our homeland,
making Parma more attractive and a

better place to live.
