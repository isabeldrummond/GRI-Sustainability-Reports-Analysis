Each year approximately 2% of ba-
bies are born suffering from hypoxic
respiratory distress often associated
with pulmonary hypertension. For 25
years these critically ill babies have
been treated for hours or days with
inhaled nitric oxide, a potent vasodi-
lator, which relaxes smooth muscle
in the lungs and assists the transport
of oxygen to the blood stream. As
well as being connected to a venti-
lator, these neonates are connected
to a large and complicated device
which supplies the nitric oxide from
heavy gas cylinders. Chiesi has licen-
sed the rights to a novel device whi-
ch creates nitric oxide at the bedside
from ambient air using a small, easy
to use technology. This system is
currently in the development phase
and Chiesi has the distribution rights
in all major territories worldwide.
Our innovation efforts are not limi-
ted to those in respiratory disease,
but also to other devastating con-
sequences of premature birth, such
as neonatal brain injury. A further
example is a severe condition, with
high social and clinical impact, espe-
cially in U.S., called neonatal opioid
withdrawal syndrome, in which ba-
bies exposed to opioids in the ute-
rus (because of the use or abuse of
these drugs by the mother) are born
with a level of dependence and a bro-
ad range of complications. For this
condition we are developing a novel
formulation and delivery system for
administration of buprenorphine by
the neonatal nurse to alleviate the
babies’ suffering.

Chiesi’s commitment to neonatology
does not end with the research and
development of innovative therapies

and devices. We also support trai-

ning projects to improve the clini-
cal practices of neonatologists. For
example, in Poland, our Multichannel
Neonatology Project aims at suppor-
ting traditional channels for promo-
tion in neonatology and to maintain
Chiesi’s scientific leadership in this
field. In Spain, after the success of
the first edition in 2017, a second
edition of our innovation project
(Neostart) was held, involving all
the key stakeholders in the field of
neonatology, with the objective of
co-creating breakthrough solutions
to improve the quality of life of pre-
mature babies and their families. A
similar initiative has also been imple-
mented in Russia, and collaboration
is ongoing with neonatologists in
Pakistan to address the need to im-
prove access and quality of care in
this country, where neonatal death is

particularly high.

Special care

The treatment of serious cardiova-
scular disorders and complications
is another area of high need. Our
commitment in this area is signi-
ficant. The portfolio consists of a
thrombolytic agent to break up clots
obstructing the coronary arteries, a
platelet antiaggregant to prevent the
formation of clots when catheters
are used to break coronary plaques, a
calcium channel blocker indicated
for the reduction of blood pressure,
and a synthetic direct thrombin inhi-
bitor. The thrombolytic agent is also
being developed for the rapid and
effective clearance of blood clots in
indwelling catheters used for drug
administration in a range of indica-
tions, including in cancer patients.
