RISK LEVEL

Takeaways:

— Our business model is not specifically designed to make cities and human settle-
ments inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Chiesi’s commitment results in the
alignment of our social and environmental performance throughout our practices

and processes to address SDG 11 targets.

—Chiesi improved access to high quality jobs and green spaces for the surrounding
communities: our” Green Km” initiative is just one example. Moreover, we strengthe-
ned and safeguarded the cultural and natural heritage assets in the city of Parma
with specific initiatives, such as ‘Parma, lo Ci Sto!’ and supporting Parma’s candidacy
as EU Green Capital. We also put in place specific practices to reduce carbon emis-
sions from transportation, hence reducing the carbon footprint caused by travel /
commuting. Although we are heading the right direction, there are still some areas
that can be improved. One possible action to this effect would be encouraging the
use of sustainable transport with Chiesi employees and fostering the implementa-

tion of programs regarding waste management and indoor air quality checks.
— Chiesi’s supply chain contribution on SDG 11 has achieved a satisfactory result,
but we know it's only a starting point and we are continuing to work to reduce carbon

emissions related to transportation, in line with the objective of carbon neutrality.

— We have specific activities to advocate for policy changes in our local community

to contribute to SDG 11 (either at individual or collective level).

— Chiesi shows a low level of risk in negatively affecting or inhibiting SDG 11.
