Having a positive impact on the territory is the
result of a comprehensive plan of actions that the
Group is implementing. The main initiatives that
ran in 2019 are described below.

e With an organic vision, we stra-
tegically guide all the projects that
Chiesi_ promotes in the Parma terri-
tory, our hometown, through a dedi-
cated Committee - the Committee
for Social and Community Develop-
ment Activities. We know our prospe-
rity is linked to that of our community
and we care about the development
of our local territory. We focus on
Parma, where we are based, while
creating a model of company-com-
munity interaction that can be used
as a reference by all of our internatio-
nal affiliates.

We focus on three specific areas of
intervention: Education, on both he-
alth and environmental topics; Deve-
lopment, intended as social, cultural,
economic and environmental pro-
sperity of the community; Emergen-
cies, support for environmental disa-
sters such as floods or earthquakes
or other critical situations such as
the global health emergency caused
by the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
This approach is extended to Chiesi
Affiliates worldwide, with tools and
guidelines to set up the same pro-
grammatic strategy, while preser-
ving the peculiarities of local com-

munities.

e We are among the founders of
Pauma, ic ci slo! Born in 2016, this
association aims to catalyse concrete
actions for the sustainable develop-
ment of the territory of Parma. The

association creates networks among

companies, citizens, public institu-
tions, schools and other actors of
the city, also bringing new ideas and
projects aimed to create value in our
community. Sectors of interest of Par-
ma, lo Ci Sto! are food, culture, educa-
tion and innovation, tourism and leisu-

re, and environmental sustainability.

e@ We support Parma as Italian Ca-
pital of Culture. In 2020 the city of
Parma, where our Headquarters is
located, was awarded the honour of
being the Italian Capital of Culture
thanks to its cultural heritage and
the peculiar and unique partnership
between the public and private sec-
tor that characterises our territory.
Indeed, many actors, including com-
panies, worked together to achieve
this important objective. This pro-
gram is an opportunity for the city to
promote its economic, cultural and
social growth and to increase the at-
tractiveness to its citizens, workers
and tourists. As a founder and mem-
ber of the association “Parma, io ci
sto!”, Chiesi played a key role in the
nomination of Parma with ideas and
economic sponsorship, both in 2019
and in 2020. In addition, we also
promoted specific projects, such as
“Pharmacopea”, which aims to re-
discover the chemical and pharma-
ceutical identity of the city of Parma
and to enhance the value of historic
locations linked to this identity, such
as old pharmacies and the botanical

gardens.
