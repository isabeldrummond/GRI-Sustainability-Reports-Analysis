Highlights

There is an open conversation in the world of work on the need to broaden
companiesâ€™ attitudes towards workplace wellness, taking a holistic appro-
ach that considers all aspects of the individual's health, including self- ful-
fillment at the workplace. The growth of a company cannot leave aside
the self-fulfilment and wellbeing of its people. It is becoming increasingly
clear that people's wellbeing makes business sense.
Over the years, we have come to understand that working for people's wel-
Ibeing helps in attracting and retaining younger talents as well as encoura-
ging older employees to improve and progress. It produces happier, heal-
thier individuals who will be more engaged, generating greater productivity.
In 2019 we made Chiesi a B Corp. This achievement infused positive ener-
gy among our people, who have endorsed the B Corp values. Today we all
share a double purpose culture of work, focused on both profit and societal
benefit. This common ground represents a significant evolution for us as
a group, and a lever for growth, which is both economic and sustainable.

Globally, we are a team of 5,480 internal employees
(around +5% vs 2018) and 466 external collaborators.
