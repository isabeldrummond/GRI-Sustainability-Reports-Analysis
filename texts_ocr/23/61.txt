We have 11 certified mentors in Edi-
tion 1 in our HQ and are rolling out to

our Affiliates.

e We enhanced our health and wel-
Ibeing program.

It is essential to provide our employe-
es with the tools and knowledge re-
quired to enhance their quality of life.
The first fundamental step was to
pursue the LEED Gold certification
for our new Headquarters for 2020.
LEED is the most recognised and ad-
vanced certification developed for
better buildings, not only in terms
of energy performance, but also for
the impact on the wellbeing of the
occupants providing, among others,
cutting edge solutions to improve fre-
sh air, reduce volatile organic com-
pounds, and to optimise temperature
and lighting regulation.

In Italy, we also involved our employe-
es in a number of programmes en-
compassing nutrition, better work-life
balance, stress reduction, counselling
for new mothers, time saving servi-
ces, yoga, life coaching, anti-smoking
campaigns, and safety at work.

We implemented a health program-
me, aimed at preventing diseases

such as chronic obstructive bronchi-

tis, cardiovascular diseases and neo-
plasms.

We have nourished and strengthe-
ned our company culture, engaging
people around the B Corp values and
sharing the social and environmen-
tal standards and practices, through
which we operate, with specific cour-

ses and events.

e We engage with universities to at-
tract young talents.

The success of our company de-
pends on the collective decisions
made every day by our people. This
is why it is fundamental that we are
able to attract the most talented and
motivated persons, while creating
the conditions and company culture
which allow them to thrive. This is a
distinctive trait that we want to pre-
serve over time. We set up a series
of collaborations with the universi-
ties of Parma and Milan to engage
students in our business case, the
meaning and implications of being
a pharmaceutical company and the
details of the therapeutic areas that
we focus on. This is done with the
concepts of Shared Value and Bene-
fit Corporation in mind. In this way
we are able to raise awareness and
interest among the most famous uni-
versities and, at the same time, gain

“fresh and direct” feedback about us.
