SDG Action Manager

The result is a new, publicly available online tool, the SDG Action Manager (SDG
AM): an actionable management platform for businesses to assess, compare
and improve their performance in order to deliver tangible progress on the Su-
stainable Development Goals by 2030.

Companies are now supported in managing their impact on the SDGs throu-
ghout their operations, supply chain, business model, and collective action, whi-
le monitoring their risk of negative impact.

The tool incorporates the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact and the Su-
stainable Development Goals (SDGs) and was built through a rigorous process
of information and feedback of a range of stakeholders, including experts in
corporate sustainability, civil society, UN, and academia.

Before being officially launched, the SDG AM tool went through a beta testing
phase, during which more than 60 businesses from around the world, networ-
ks or organisations with expertise in one or more of the SDGs contributed as
advisors.

Chiesi, due to their experience in the field, was invited to contribute to the deve-
lopment of SDG number 3 - Good Health and Well-Being - by testing the metric
sets as they were rolled out, prototyping the online platform through develop-

ment, and piloting features as they were completed.

Chiesi’s Results

We decided to be one of the first companies in the world to adopt the new tool
and this section reports the results of our very first analysis. These scores resul-
ted from a self assessment approach based on internal company information
and interpretation of the SDG Action Manager content. The performance is not
validated by B Lab, but the use of an internationally shared tool still allows us
to spread our best practices worldwide, responding to a core value of the 2030

Agenda, as well as comparing our performance against other companies.

The analysis has produced 3 results:

1. The Baseline

The Baseline module is a starting point that includes cross-cutting issues that
apply to all SDGs prior to diving deep into individual SDGs. The baseline consists
of a series of questions about how companies can proactively manage specific
issues related to the 10 principles of the UNGC. It then returns an overview of
the company’s commitment to social and environmental issues, such as com-
mitments to human rights, positive labour practices, environmental manage-

ment systems, and good governance.
