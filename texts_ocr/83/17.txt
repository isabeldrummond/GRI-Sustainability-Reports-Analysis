MATERIALITY
ASSESSMENT

At ltalpreziosi we are aware of the centrality of all 17
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and that is why we
consider the need to treat them holistically and not
individually. Each objective influences the other, and it is
therefore necessary, within the limits set by our range of
action, to include the 17 objectives in all our activities.

The Materiality Assessment process is central to the drafting
of the Sustainability Report. The methodological process
integrated the following phases:

IDENTIFICATION: significant issues are identified by

8 performing an analysis of the business context and
our Business Plan;

8 PRIORITISATION: the issues that more than others will
have a fundamental impact both inside and outside
the company activities have been identified. In doing
this, the involvement of our stakeholders and the
inclusion of their visions in ours is fundamental;

8 VALIDATION: all themes and aspects identified and
prioritised in compliance with the principle of
"completeness'.

All these values, in addition to having been fundamental in
the preparation of the Report, were crucial issues for the
development of the 2020-2025 Business Plan.
