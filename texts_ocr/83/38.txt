The solid managerial structure has been
designed to meet the highest standards of
compliance with national and _ international
laws and regulations, as well as the standards
that we voluntarily follow. The goal is to
actively work towards the creation of a more
sustainable , responsible and fair supply chain
towards each individual actor who is part of it.
Fair working conditions, prohibition of child
labour, gender equality and respect for human
rights are fundamental foundations of our due
diligence processes, expressed in our policies.
Our policies therefore represent a fundamental
document for every business relationship, and
we ask each counterparty to sign them, so
that they morally commit to carrying out our
own values for respect for the environment,
human rights and communities.

Each stakeholder must therefore actively work in line with our policies. Our staff are
constantly updated on internal compliance procedures, which are progressive and aim to
continuously improve in line with industry standards. The collaboration between the various
departments is constantly valued as a fundamental tool to guarantee continuous
monitoring for each potential and already active counterpart. Our awareness of each of
our counterparts is also constant in adhering to and applying the same standards that we
have followed, to contribute to creating greater awareness of the possibilities we have to

concretely improve our supply chain.
