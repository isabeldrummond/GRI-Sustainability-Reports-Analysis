CONSTANT
ENHANCEMENT OF
OUR PEOPLE

vs
SF

For us, bringing economic value together with human
value in all our activities has always been a
fundamental factor. In fact, our company exists only
thanks to the work, determination and collaboration
of our staff.

Our people are therefore our strength and represent
a crucial asset in our activities. This is why we always
try to grow with them, and pursue in our path
sustainability.

We periodically conduct a Climate Work Survey, to
monitor the well-being, performance and needs of
our team.
