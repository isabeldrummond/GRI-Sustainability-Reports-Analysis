OUR COMMITMENT

For over 37 years our mission has been to be a point of reference for our stakeholders within the
precious metal supply chain, offering excellence, quality, security, innovation and reliability.

For our stakeholders we mean: employees, local communities, customers, suppliers, institutions,
members, organisations, companies, associations and competitors. We want to continue creating
value with products and services of the highest quality and reliability, with the aim of contributing
to a better precious metal industry, for everyone. In fact, it is important for us to enhance every
part of the supply chain, from the miner, to the supplier, to our people, to the end customer, and
not only: for us also the environment, biodiversity, water and climate represent key players and
must be preserved and enhanced not only for us, but above all for future generations.

For this reason, we work day by day to continue to be a reference company in the trade,
recovery and refining of precious metals, strengthening our position and _ international
competitiveness through integration, cooperation and acquisition processes. Synergy with our
stakeholders is and will be fundamental to advance in our sustainable agenda.

Our standards and policies are in line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda, on the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), which have always characterised our business, and today more than
ever. We dialogue and collaborate with our counterparts to share and enhance the standards
that we voluntarily follow and that we are convinced can change the trend of the industry
making it even more responsible. This will only be possible through sincere collaboration and
transparent information, which will allow the increase of best practices.

Our Sustainability Report is based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and is in line with the
United Nations Global Compact and the SDGs. The aim is to show the progress we have made to
date and outline our objectives for the coming years, with a view to constant improvement.
