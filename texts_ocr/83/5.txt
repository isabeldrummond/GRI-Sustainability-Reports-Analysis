ear collaborators and partners,

Jor the first time lalpreziosi presents its sustainability report, a document that wants to summarise our values and
our vision of the world and that illustrates what we have done and what we will do to pursue sustainable
development in order to guarantee harmonious growth of our business not only in economic terms, but also socially
and environmentally creating relationships based on transparency, trust and paying particular attention to the
involvement of is stakeholders, shareholders, employees, collaborators, customers, suppliers, governments,

authorities and local communities.

Lhave always made of the sustainable journey and humanistic capitalism, the guide of my career as an entrepreneur.

With our sustainable path we want to promote a fairer and more harmonious future, respectful of the environment,

of the planet's resources, of human dignity by enhancing education, training and awareness. I believe that
sustainability ts a social pact with future generations as with this path, in our small way, we want to meet the needs
of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Sustainability, in our sector in particular, ts a complex path and it takes a lot of determination and courage to find
new solutions.

Talking about ethical gold ts a very dear topic for me and I would like to remind you that through GoldLake IP,

already in 2007, we were among the first in the world to address these issues and above all to put them into practice
with total traceability of gold from extraction to the finished jewel, having concluded an exclusive contract with
Carter.

Ethics ts that branch of philosophy that studies the conduct of human beings and the criteria on the basis of which
behaviour and choices are evaluated. Ethics represents away of acing, a concrete doing in everyday life, ethics ts a

word often used inappropriately because it ts much easter to pronounce it than to put it into practice.
