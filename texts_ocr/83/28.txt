LOOKING AT THE
PRESENT

Our systems are of the latest generation and high
technology, in order to maximise efficiency and
minimise environmental impact, with emissions
close to zero.

Minimising the environmental impact is a crucial
goal for our company: considering that greenhouse
gas emissions are one of the main causes of global
warming and climate change, we have decided to
avoid using one of the main causes of emissions, or
fossil fuels. This is the reason why we have chosen
not to use coal and diesel in our refinery, but "cold"
chemical processes, to considerably reduce
emissions.

We also installed photovoltaic solar technologies in
the upper part of our building and this was the first
step towards the use of increasingly clean energy
resources.
