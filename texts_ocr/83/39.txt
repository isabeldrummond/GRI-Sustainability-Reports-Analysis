We are committed to promoting sustainable and ethical businesses that allow the creation of
a more inclusive market for everyone and respecting the environment in which they operate.
This is why we are active in associations and organisations to improve sustainability in the
precious metal industry and to reduce environmental, social and health impacts.

For us, a sustainable approach means that we care about who, where and how this material is
produced. Because every single actor is important in the supply chain.
