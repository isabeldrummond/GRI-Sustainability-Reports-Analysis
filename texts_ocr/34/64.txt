The second-level union agreements testify to the desire to modernize certain contractual
institutions and to develop new ones, designed on the basis of the needs of the employees, to
create a climate of mutual trust between the Company and its collaborators.

Especially in consideration of the Company's location on Via Tiburtina, Elettronica has provided
conditions of effective life-work balance also through “flexi-time” and by introducing specific
initiatives in favour of employees as if they were members of a family unit. We understand the
difficulty of being parents in the context of a big city and the need to be present at important
moments of private life.

Facilitating the lives of the employees also means facilitating the handling of paperwork, and for
this we have made available a manned internal banking service open every day from 12:00 to
14:00.

To support pregnant employees in a delicate phase of life and work, we have decided to go
beyond the specific provisions of the law on the protection of pregnant women and mothers.
Colleagues, already from the first phase of communication to the Company of their state of
pregnancy, are supported in all formal, administrative and bureaucratic aspects and receive
nursing and medical support, if necessary. In 2019, 5 pregnant workers were assisted: they
received information on the prevention and protection measures to be adopted at this particular
moment and on specific risks. In addition, parking spaces have been reserved inside by the
Company to allow them to reach the workplace more easily. Special attention is also paid to the
disabled, both the recently hired and those who have progressed during their working life. The
Company, going beyond mere compliance with the obligations established by law, is well aware
that the inclusion of everyone results in the creation of a better work environment: for this reason,
it tries to use sensitivity in dealing, case by case, with the specific situations. The most relevant
diversity in our Company is linked to the physical or mental disabilities of individuals and often,
finding ourselves facing different problems, we talk to managers and find solutions, always
protecting the interests of the person as much as possible. Elettronica believes it is important to
adopt initiatives that foster the well-being and respect of people of different cultures who visit
the Company or who are temporary members (customers, suppliers, foreign delegations,
training groups, etc.). For this purpose, it has created special spaces for its guests for prayer
and refreshment points that take into account the different cultural and religious customs and it
has instructed the Company refectory to prepare meals, scrupulously following the dictates of
the respective cultures and religions.
