Management

 

The production and the promotion of innovation are the driving elements of our
corporate business, as well as representing an aware approach to the creation of
economic and social value for the Company, for the Territory and for all its
Stakeholders. The propensity for innovation requires the ability to intercept,
systematise and create synergies between the different actors of the innovative
process. For this reason, we actively participate

in think tanks on technological development issues, we enhance the Company's
people and its intellectual capital, and we launch and foster opportunities for
collaboration with universities and research centres.

5.1
INNOVATION PRODUCTION

Innovation is a top priority for us. Despite the current context in which the margins
of the sector are decreasing, the Company continues to innovate, increasing the
investments destined for research and development activities.

 

The ability to seize the opportunities that exist in the national and international context, favouring
and transforming them into technological solutions, represents Elettronica's great contribution
to the innovation process and to the creation of value that ensues for the Country System and
for all Stakeholders. In 2019 we invested more than Euro 11 million in innovation projects, in
continuity with the incremental trend defined by the Companyâ€™s choices of recent years, and
with the investment forecasts of 13 million contained in the three-year plan (PBMT). At the same
time, we intend to take avail of external funding opportunities by participating in regional, national
and international calls for tender. Elettronica's participation in community-funded programmes
is particularly important, in a context in which Europe, through tenders in the Defence and
Security sector, promotes research and innovation, and optimises the development and
acquisition of technologies by the Member States. In this sense, our commitment is aimed at
achieving results, not only for ourselves but also for the country, and it confirms our role as
important players in European industrial policy, also thanks to the activities of our representative
office in Brussels.
