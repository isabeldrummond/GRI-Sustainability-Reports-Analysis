With commitment and tenacity, we have achieved skills of excellent level,
offering solutions in the avionics, naval and ground forces, and in cyber and
homeland security sectors. Our systems equip the platforms of many Italian
and foreign armed forces of air, land and sea. All this is possible thanks to
the Company's ability to perfect specific techniques and strategies in the
creation of its systems, always aiming for excellence.

We study, develop and produce defence systems using proprietary technologies. We offer solutions
for the operational needs of our customers, offering systems with technical performance of a level
to meet increasingly challenging requirements. We dedicate care and attention to the technological
evolution of our products and we develop new ones. We integrate them, both with each other and
with other sensors or with contrast and data fusion tools, and we provide for their installation on the
customer's platforms covering every domain.

Electronic defence in radar band is our historical core business, a field in which we are proud of our
extensive, worldwide-recognized experience. In this context, we design, develop and produce:

° ESM - Electronic Support Measures: devices which intercept, identify and locate radar
emitters, accurately measuring their parameters.

° ELINT - Electronic Intelligence devices: which carry out in-depth analyses on the emitters of
interest, detecting every detail.

° RWR - Radar Warning Receivers: tools designed to promptly discover and identify
broadcasters which represent a potential threat.

¢ ECM- Electronic Countermeasures: systems able to contrast the radar emitters present in
the electromagnetic spectrum.

In addition to the radar systems, we also have consolidated experience in the infra-red field - through
the development of an advanced IR Jammer - and in the defence of electronics in band
communications - embedding COMINT (COMmunications INTelligence) systems into more complex
systems, in close collaboration with the major Electronic Defence companies. Elettronica Roma and
Elettronica GmBH also offer cyber solutions, developed by CY4GATE.

Operating in a highly regulated sector, we offer products and services that comply with government
regulations, carefully selecting our customers and reference markets.
