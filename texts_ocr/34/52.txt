appointed a company specialized in the Travel Security sector, to constantly monitor any risks

The Safety Award
Safety at Elettronica is above all a Company mentality and an approach to work, not just

compliance with procedures. The Safety Award is a consequence of this attitude, the award was
created precisely to increase sensitivity and awareness relative to the issue of safety and health
at work, by the analysis and consideration of specific problems and the proposal of “original”
solutions.

The participants - potentially all employees - form cross-departmental groups in order to have
the widest possible vision on the same issue and to combine and compare sensitivity and
different approaches. The award day is structured as a workshop also open to other companies
and experts of the sector interested in the chosen issue.

The 2018/2019 edition of the Security Award focused on the organisation of security in the
Company and, in particular, on methods and tools for active participation in the management of
electronic security. The 14 participants were able to try their hand at developing solutions on the
subject of knowledge management, visual management and on an issue of their choice for which
the group in charge chose QR Code safety management.
