The procurement process
Consequent to a purchasing strategy and/or whenever a purchasing need arises, we

implement the procurement process through our dedicated departments; the process is
divided into two operational phases: Vendor Selection and Procurement. The procurement
management process, like the Companyâ€™s other processes, has been the subject of digital
transformation with the adoption of the Document Archive tool, allowing a reduction of
environmental impact as well as more efficient documentation management.

Vendor Selection Procurement

2. Analysis of the offers and purchase orders

DEVELOPMENT AND
ENHANCEMENT OF THE
SUPPLY-CHAIN

 

Innovation, quality and reliability of the solutions and OF our products are
deeply linked to our ability to select, stimulate and focus on an excellent and
sustainable supply chain.

Weare convinced that the ability to develop new products and solutions, to use the technologies
available at the state of the art and to maintain the competitiveness required to operate on the
global market, and to be able to make partner suppliers reliable and aware of their role. For this
reason, we have adopted an approach aimed at making suppliers aware of their strengths and
weaknesses, to work together with us to achieve adequate levels of reliability and, at the same
time, excellence. This approach already in the accreditation phase and continues throughout
the relationship with our suppliers, managed through the Supply Relationship Management
(SRM) process.
