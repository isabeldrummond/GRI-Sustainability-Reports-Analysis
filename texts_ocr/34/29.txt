Social responsibility and
sustainability

2.1

Being socially responsible means taking into account the social and
environmental effects generated by our decisions and actions.

We are oriented towards social responsibility, with the firm intention of
adopting a management method that creates value for the shareholders
and for all the subjects with which the Company interacts, developing
relationships based on trust and transparency, to give our contribution to
sustainable development.

 

We are aware of being part of a wider ecosystem, made up of different actors, each of which brings
energy and skills for common growth; we are aware of our business role, of the effects we generate
and of our contribution to sustainable development, with a clear vision and adopting the consequent
strategies and actions.

In consideration of this awareness and in line with the corporate mission, we have provided
ourselves with a series of governance, management and reporting tools - from the Code of Ethics,
to Corporate Risk Management, and the Social Report - which allow us to guide, plan, monitor and
report our social responsibility.

Through a process of joint participation with the involvement of the top management, we have
defined the field of action of our Social Responsibility and identified the goals of the United Nations
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on which we intend to focus our activities.

The definition of the scope of action was guided by the indications provided by UNI-ISO 26000 -
Guide to Corporate Social Responsibility: we asked ourselves about the relevant aspects, we
reflected on the aspects of each within the Company, and we formulated visions and commitments
for each.
