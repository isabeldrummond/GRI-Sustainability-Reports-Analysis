Key Position assessment
In 2019 we introduced a system to assess critical positions - Key Positions - which, through the

adoption of a recognized and shared model within the organization, allows for periodically identifying
the current Key Positions of the Company, to take into consideration potential risks and critical
issues deriving from incorrect coverage of the positions examined and to develop professional paths
within the Company and, more in general, strategic planning of resources, to ensure alignment
between positions and persons in charge.

105 critical positions were mapped by this system, considering the people holding the defined Key
Positions, assessing their level of alignment in terms of performance trends and “spendability” (i.e.
the possibility of holding other positions).

Lean Life Style

The Lean Lifestyle project, launched in 2018, dedicated to the Engineering population, was created
with the aim of promoting the pursuit of corporate results, of enabling employees to share scenarios
and to become aware of their contribution and, at the same time, of seeking an optimal balance
between personal and private life and of developing an effective individual/company relationship
model.

The project made it possible to increase the level of information sharing and employee involvement,
as can also be seen from the surveys carried out during the “Great Place to Work” certification
phase.

In 2018, the number of employees who declared that “Managers keep me informed of important
issues and changes” increased by 13% (compared to 2027), and in 2019 it has reached 63%. Those
who said that they were involved in decisions that affect their work or the working environment had
increased by 18%, and in 2019 by another 2%.

 

The enhancement of skills also involves initiatives aimed at transferring know-how
and experience within the Company. The EWpedia and the Management
Academy projects go in this direction.

EWpedia
In 2015, in support of an initiative conceived spontaneously by certain employees, the project of a

digital “encyclopaedia” on electronic defence was launched, with the aim of creating virtuous
communities of practice in the sector and facilitating the transfer of know-how and of experience
within the Company. EWpedia was created to share and to make available knowledge which is often
“tacit”, the result of the experience gained over time by the most brilliant engineers and technicians
in Elettronica. Freely inspired by the Wikipedia format, today EWpedia represents, in the technical
field, a valuable on-line database of useful information and advice for daily work.

Management Academy
In 2018 we launched a Management Academy programme, as a tool to encourage Company training

and learning by doing, rendering systematic and spreading specific knowledge of the business. The
project involved training courses based on forms of coaching, in which senior colleagues accompany
junior colleagues on a structured path of professional growth, making available and transferring skills
and experience. In 2019, 8 seniors were involved to train 195 juniors.

A distinctive section of the Academy is the Electronic Warfare skills centre, in which engineering
know-how transfer courses have been organized and the Train The Trainer path was launched,
training 23 employees to become trainers in turn.
