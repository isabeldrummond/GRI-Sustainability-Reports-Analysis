SRM dualifcation Reliability Rating and
" Analysis follow-up

 

 

The process comprises the selection and accreditation/qualification of the suppliers, the
reliability analysis with consequent definition and management of de-risk actions, the
measurement and monitoring of their performances, identifying areas for improvement and
implementing corrective or improvement action.

In particular, as part of the “Reliability Analysis” activity, all activities aimed at intercepting,
identifying and dealing with risks that may affect the correct implementation of Elettronica’s
programmes are included, mitigating or remedying critical issues reported and preventing the
possibility of delays or extra costs of supplies.

The supplier reliability analysis is based on an analytical and quantitative risk assessment grid
which attributes to each supplier a reliability score. Before the order is issued and then during the
supply relationship, the score is reviewed and assessed by inspections carried out at the
supplier’s premises.

The "Vendor rating and follow up" activity aims to assess all aspects of our suppliers. The Quality
Committee collects feedback from the corporate structures that use a service or tangible assets,
thus identifying the gaps that must be bridged. In this way Elettronica gives an active contribution
to the supplier’s improvement, by monitoring the corrective action agreed on together with the
supplier.
