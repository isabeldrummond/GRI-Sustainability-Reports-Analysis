OUR MATERIAL ISSUES

The materiality matrix allows us to identify the issues of
greatest interest to the Company and its stakeholders,
increasing the ability to create shared value.

In 2019 we adopted the principle of materiality in the social reporting process, a principle
that allows us to identify the most relevant issues, as those that are capable of reflecting the
economic, environmental and social impact of the organization and of influencing the decisions
of the stakeholders. The materiality analysis has allowed us to broaden the field of analysis to
issues although not previously explored, to assign a priority both to those that are already
known and have already been reported, and to those newly identification, allowing us take
a step forward in awareness and knowledge of the effects that the Company generates on
the economy, society and the environment. The meeting points between the priorities of the
stakeholders and those of the Company, with regard to the important Social Responsibility
issues, has given rise to our materiality matrix.
