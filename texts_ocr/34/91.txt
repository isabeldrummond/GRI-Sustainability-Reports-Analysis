USE OF RESOURCES AND WASTE
MANAGEMENT

 

In order to contribute to reducing waste and to the sustainability of natural resources,
we have taken direct measures to ensure careful management of water and paper
resources as well as to minimize and manage waste production.

Sustainable consumption
As of 2015, the progressive rationalization of the cooling circuits of environmental chambers

and vibrators has made it possible to reduce the consumption of water taken from the wells as
well as that taken from the municipal aqueduct.

To reduce the impact for printing needs, as of 2020 Elettronica will purchase only FSC (Forest
Stewardship Council) Certified paper.

Waste

In 2012 we introduced the separate collection of waste similar to urban waste, with the aim of
minimizing the amount of unsorted waste produced.

Around 150 collection points for paper and for multi-materials (plastics and metals) have been
positioned throughout the Company (offices and open spaces), thus minimizing the production
of unsorted waste. Non-hazardous urban type waste gathered in this way is taken daily to the
ecological waste deposit built in 2016, for the intermediate collection of waste which is then
disposed of by the municipal authority in charge of waste disposal. Special waste, on the other
hand, is produced:

¢ within the sphere of the production processes, generated as is the result of the same

* consequent to technical obsolescence

* consequent to an expiry date that cannot be extended

* as a result of the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of the Company’s technical
systems, such as lighting, air conditioning, heating, air treatment, etc. ...

* as aresult of the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of the machines on the production
line
