problems that arise in the innovation design phase, which aims to develop solutions that
transcend the specific problem in itself to suggest practices that can lead to user-centred
innovation, thus focusing on the needs and requests of the customers.

Design Thinking

Define Prototype

Empathise Design Test

Design Thinking draws on the experience and versatility of the designers to deal with strategic
organizational planning with a less rigid perspective.

The multidisciplinary nature of the approaches of this type of innovation design is a distinctive
feature that makes it preferable to other more sectoral approaches that could represent a limit
to the innovation itself.

Design Thinking consists of 5 phases:

EMPHATHISE: What we are interested in
DEFINE: To define the objectives

DESIGN: What solution do | adopt
PROTOTYPE: How do | construct my solution
TEST: How do | check and improve my solution

ORWNER

Downstream of the prototyping and testing phase, a peer review is carried out which defines the
results obtained, and a gap analysis (what is missing in order to achieve the initial
specifications).

Successively the function/idea/architecture moves on into the hands of the Product Lines whose
objective is the complete development (in terms of integration and industrialisation) of the idea
in the direction of the final product, as defined in the Roadmap of the Strategic Technology Plan.
The R&l department manages most of the Company's private ventures. It has a staff of 18 with
skills in the engineering fields deemed to be key disciplines for the Company, and it has a
specific laboratory to carry out the demonstratorsâ€™ tests developed.

Partnerships with universities and research centres

Collaboration with research institutions and university design centres is a qualifying element of
our innovation process, which triggers a virtuous exchange both for the high value of knowledge
and skills put in place by the partners, and for the opportunity that Elettronica provides to the
world of research to develop innovative ideas and realize their potential by applying it to the
corporate business.
