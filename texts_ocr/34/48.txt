3.3
COMPANY AND DATA SECURITY

 

We operate in a sector in which the know-how and information we produce
and manage are important for the fact that they guarantee the security of
institutions and of civil society, therefore we adopt rigorous information and
data management systems and constantly maintain risk awareness and a
security mentality among our employees.

The protection of information

The adoption and implementation of an information security management system, through
obtaining ISO 27001: 2013 - Information Security Management certification, are aimed at
protecting the Company's intellectual capital and correctly managing critical and confidential
information, which also means protecting the security of civil society and of the state. In 2018,
the Company launched the integration of the IT incident management system through the
implementation of the ISO 27035: 2016 - Information Security Incident Management standard
and the introduction of a dedicated team, the Computer Security Incident Response Team
(CSIRT). We have also obtained

Cyber Essential certification, which is the reference standard for IT security in UK countries and
which has guided us in the adoption and application of the essential levels of IT security,
necessary to be able to deal with cyber attack threats. Information security depends not only on
the reliability and effectiveness of the management system, but also on awareness of the risks
and the common adoption of behaviours on the part of everyone who works for Elettronica. For
this reason, in 2019 we launched awareness actions to spread the main rules for protecting
personal and business data in digital format: classroom workshops, training pills on the e-
learning platform, “keep in mind” issues reported on the IT SECURITY portal AWARENESS
available on the Company Intranet. We also launched an internal awareness campaign on
phishing emails, since the e-mail channel is one of the most common vectors via which attempts
are made to steal information and it has become increasingly difficult to protect. Knowing how
to recognize a phishing email means protecting the Company, but also and above all ourselves,
from attempted attacks that can compromise the confidentiality of attractive data (passwords,
bank accounts, Company data, etc.). During the campaign, each employee was subjected to
fake attacks by phishing generated by our IT system. In this way, we tested, on a sample basis,
the level of people's resilience in order to increase awareness of all these issues. The protection
of Company information also requires the ability to track and control information flows. The
digital transformation project and its documentary sub-project go in this direction. A few months
after its launch, the new ECM (Enterprise Content Management) Document System has already
become an indispensable tool for some of the Company's key processes. All the process and
management standards are now managed by the ECM system, which is increasingly becoming
a part of everyone's daily life. The ECM is also being progressively enriched with new features,
thanks to the numerous ideas for improvement and integration: for example, it is possible to
manage and monitor the action plans that are triggered off by the audit activities, to manage
claims and to manage complex plans. Further developments in progress will allow the creation
of new functions for managing the documentary aspects connected to the Programmes and to
the Contracts, both active and passive, up to the full integration of the protocolled processes,
both incoming and outgoing.
