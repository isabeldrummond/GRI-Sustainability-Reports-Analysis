The Photo Contest

It is an opportunity for all employees to share a personal interest and to get involved,
participating in the Company's photographic competition with their own shots; the competition
topics and prizes change from year to year. In 2019, 71 employees participated and 5 were
winners, one for each category (Nature, landscapes and animals; Reportage and street photos;
Macro, still life and portraits; Selfies, Videos).

Work merit stars

The sense of family that the Company is committed to building is also strengthened by initiatives
aimed at rewarding employees who have distinguished themselves for their skill,
industriousness and moral conduct, promoting their candidacy for the “Stars of Merit Award”
presented by the President of the Republic. In addition, Elettronica holds an internal celebration
to colleagues who have achieved 40 years of work in the Company, when they are awarded a
medal to celebrate this important milestone.

Charity
Every year Elettronica, thanks above all to the particular sensitivity of the Presidency, pays

attention to charitable works. At Christmas, for example, it chooses a gift box and charitable
greeting cards, and on other occasions it supports non-profit organizations, local authorities or
organizations related to Armed forces. We organize or participate in donations and fund-raising
for research centres and associations, sometimes also extending to employees the possibility
of joining such organisations by donating a share of their salary. We also support art and culture
by funding academies and study centres in Italy and abroad.

Volunteer work

Since 1965, also on the initiative of Elettronica’s founder Fratalocchi, D.Eng., the Blood Donors
Group has been active, with the participation not only of employees, but also of their families
and friends. The group, with 217 members, is linked to AVIS (the Italian blood donors’
association). On the day dedicated to donation, in addition to the day of leave provided for by
law, breakfast is offered to all participants.
