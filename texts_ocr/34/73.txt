INNOVATION PROMOTION

 

We are aware that today's challenge is innovation and that our role asa
company, together with the institutions, is to help the country to face change,
directing it towards global growth.

Internally, we stimulate the sharing of innovative drive and we reward creativity.
The Company adheres to projects with a strong innovative impact and seizes
opportunities for the exchange of ideas with other players of the sector.

The Innovation Builder

With a view to effectively divulging, collecting and proposing activities and ideas for innovation
within the organization, in 2019 we established the figure of the Innovation Builder (IB). The IB
is an "innovation facilitator" who harmonizes, communicates and connects research activities
within the different areas of the Engineering - Research & Innovation department with all other
engineering areas.

Integrated teams of IBs are formed according to issue, and periodic meetings are held according
to a calendar established by the Research & Innovation IB, who acts as coordinator. The IB
teams can be extended to any corporate department according to the subject of the proposed
innovation. Each IB guarantees information and communication within his own department.

The Skip Level Meeting

As part of the Engineering function, the orientation towards innovation is also the result of a
continuous and structured sharing of information and the collection of feedback aimed at
increasing the synergy and collaboration between the departments, through a two-way
communication process that follows the logic of the Skip Level Meeting:

e to communicate top-down issues that are important for the Company on all fronts, with the
primary objective of expressing a vision that is as transversal as possible and which
increases collaboration between departments;

e for bottom-up communicating and to obtain direct feedback from resources, and for
comments on and the analysis of different issues

More specifically, the meetings involve about 300 people, divided into smaller groups of about
15.
