Health control is guaranteed by the Company in collaboration with Praxi DS and specialist
physicians, through ELT_Lab, the service dedicated to all employees who can have private
health tests and prevention packages, through Métasalute health insurance, at the in-house
clinic. Elettronica also has its own infirmary, open every day for 8 hours. It is also used by
employees for general and specialist medical examinations relative to disease, accidents, health
problems or just for information, facilitating those who, for occupational reasons, have difficulty
in terms of time to go to other health facilities for minor ailments. In addition, every year, the
infirmary administers the influenza vaccine, free of charge, to those who request it.
