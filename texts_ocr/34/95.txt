1 __ the first method, in continuity with the work carried out in the previous reports, was based on
Elettronica’s perception of the importance that stakeholders attribute to each issue -
according to the representatives of the organisational structure involved in the reporting
process and the information channels used by the Company for management purposes;

2 the second method illustrated the perspective of the supplier-stakeholders directly, through
structured involvement actions (See paragraph 2.4).

The Company's perspective was obtained by the creation of a focus group with the top
management, aimed at identifying the Social Responsibility issues with significance for
Elettronica, on the basis of those already covered in the previous social reporting processes and
the assessment of further issues to be considered on the basis of the ISO 26000:2010 guidelines,
keeping in mind the areas and stakeholders which are influenced by the Company’s decisions
and actions, as well as the way in which these aspects contribute to sustainable development.
Then, each top manager assigned a priority value to the issues identified and the average of these
evaluations made it possible to complete the Company's perspective on the materiality of each
relevant issue. The priorities were assigned on the basis of the value and strategic consistency
for Elettronica of the significant issues and of the related specific aspects, and of their influence
on the organization's ability to create economic, social and environmental value, also taking into
account what the Company has already carried out within the areas identified. For positioning in
the matrix, each relevant issue was assessed by the stakeholders (indirectly or directly) and by
the Company's top management on a scale of values from 1 to 3 (1 = low priority; 2 = medium
priority; 3 = high priority).

The issues that are positioned in the materiality matrix quadrant delimited by assigned values
greater than or equal to 2 (See par. 2.2 of the report).

The materiality matrix was submitted to the General Management for validation, before the
approval of the Sustainability Report by the Board of Directors.

The table on the facing page shows the list of material issues and their scope.

¢ Completeness: in the 2019 Social Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Elettronica
gives all useful information to allow stakeholders to assess the Company’s performance.
For each material issue, Elettronica’s vision is illustrated as well as the importance of the
issue within the Company, the management purpose and methods and - when available -
the resources invested, the specific actions and the initiatives put in place, the subjects
involved, the output produced, the results obtained, the impact generated and Elettronica’s
commitment on the issue in order to render its actions increasingly responsible and
sustainable. If the material issue is contemplated by an existing GRI Standard, Elettronica
reports the relative specific information; if the material issue is not covered by an existing
GRI Standard, Elettronica, with the support of the entire network of internal contact
persons, has identified appropriate and detailed information. In addition to the issues
identified as material, Elettronica reports on other relevant, albeit minor, issues in the
social responsibility and sustainability report.
