Our Values

Our values are found in what we are and achieve, in our
products and in our relationships, at all levels. For us this
means Coherence.

Sharing this system of values is a reason for unity,
strength and pride and guides us all together towards a
future with greater awareness.

[Innovation innovation The experience gained together with our customers makes us
concrete innovators, capable of anticipating the challenges of tomorrow, through continuous
research and the development of technologically advanced solutions. The enthusiasm
with which we explore reality, the ability to integrate scientific and industrial collaboration,
methods and processes, are distinguishing elements of the incessant evolution of our work.

Reliability In our sector, excellence is an absolute duty. Design, production and
assistance follow rigorous control procedures and continuous improvement processes, with
the aim of ensuring timely compliance with the specific needs of each customer and the
maximum reliability of our products, in any operating scenario.

Belonging Our most important asset is people. We believe in sharing and integration,
in diversity, in constant professional updating, in growth based on merit that passes through
the appreciation of commitment and talent. We work so that each of us can express our full
potential, aware of being active parts of the success of our Company and of our own lives.

Correctness we firmly believe that compliance with rules represents a guarantee of
stable and lasting relationships in all the countries in which we operate. Honesty, transparency
and responsibility are fundamental prerequisites for our way of working, both internally and in
the interaction with our partners and our customers, because mutual trust is a primary asset
which we foster and protect.

Dynamism To respect the rules and procedures, we combine initiative, flexibility
and resourcefulness, balancing rapid decision-making processes with effective control
mechanisms. Because of the fluidity of the contexts of reference and our propensity for
innovation, our work organization systems are always streamlined and our relationships with
partners and customers are always pro-active. Ours is a dynamic balance, composed of
coordination and change.
