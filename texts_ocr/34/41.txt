The particular type of work performed by the Company - based on programmes - requires, in the
technical and operational sphere, figures that are involved in all organisational sectors, in order to
effectively coordinate the activities and ensure the necessary alignment of objectives, times, costs
and quality among the various programs. It has inter-departmental teams dedicated to “continuous
improvement” (BELT Shipyards - Building ELT of Tomorrow), comprising people of different levels
and qualifications, with the aim of examining specific issues from different points of view: this work
method produces important results and creates synergy between the departments.
