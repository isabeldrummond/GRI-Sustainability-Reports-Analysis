The Innovation Award

We stimulate and reward creativity and commitment within the Company, organizing a two-year
competition for employees, as individuals or in groups, who present a project which is, precisely,
innovative. The works are judged by a commission whose internal members include the Director
General and the Chief Scientist.

In addition to an economic recognition, the winning projects have the chance of being published
in international engineering journals, according to the highest IEEE standards. In the case of
projects that contain innovations of particular interest to the business and of immediate
application for the Company, the Director General will provide for the relative financing. In
addition, for especially innovative and potentially distinctive ideas of products/services, patent
registration is proposed, with a strong motivational impact on the authors of the innovation itself.

MIND - Milan Innovation District

Elettronica is part of "an innovation ecosystem, a catalyst of opportunities for the socio-economic
growth of the country" through participation in the MIND redevelopment project of the Milan Expo
Area, which aims to establish a sustainable ecosystem which can bring to light a new community
and represent an exemplary model for the future urban regenerations of the world.

MIND will become a new district of Milan: a real city within the city which looks to the future with
a vision that combines scientific, academic and environmental protection aspects. In 2019 a
Memorandum of Understanding was signed by 55 companies involved regarding two lines of
development: Life science and the City of the Future. Elettronica is involved on the second line
- the City of the Future - relative to which it plans to open an office within 2020 for technological
scouting activities.

The Digital Innovation Hub project

Weare participating in the Confindustria Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) project by joining the Lazio

Digital Innovation Hub, together with other players of the local innovation ecosystem. The DIHs

have the task of stimulating and promoting the demand for innovation in the production system,

strengthening the level of knowledge and of the awareness of the opportunities offered by

digitalization which represent the "gateway" for companies to enter the world of Industry 4.0. In

particular, the activities carried out by DIHs for companies focus on:

e raising awareness and training with regard to opportunities related to the application of 4.0
technologies, through the organization of seminars, workshops and study visits

e digital maturity assessment: support in the use of digital maturity assessment tools,
definition of the roadmap for the digital transformation of business processes and
accompaniment in the development of 4.0 projects

e orientation towards the ecosystem of innovation: national and European competence
centres, smart factories and demo centres, lighthouse factories, universities, technology
parks and clusters, public and private research centres, technology transfer centres,
incubators and fablabs.

 

By joining the project, Elettronica makes its skills available to the territory, contributes to osmosis
on innovation issues and, at the same time, expands its relationships and develops its business.

Participation in conferences and events

In Elettronica, dialogue and debate with the institutions and other companies operating in the
sector represent an important opportunity to contribute to reflection on issues deemed crucial
for the development and growth of the entire sector.

To this end, we participate in conferences and events in which the theme of innovation has a
crucial role.
