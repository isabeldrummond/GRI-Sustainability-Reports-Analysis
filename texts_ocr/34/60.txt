Communication and involvement

Knowing and knowing oneself are the fundamental prerequisites for a good
internal environment. For this reason, we have prepared tools, organized
activities and provided areas that favour integration between employees.

Sharing information

The starting point for internal sharing is ELTnet, the Company’s Intranet, an informative
summary of the world of Elettronica, which contains all the documentation useful for
everyone’s job -

- and not only: external and Company regulations, press releases, forms for requesting
services, information on CRAL (the Company's recreational club for employees) activities, and
the daily refectory menus.

The FELT newsletter is the informative house organ, designed as a tool for sharing but also for
aggregation: it gives voice to, and expresses the enthusiasm of, the different generations
present in the Company. It is a newsletter that looks towards the future, but always keeps the
Company's traditions alive. It gives information on main events (fairs, exhibitions, technological
innovations, internal events, business successes ...) and also deals with corporate themes that
favour the spread of a unique and shared culture and style. An average of 6 employees per
single issue collaborate in the preparation of the newsletter, and in 2019 24 employees
contributed to the 4 editions published.

ELTogether is an annual social event for the entire organisation, during which the results
achieved by the Company and the corporate strategies for the forthcoming years are
communicated by the top management to all the personnel. Every year we introduce an
element of novelty into the event, which can be entertaining and fun for the audience of
employees.

The 2019 ELTogether, dedicated to Christmas, was unforgettable. The Elettronica
headquarters was turned into a magical Christmas Village where the typical joy of Christmas
and the characteristic atmosphere of food trucks transformed the event into an unforgettable
celebration. The event then continued with street and finger food tastings, with the

involvement of everyone in the SelfieBox stations that allowed the guests to take, print and
distribute amusing photographs via the web and the social media, then used as souvenir
gadgets of the event.

Socialising

Elettronica supports initiatives such as the CRAL, which represents a meeting point for all
those who wish to meet and share interests, during work breaks and in their free time. We
have always welcomed all employees, enrolling them automatically and free of charge when
they are hired. In recent years, to facilitate and hold all CRAL activities in a new environment,
the area dedicated to the initiative has been redeveloped, restructured and named after the
founder of the Company Filippo Fratalocchi. In 2019, however, the new Statute was approved
which contains certain variations of the internal organization of CRAL, aimed at making the
structure increasingly modern and suitable for the new needs of the corporate population.
CRAL offers sports activities, organized trips, dinners and food and wine tastings and cultural
activities, as well as special agreements with external bodies, which also involve family
members. It is available to employees who wish to share interests and hobbies, through self-
managed courses that vary from photography to wine tasting.
