We have also understood, in our continuous projection towards the market, the importance and
the need to be closer to customers, opening commercial offices in the countries in which we
operate. This allows us to maintain a constant dialogue, to avoid communication problems and
to offer the fast reaction that customers now expect. All our current and future customers
request, indeed they demand, Elettronica to be their Technological Partner, a partner that knows
how to put current and future technologies and research and development capacity at the
service of their operational needs. For this reason we participate in the various NATO Groups
that determine the technological and scenario trends with which our Customers will have to
deal. In this way, we provide global support to our stakeholders, convinced that the success of
a system lies in the combination of technologies, human skills and customer satisfaction.

7.2
CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND CUSTOMER
SATISFACTION

 

Customer satisfaction is an essential element of our work: _ the basis of the relationship
and the trust involved created by constant and punctual technical assistance in the field
and a continuous process of listening and evaluation, in order to identify action for
continuous improvement.

Customer attention involves an effective Customer Support process. In this context, Elettronica
guarantees customer satisfaction by ensuring the operational effectiveness of the products
delivered within the contractual deadlines, by:

* assessing all aspects of the needs that ensure, already in the design and development
phase (Design for Supportability), the performance of the products over time

¢ instruction and training in the use and maintenance of the products

¢ — the definition and budgeting of solutions to ensure the operational efficiency of the system
and relative performance (In Service Support - ISS)

¢ — the definition and budgeting of integrated "turnkey" solutions for logistic support already in
the first supply phase

¢« Maintenance, Repair and Overhauling activities, with on-site support, in-house
maintenance and continuous improvement of the products based on the feedback
received

¢ — the development of customized training solutions

¢ — the monitoring of the obsolescence management process, in synergy with the other
processes involved in the creation of the product.

Furthermore, during the warranty and Follow On Support period, the customer is actively
assisted, directly by on-site technical assistance in the use and maintenance of the systems and
indirectly by the response to specific technical requests (Query- Answering).

As well as the execution of maintenance in compliance with the programmed contractual
deadlines.
