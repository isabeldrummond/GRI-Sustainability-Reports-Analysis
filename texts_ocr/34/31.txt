Environment

We recognize the global importance of environmental sustainability, even though we operate in a
sector that does not have a strong impact on the issue.

We plan and put in place practical measures to reduce the environmental impact generated by our
activities and raise awareness among our employees and those who act within our sphere of
influence; we direct our efforts towards the responsible management of energy resources in order
to reduce consumption and emissions into the air, using renewable sources whenever possible; we
give importance to the water cycle and to waste management and we promote forms of sustainable
mobility within the Company.

We supervise any activities involving the possibility of environmental risks, including such risks into
our Corporate Risk Management system and we always measure, record and report our impact in
a structured manner.

Correct management practices
We maintain relationships with other organisations and with our stakeholders based on principles of

correctness and transparency.

We have adopted rules, systems and processes that allow us to pursue our objectives in compliance
with the law. We put in place initiatives to ensure coherence between what is declared and what is
actually carried out, with full respect for rules and standards also in practice, ensuring compliance.

Through procurement and supply chain management policies, we promote economic, social and
environmental sustainability in the value chain.

We foster continuous improvement on the part of our suppliers and encourage their active
participation in innovation processes, giving value to their skills and promoting the achievement of
excellence. We put in the field tools and solutions aimed at supporting our suppliers’ growth and
economic stability and at facilitating the creation of a network of suppliers’ which also collaborate
with each other.

Responsibility towards customers

In a complex and dynamic sector such that in which we operate, it is necessary to define scenarios
in order to anticipate needs and detect real needs and requirements. Operating in the sector of
defence means constantly striving to produce and promote innovation, and thus to guarantee
concrete solutions for the defence and security of the population and of the country's system. In
relation with our customers, we go beyond the traditional contractual relationship, establishing a
partnership based on profound, fruitful collaboration and, at the same time, we protect the security
and the confidentiality of the information regarding them.

We are committed to accompanying the customer throughout the entire life cycle of the product,
from the offer to the definition of the contract, providing for training, guaranteeing operational support
as well as dedicated and immediate customer service.

We market solutions and products, but we also transfer know-how and skills to our customers,
through activities and training initiatives.

 

Community involvement
We share interests, needs and objectives with the community in the area in which we operate. We

direct our efforts towards building networks with other local players to create projects that improve
the conditions of the context of reference, creating opportunities for the expression of excellence to
facilitate interaction and to create mutually beneficial synergies between the world of industry,
universities and schools. Together with our employees, we contribute to the well-being of the
community through voluntary and charity initiatives.
