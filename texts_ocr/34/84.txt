The key role recognized to our suppliers

To establish stable, efficient and sustainable relationships with national suppliers not only means
achieving excellent and reliable performance, but it also involves a significant impact on the
economic, employment and social fabric. Elettronica prefers national and local suppliers, aware
of the importance of a solid and competitive national industrial supply chain, to face the
challenges of the global market.

Results of supplier involvement: sharing and recognition

Innovation is essential to avoid losing competitiveness and opportunities: the Elettronica supply
chain is convinced of this, aware of the Company's leadership to this regard, but also of its role
as promoters and producers of innovation.

The approach to the customer is equally shared: an attention aimed at intercepting needs and
transforming them into solutions, through the ability of Elettronica and its supply chain to produce
innovation.

To bring the skills of the supply chain closer to the needs of customers and vice versa, and to
render concrete the role of supplier-partner, it is considered necessary to be involved upstream
of the innovation planning and production processes and to recognize one's own commitment
to research and development.

Sharing is recognised as a key to the success of Elettronica and its supply chain; therefore
Elettronica organises workshops with suppliers on issues deriving from the output of the
activities of the Technological Table.
