Letter to the Stakeholders

We are proud to publish the new Social Responsibility Report, the document that testifies
to the direction and path of continuous improvement followed by Elettronica in the field of
sustainability and responsible action.

In 2016 we started with the idea that our choices and our activities had to be inspired by
the principles of Social Responsibility, on the basis of which we set off on a real journey that
allowed us to deepen the areas of our commitment.

Over time we have identified the elements for improvement and for making Social
Responsibility a qualifying element, to be brought to the fore and shared with our
stakeholders and to be integrated in an increasingly structured way into our behaviour,
policies and actions.

A path that has allowed us, in recent years, to draw up increasingly accurate and complete
social budgets, but above all to involve the stakeholders on specific Social Responsibility
and Sustainability issues, with the definition and adoption of our Policy in which to declare
the Company's vision and commitment, always favouring an increasingly strategic and
integrated approach.

In 2019 we focused on the decisive transition from Social Responsibility reporting to
Social Responsibility programming, having become aware of our role, of the potential of
our contribution to sustainable economic development and of the need to pay maximum
attention to the interests and expectations of our main stakeholders.

We listened to our suppliers, asking for suggestions and ideas to improve our social
reporting, but also to plan and integrate actions based on their expectations, to grow
together in innovation, technology and skills.

Together with Elettronicaâ€™s Top Management, we share a common idea of and commitment
to Social Responsibility, defining priorities, objectives and concrete actions to be put in
place.

With our activities, we are contributing to the implementation of the United Nations 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development, focusing in particular on: the promotion and
production of innovation, to be shared with universities, research bodies, suppliers and
customers, in an open innovation logic; the development of skills and on welfare, to
encourage stable employment, creating a work environment in which everyone is respected
and valued, seeking solutions to improve the well-being of all; competitiveness by means
of a sustainable production and consumption model that generates efficiency and reduces
environmental impact; and Rules, to ensure fairness, reliability and quality over time.

We will continue in this direction, also expanding the involvement to all our employees, to

make them even more active as protagonists on the path followed by Elettronica towards a
business model increasingly in step with the changing world.
