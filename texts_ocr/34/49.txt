The protection of personal data: a privacy-oriented model

In addition to complying with the special regulations on the protection of national security, it is also
our duty to respect and enforce the Privacy discipline according to which the protection of people is
a priority, with particular reference to the right to the protection of personal data, to informational
self-determination, and to non-discrimination. The Company has adopted a “privacy oriented”
model: the challenge is to ensure that the data processing processes are structurally and intrinsically
preordained to protect privacy.

implementation guidelines of the New European Privacy Regulation and the Privacy Code revised
according to Legislative Decree 101/2018 (the so-called harmonization decree) and providing for
the extension of the ISO 27001 controls to the field of privacy, thus allowing the adaptation of the
Privacy Management System to the recently published ISO 27701: 2019 to be programmed.
