Supplier pre-qualification and qualification

The procedure for a company to qualify as an Elettronica supplier is intended to assess and
check the ethical, legal, economic and financial solidity aspects, as well as its capability
(technical skills) and capacity (availability of resources and machines). The assessment that
does not end with the accreditation but continues over time, through monitoring and constant
assessment of the maintenance and improvement of the requirements for accreditation, as
well as the supplier's dependence on existing contracts with Elettronica. In this way, the
supply chain is guaranteed as regards several aspects: state of health, reliability, orientation
towards excellence, but also orientation towards ethics and legality. To start the pre-
qualification process, the potential supplier must accept the Code of Conduct, the Anti-
corruption Code and the Privacy Policy.

 

 

Code of Conduct for Suppliers

The first condition for being included on the Elettronica Suppliers Register is therefore
the acceptance of the Code of Conduct for Suppliers: a method that Elettronica has
chosen

to ensure that its suppliers share the values and conduct that inspire and discipline how
the Company acts. |The Code of Conduct adopted incorporates the principles that
inspire economic, social and environmental sustainability, in line with international best
practices.

The Code of Conduct establishes the fundamental rules and practices that we expect from our
suppliers on sensitive issues ranging from human rights to equal opportunities, from anti-
corruption to compliance with import/export rules, from health and safety in the workplace to
respect for the environment.

Principles of the code of conduct for suppliers

e Protection of the human rights of its own employees, treating them with dignity and respect
and promoting their employment stability

e The offer of equal employment opportunities to employees and candidates without
discrimination

e Compliance with laws to prevent corruption, illegal payments, fraud and deception, unfair

competition, gifts/unjustified benefits

Compliance with import / export rules

To provide a safe and healthy working environment

To operate responsibly and efficiently from an environmental point of view

Integration of quality in business processes and the implementation of management

systems that facilitate compliance with applicable laws

We firmly believe in the principles expressed in our Code of Conduct for suppliers. Therefore, in
addition to publishing the text on the Suppliersâ€™ Portal, we have decided to hold workshops in
which to further underline these concepts.

The Portal is a tool that allows the efficient and effective sharing of information between
Elettronica and its suppliers. It is a "door" open to the outside world, which also offers small and
medium-sized companies the possibility of making themselves known and of proposing
themselves as partners of our Company.
