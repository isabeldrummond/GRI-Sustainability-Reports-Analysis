INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
to the Shareholders of Palladio Ireland Packaging Solutions Limited

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Opinion

| have audited the financial statements of Palladio Ireland Packaging Solutions Limited (‘the company’) for the year
ended 31 December 2018 which comprise the Profit and Loss Account, the Balance Sheet, the Reconciliation of
Shareholders’ Funds and the related notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting
policies set out in note 2. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is Irish Law
and FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, applying Section 1A
of that Standard.

In my opinion the financial statements:

- give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the company as at 31 December 2018
and of its profit for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with FRS 102 "The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the
UK and Republic of Ireland”, applying Section 1A of that Standard; and

- have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2014.

Basis for opinion

| conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) (ISAs (Ireland) and applicable
law. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of my report. | am independent of the company in accordance with ethical
requirements that are relevant to my audit of financial statements in Ireland, including the Ethical Standard for
Auditors (Ireland) issued by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), and the Provisions
Available for Audits of Small Entities, in the circumstances set out in note 3 to the financial statements, and | have
fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. | believe that the audit evidence |
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern

| have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (Ireland) require me to report to

you where:

- the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or

- the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast
significant doubt about the company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a
period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Other Information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the annual report other than the financial statements and my Auditor's Report thereon. My opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in my report, | do
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

in connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing
‘so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge
obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If | identify such material inconsistencies or
apparent material misstatements, | am required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work | have performed, | conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, | am required to report that fact. | have nothing to
report in this regard.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2014

Based solely on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, | report that:

- in our opinion, the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- in my opinion, the Directors' Report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2014.

| have obtained all the information and explanations which | consider necessary for the purposes of my audit.

In my opinion the accounting records of the company were sufficient to permit the financial statements to be readily

and properly audited. The financial statements are in agreement with the accounting records.

Matters on which | am required to report by exception

Based on the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, |
have not identified any material misstatements in the Directors’ Report. The Companies Act 2014 requires me to
report to you if, in my opinion, the disclosures of directors’ remuneration and transactions required by sections 305 to
312 of the Act are not made. | have nothing to report in this regard.
