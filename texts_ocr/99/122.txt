INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

TO THE OWNERS OF PALLADIO EAST DOO VRSAC

Report on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Palladio east doo Vrsac (hereinafter: the Company),
which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2018, and the income statement, statement of other
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with the Law on Accounting and other accounting regulations in the Republic of Serbia, and for such
internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing applicable in the Republic of Serbia. Those standards require
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those
risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal
control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.
