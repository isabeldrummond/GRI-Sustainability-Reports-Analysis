Industrial relations

 

In order to guarantee employees fair, safe, accessible and sustainable workplaces and working
conditions, it is essential to maintain an effective industrial relations system. Over the years, the Group
has established a fruitful dialogue with the trade unions, in order to find the best solutions to reconcile
people's needs with those of the business, guaranteeing every employee a transparent employment
relationship and the full protection of his/her rights, regardless of the form of the contract that is
characterised by the countries in which he/she works.

 

Industrial relations between the business and employeesâ€™ representatives involve periodic meetings,
during which a review is conducted of the trend in the Group's results and financial position, as well
as of specific issues, such as occupational health and safety (analysis of injuries, near misses and
processes for improvement of working conditions), training and the development of skills.

Relations with the unions are characterised by a generally constructive climate, by means of open and
dialectical discussions of various issues, in full respect of people and their ideas, with recognition that
only the contribution of each person involved would ensure solutions designed to face a rapidly
evolving reality such as the current one. During the course of 2019, involvement, the sharing of
information and the pursuit of agreements with the trade unions have been instrumental in handling
potentially critical emerging issues, associated with the market and certain significant changes to the
regulatory framework in which the Group operates.

In addition to their customary role of sitting at negotiating tables, trade union representatives are often
directly involved in organisational improvement processes.

As far as the Italian Group companies are concerned, it should be noted that 100% of employees are
covered by collective labour agreements.

Corporate welfare

Due to the fact that the Group is attentive to the wellbeing and quality of life of its employees, it has
committed to planning actions to improve employee satisfaction and the corporate climate, by
focusing on numerous initiatives concerning corporate welfare.

The preparation of a good welfare plan helps to reward and retain employees, makes the business
more attractive to new candidates and guarantees appropriate management of internal relations, thus
improving the working environment.

As part of the corporate welfare plan, all Italian employees are offered the chance to choose from a
series of tax-exempt services related to health, wellbeing, education, recreation, sport and travel. In
addition to the payment of annual amounts due for the three-year period 2017-2019, the corporate
welfare plan, which is targeted at all blue collar workers, office workers and middle managers
