Process innovation

Biesse Group has implemented a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) platform, as part of an
innovation project aimed at improving the management of the lifespan of products through a software
solution that enables the integration of data, processes and business systems, in synergy with the
user. The PLM Team Centre platform enables the efficient and effective management of information
along the entire lifespan of a product, from its conception to its design and from its production to
support therefor.

As part of its strategic vision, the adoption of the PLM system forms part of the Group's digital
transformation process and is designed to support Lean production and Kaizen principles, which are
working methodologies implemented in 2007 and that are being gradually extended within the
organisation, in the pursuit of cultural change and constant improvement along the entire value chain,
rom the factory, to suppliers and to the end customer.

The Group encourages a lean approach and culture along the entire value chain so that everyone is
motivated and that processes are lean, timed and consistent with the demands of the market, with
the objective of improving quality, guaranteeing certainty in delivery times and waste reduction.

The concept of lean innovation, which is traditionally associated with manufacturing processes, is
being increasingly extended to indirect and support functions.

 

The need to transfer lean methods and tools “from the factory to the offices” has brought about an
extension of internal training being offered with the development of a new "Lean Office" course that
focuses on white collar staff.

Regarding kaizen measures implemented during the course of 2019 for the Mechatronics Division's
supply chain, there has been a decrease in the value of finished product inventory of 11% with a
consequent reduction in occupied space of 13% and in internal transport of 44%. At the same time, as
regards indirect processes, especially that for the procurement of materials for new products, the
measures implemented have led to a recovery of efficiency of 54% and a reduction in lead times of
33% and of tools used of 22%.

 

Furthermore, in 2019, a new vertical warehouse was installed at the Pesaro campus, resulting in an
increase in the efficiency of logistics processes and the optimisation of action, time and space, as well
as enabling employees to work in an ergonomic and safe manner.
