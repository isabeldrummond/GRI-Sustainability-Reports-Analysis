products), VDMA (German association for mechanical engineering in Europe), GIMAV (Italian
association of suppliers of machinery and accessories for glass processing), Confindustria
Marmomacchine (Association of manufacturers of ornamental marble, granite and stone and of
machinery, tools and equipment for the processing thereof) and AMAPLAST (Association of
manufacturers of machinery and moulds for plastic and rubber materials).

Biesse Group's ability to innovate and leverage its knowhow for strategic success can be measured
by factors such as the number of patents deposited. The Group currently has approximately 200
patents, which have contributed to the innovation of technological solutions present in the wood, glass
and stone processing machinery market. During the course of 2019, further patent applications were
filed relating to new functions in machinery being designed and/or systems for the improvement of
machinery safety.

The customers, in particular, are protagonists of the process encompassing research, experimental
development and implementation of new technologies. Customers’ needs and requirements always
present us with new technological and design challenges that enable us to constantly customise,
update and improve the Group's machinery and solutions.

Some of the main significant innovations in terms of product sustainability generated by the Group
are geared towards the implementation of machinery that is safer for the operator, easier to use and
more efficient in terms of energy consumption, but which maintain high quality standards.

From the product to the Industrial Internet of Things

Biesse constantly invests in the world of software and advanced services, by developing easy to use
solutions conceived by listening to customers and their needs, with a simple interface, designed to
make everyday use of machinery practical. B-Suite, in particular, is a coordinated advanced set of
software tools that enables anyone to gain access to the latest cutting-edge technologies offered by
the Group.

Driven by the basic principle of Industrial Revolution 4.0, the Group has introduced notable innovations
and achieved significant results in the development of new technologies that enable connectivity
between machines, as well as self-diagnosis that helps to identify potential issues and to improve the
predictive maintenance process, as part of the Industrial Internet of Things (IloT).

In this regard, the SOPHIA platform is based on the connection of Biesse's machinery to Microsoft's
Azure cloud, making it possible to collect real time data and information on technologies being used
to optimise the performance and productivity of the machinery and systems. In fact, the data collected
makes it possible to analyse the functionality of the systems, to identify any malfunctions and to assist
customers with preventive maintenance to prevent breakdowns, thus minimising any interruption to
the manufacturing process.

By means of the direct connection to Parts, the Group's spare parts portal, the platform facilitates the
simple and efficient management of spare parts, guaranteeing constant assistance and quality to all
its customers. Accordingly, the IloT solution has become an integral part of Biesse's products in order
to offer customers more value from the machinery.

A significant IloT innovation was the creation, by HSD, of the first Wi-Fi connected electrospindle
(patent pending), winner of the “SMAU Milan Innovation Award 2019”. This electrospindle, which
communicates via an app, helps the user to monitor the component, ensuring quicker and cheaper
maintenance, accurate and speedy diagnosis and increased safety and flexibility of its use.
