maintaining a constructive collaborative
relationship that serves the interests of the
community.

Biesse Group has established a constructive
dialogue with the trade unions, aimed at the
complete protection of workersâ€™ rights in the
context of activities carried out in the name of
or on behalf of the Group.

The Group is attentive to the needs of the local
areas in which it operates and acts with a view
to extending the positive externalities of its
activities to local communities. Moreover,
every year the Group is committed to the
promotion of philanthropic initiatives. To this
end, it listens to the requests and expectations
of organisations active in different areas and
collaborates with them in the support of local
communities.

The Group fosters a participatory dialogue
with national and international universities,
training schools and research centres and
develops, with their contribution, projects of
common interest to facilitate the entry of
young people into the world of work and to
seek new technologies and/or business
practices.
