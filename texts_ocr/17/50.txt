experienced men and women, combined with the enthusiasm of those who are setting out on their
professional development path.

In contrast to youth unemployment figures relating to the main countries in which the Group operates,
Biesse Group has hired, in the three-year period 2017-2019, 503 young people under the age of 35 that
account for approximately 12.8 % of the overall workforce at 31 December 2019.

The recruitment of young people by the Group contributes significantly to the achievement of the
following three strategic objectives:

e digital mindset: Biesse machinery has a software soul that becomes digital when in contact with
customers. Young colleagues that have grown up in a connected world can contribute to nurturing
this culture that has been confirmed to be a distinctive feature of the Group's offering;

e internationality: 80% of the Group's customers are located abroad. Familiarity with international
cultures is essential to be able to establish solid relationships between the central functions, which
govern the conception and design of technological solutions, and customers who operate in
markets with differing characteristics. The recruitment of resources with international study
experience makes it possible to shorten the distance between Biesse and its customers;

e innovation: the recruitment of young people facilitates and speeds up the identification of
innovative technologies and processes.

The main talent attraction and selection strategies implemented by the Group include multiple
activities carried out in cooperation with academic institutes at national level. Cooperation with
educational institutions enables the Group to make new contacts and to activate a preferential
channel for the recruitment of young people. Biesse Group has always cultivated relationships with
local technical institutes, in order to select the best resources, who are motivated to undertake a career
path after having obtained their diploma. Biesse Group thus acts as a knowledge activator in the
locality where most of its design and creation of solutions is undertaken. In this regard, specific
recruitment activities are conducted in the main local technical and professional institutes to meet
youngsters about to obtain their diploma and to invite them to a selection day for a mini-assessment,
which is tailored according to the profiles sought.

Lectures, seminars and career days are some of the activities conducted on the premises of the main
Italian universities. The selection of young talent takes place via assessment sessions, in which
candidates are subjected to psycho-aptitude tests and self-presentations. After having passed the
selection process, new hires receive on-the-job training by working alongside more senior colleagues
and attend training courses in specific academies. With a view to future growth and improvement,
during the course of 2019, "Internal Job Posting‚Äù was launched, being a process designed to
encourage the mobility of personnel within the Group and to allow all employees to take advantage of
professional opportunities being offered in order to encourage transfers between departments and
operating facilities.
