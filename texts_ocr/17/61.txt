communities in which it operates. It is committed to the promotion of social and cultural initiatives, it
has a preference for collaborations aimed at supporting training and the locality, while paying
particular attention to projects focused on children, youth and culture.

Social commitment
The main social initiatives promoted by the Group in 2019 are the following:

The educational value of sport

Biesse Group believes in the importance of promoting sports culture as an educational and
aggregative element for young people, thus offering them an opportunity to engage and test
themselves, in a healthy and constructive manner. For this reason, the Group has confirmed its
support for various local sports clubs, with a particular focus on youth. In 2019, it actively supported
Team Vis Sauro Nuoto (swimming team), Victoria Libertas pallacanestro (basketball team), Bees
basket, Pesaro rugby, Robursport women's volleyball team, GS Muraglia Calcio (football team), VIS
Pesaro (football team) and other sports clubs.

Support to “I bambini delle fate”

Via the “I bambini delle fate” association, the Group supports social inclusion projects aimed at
families with autism and other disabilities, thus contributing to the dissemination of a new vision for
diversity and inclusion.

Fight against waste in collaboration with Banco Alimentare and Caritas

Thanks to an active contribution by Banco Alimentare and Caritas, unconsumed food in the company
canteen on the Pesaro Campus is recovered under a project inspired by circular economy models,
thus fighting waste and making good use of food that would otherwise have been discarded. Banco
Alimentare recovers hot meals, bread, desserts, fruit and vegetables from the company canteen three
times a week and, thanks to its volunteers, it redistributes them locally the same day, thus offering
tangible, constant support to the needy. Thanks to a constant relationship with the Group, Caritas also
collects, on a daily basis, excess food from the canteen, by means of which it provides support to
“Casa Tabanelli”, an emergency reception centre located in Pesaro, thus guaranteeing a meal every
day to the centre's guests. During the course of 2019, approximately 14,000 complete meals were
recovered.
