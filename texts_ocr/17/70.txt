ZBIESSEGROUP

Emissions of COz

Biesse Group, which is aware of the adverse impact arising from climate change, constantly tracks its
direct and indirect emissions:

Direct emissions (Scope 1) arising
from operation of plant and
machinery owned by the business,
such as heating systems

Indirect emissions (Scope 2) arising
from the generation of electricity
purchased and consumed by the

organisation

(consumption of natural gas), diesel
fuel systems, company pool cars and
air conditioning systems.

 

In particular, as regards direct emissions (Scope 1), Biesse Group produced a total of approximately
6,381 tonnes of COze, in line with the previous year.

In relation to indirect emissions (Scope 2), emissions of CO2 produced amount to approximately
9,100 tonnes (market based method).

With particular reference to the management of direct emissions, note that the Group has adopted a
specific policy on pooled purchasing of company car fleets that requires new car purchases to be
assessed based on their average CO2 atmospheric emissions value.

30 Conversion factors used for the computation of 2019 Scope 1 emissions are based on 2019 UK Government GHG
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting.
31Scope 2 emissions are expressed in tonnes of COz, although, according to relevant technical literature, the percentage
included for natural gas and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on total greenhouse gas emissions (COz equivalent).
32 For the purpose of the computation of 2019 Scope 2 emissions (location based method), use was made of the emission
factors indicated by Terna's 2017 International comparison (figures at 31 December).
33 For the purpose of the computation of 2019 Scope 2 emissions (market based method), use was made of the emission
factors indicated by AIB's European Residual Mixes 2018 for European countries and the emission factors indicated in the
previous note for the other countries in which Biesse Group operates.
