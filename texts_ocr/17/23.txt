Approach to sustainability

Background

On 25 September 2015, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the new Agenda 2030
for Sustainable Development: an action programme to eradicate extreme poverty, reduce inequality
and protect the environment. The Agenda identifies 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be
reached by 2030 and recognises the indispensable role of the private sector for their achievement’.
The SDGs replace the previous Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and constitute a new global
point of reference that will provide guidance for policies, investment and specific projects in the near
future for wellbeing for all, respect for the planet and what it provides to us, prosperity in harmony with
nature and the promotion of peaceful, just and inclusive societies, as well as global collaboration and
solidarity.

As regards progress concerning the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs)
published by the United Nations, there are still notable differences between countries regarding the
goals. The 2019 Sustainable Development Goals Report highlights notable differences concerning the
degree of achievement of the SDGs around the world. Specifically, although there has been some
progress globally, such as the fight for the eradication of extreme poverty, there are many areas for
which acceleration will be needed, such as the use of natural resources’.

As far as Italy is concerned, the report on the status of compliance with the SDGs prepared by Asvis
highlights both delays and positive progress in relation to commitments assumed concerning the
green economy, the circular economy and the fight against inequality, including gender-related
inequality?. Regarding occupational health and safety, according to data released by INAIL for 2019,
