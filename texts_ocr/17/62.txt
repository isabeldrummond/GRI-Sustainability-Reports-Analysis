At Christmas, Biesse Group renewed its support to the earthquake-hit zones of Central Italy in
partnership with Fondazione Francesca Rava - N.P.H. Italia Onlus, by supporting a further
reconstruction project, a multipurpose centre in Pieve Torina, designed to provide its citizens with safe,
beautiful and useful structures for a return to daily life and wellbeing, to be used for school activities
and as a civic centre open to its citizens. Moreover, the Group has decided to support via a donation
to A..D.0., a non-profit organisation, which, for forty years, by means of transplant medicine,
contributes to saving the lives of thousands of people.

During the course of 2019, Biesse Manufacturing, in collaboration with Bangalore University and SIP
