potential effects of this phenomenon to the financial statement cannot be predicted to date and will
be constantly monitored later in the year.

Biesse, on the basis of these recent events, is putting in place actions aimed at reducing costs, with
particular reference to labor costs reduction. The current trend in orders of the business sector
(common to all the main competitors of Biesse) suggests that the actions currently in the definition
phase should be kept in place at least until mid-year 2020. This will allow to minimize the effects of
the reduction in revenues on the Group’s profitability, which is however expected to reduce. The Biesse
board of directors is however convinced that the company is, by strategy, organization, management
and financial strength, ready to overcome this acute phase of the cycle.
