The customer experience: The Biesse Campus

In line with its strategic plan, Biesse Group invests in customer support services through increasingly
more active participation at trade fairs and events and with the launch of new Campuses around the
world. The traditional showroom has evolved and has transformed itself from a display of machinery
to a place to be experienced, by means of seminars and training courses, combined with general and
customised technical tests of the Group's machinery. During the course of 2019, Campuses were
inaugurated for the Biesse Group Australia and Biesse Group Deutschland subsidiaries, whereas in
2020 anew Campus will be inaugurated for Biesse Russia.
