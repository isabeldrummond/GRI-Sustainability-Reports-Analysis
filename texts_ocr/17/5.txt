Sustainability risks

As disclosed in the NFS, by means of the enterprise risk management (ERM) process, Biesse Group
intends to improve the risk/opportunities identification process, by setting up a reliable model for
decision-making and strategic planning designed to improve the quality of the business processes.
With a view to continuous improvement, the Group has continued its analysis of the most significant
risks linked to sustainability issues, relating to the areas identified by Legislative Decree 254/2016, in
line with those already identified and agreed with the main control bodies for enterprise risk
management purposes. In particular, the Group will perform an increasingly more in-depth analysis of
risks concerning climate change in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Environment

The Group is committed to the constant pursuit of solutions aimed at ensuring responsible use of
natural resources, greater efficiency in energy consumption and the management of atmospheric
emissions. For this reason, Biesse Group plans to implement a project aimed at contributing positively
to the protection and preservation of the environment through the gradual development of a
structured continuous energy carrier monitoring system and the power factor correction of energy
intensive machinery, as well as the rationalisation of the exploitation of water resources.

As a sign of the Group's commitment to contribute to a sustainable, decarbonised economy, effective
2020, in addition to strengthening its existing energy efficiency improvement schemes, most of the
Italian companies will purchase energy from GO (guarantee of origin) certified renewable sources,
with the aim of significantly reducing indirect CO2 emissions.

Furthermore, the Group has set itself the goal of further disseminating knowledge of environmental
issues via the implementation of initiatives aimed at raising internal personnel's awareness of waste
reduction and of waste arising from the use of single-use plastic.

During the course of 2019, HSD S.p.A. initiated the process for certification of its Environmental
Management System to ISO 14001:2015 standards.

Personnel related issues

The Group has already developed various initiatives aimed at investment in its human capital, with
particular reference to corporate welfare and diversity and social inclusion.

Biesse S.p.A. has implemented a process for the formalisation and certification of the workplace
safety management system to ISO 45001 standards. This decision was taken partially based on
feedback from stakeholders, who deemed occupational health and safety to be the most predominant
of the material issues addressed during the course of stakeholder engagement activities.

Human rights, supply chain and social issues

The Group plans to further develop the analysis of risks pertinent to human rights along the value
chain, in line with industry best practice and the relevant international framework. Biesse Group is
attentive to the development of social responsibility initiatives in the localities in which it operates.

Fight against active and passive corruption

In order to further strengthen the safeguards in place for issues concerning the fight against active
and passive corruption, the Group has enhanced the crime risk control plan pursuant to Legislative
Decree 231/01 by planning periodic audit cycles involving the performance of specific control tests.
