Materials used and waste management

Greater efficiency of use of materials in production processes translates to a reduction in costs, waste
and scrap, all of which benefits the environment. For these reasons, the Group promotes the
responsible management of materials and waste, with particular attention to the processing and
disposal of hazardous waste.

The maintenance, safety and environment office is responsible for ensuring compliance with current
legislation concerning the management of the storage, transport and disposal of hazardous and non-
hazardous waste.

With a view to continuous improvement and efficiency gains in production systems, Biesse Group has
almost entirely eliminated the disposal of materials at rubbish dumps, through recovery and recycling,
as well as by means of the rationalisation of raw materials used. In particular, as regards wood panels
used for machinery testing, in order to reduce the quantity that needs to be disposed of, a policy has
been implemented, at the Group's main units, for the intelligent and responsible reuse of materials.
Moreover, Biesse undertakes, as much as possible, to use ecological, recyclable packaging for the
shipment of spare parts, by passing from solutions such as expanded foam and plastic adhesive tape
to filler cardboard and paper adhesive tape.

During the course of 2019, Biesse Group produced over 2,700 tonnes of waste, of which approximately
92% consisted of non-hazardous waste.

35 A new calculation methodology was adopted in 2018 for amounts relating to waste produced by Biesse Group's foreign
non-manufacturing subsidiaries that have been estimated based on prior year average waste figures for the most
representative subsidiaries and on employee numbers. By adopting this methodology, approximately 11% of total waste
produced is based on estimates.
