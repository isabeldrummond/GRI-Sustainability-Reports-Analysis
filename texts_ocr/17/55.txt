white collar staff in Italy and abroad. The process involved extensive training and support to
management with the aim of increasing transparency and of disseminating a feedback culture
throughout the Group. The consolidation of the performance evaluation process fulfils certain
objectives, such as the enhancement of Group management's leadership style and the
implementation of processes that are deemed by younger employees to be essential for their
participation in the current working environment. The adoption of a performance management
process facilitates the retention of highly skilled colleagues, who are increasingly motivated by
challenging and growth-oriented work environments.

Due to the fact that the Group has grown to a significant size in terms of number of subsidiaries and
employees around the world, it is essential to be able to manage the HR processes in an organic
manner, via the use of effective tools. For this reason, a dedicated management system has been
introduced to integrate and standardise at Group level the human resource management and
development processes, including the administration of data relating to personnel and the selection,
training and evaluation processes.

Occupational health and safety

The health and safety of employees are fundamental conditions that merit special attention via
prevention, technological development, training and continuous monitoring. All business activities are
carried out in line with occupational health and safety regulations in force, as well as with the
requirements of the Code of Conduct and the Safety Policy. Moreover, the Group, guarantees the
highest safety standards to operators through organisational and operational measures, but also
through technical measures, the continuous alignment with new technologies, individual protection
devices and the development of training courses.

With reference to the Group's Italian companies, the safety management system requires certain roles
to be filled, in line with relevant regulations. To this effect, for each production unit, persons within or
outwith the Group have been appointed to the position of health and safety manager and to act as
health and safety officers, within the parameters of the law. To guarantee adequate employee
representation within the safety management system, employees are asked to elect their employee
safety representatives.

As evidence of the sensitivity of Biesse Group personnel to issues concerning safety at work, note
that, in 2019, 36 near misses were reported. The issues reported were reviewed to determine the cause
thereof and to improve the prevention system in place.

With respect to certification processes, Biesse S.p.A. has implemented a process for the certification
of the occupational health and safety management system to ISO 45001:2018 standards, with the
aim of creating a culture of health and safety capable of producing continuous improvement of the
company's performance.

During the course of 2019, HSD S.p.A., which had already been awarded occupational health and
safety management system certification to BS OHSAS 18001 standards, initiated and completed
migration to ISO 45001:2018. Renewal of the certification is subject to the execution of specific
periodic audits, aimed at verifying compliance over time with the management system implemented.

In 2019, 91 injuries were recorded, of which 70 occurred in the workplace and 21 occurred while
commuting, a slight decrease compared to 2018. It should also be noted that no work-related fatalities
were recorded. Further information concerning key figures relating to health and safety are indicated
below.
