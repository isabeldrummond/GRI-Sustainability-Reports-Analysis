the number of accident reports in Italy has remained largely unchanged with respect to the same prior
year period, including cases with a fatal outcome’?

The SDGs, and especially SDG 13 “Climate Action”, are intertwined with the Paris Agreement, which
was signed by 195 countries during the course of the conference of that name held in December 2015.
The objective of the Paris Agreement was to limit increases in average global temperature to a
maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to ensure efforts were made to limit the increase to
a maximum of 1.5°C, in order to significantly reduce the risks and impact arising from climate
change".

 

Thanks, in part, to the Paris Agreement, in recent years increasing attention has been paid to issues
concerning climate change. Risks associated with this topic are acknowledged to be increasingly
significant and their proper management and mitigation are fundamental for business continuity.
Under these circumstances, financial institutions have shown an interest in providing funds to entities
that demonstrate they are fully aware of these risks and that they are clearly committed to taking
advantage of the related opportunities.

In May 2019, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere had reached 415 parts per million (ppm), an
increase of 152% on pre-industrial levels'*. As pointed out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), in order to limit the increase in global warming to a maximum of 1.5 °C above pre-
industrial levels, by 2030, it will be necessary to reduce global emissions of CO2 to 45% of levels
recorded in 2010 and to then achieve zero net emissions by 2050'°. The public's attention has been
drawn to multiple extreme climatic events; furthermore, movements worldwide have more vigorous
in their demands for renewed attention to the fight against climate change.

In line with this frame of reference, in 2019, the European Commission launched the European Green
Deal to make Europe the first continent in the world with a zero climatic impact by 2050, thus giving a
boost to the economy, improving people's health and quality of life and protecting nature, without
anyone being excluded from the process. It has been estimated that additional annual investment will
be needed of approximately € 260 billion to achieve the climate and energy related objectives by 2030.

Regarding the economy, we are witnessing a phase of near stagnation, with growth in global GDP
having averaged in the region of 2%"4 since 2010. Economic growth and progress can only occur with
appropriate expenditure on research and development: For OECD member countries, average
expenditure on research and development is in the region of 2.5% of GDP".

Under these circumstances, the private sector has become a sustainability protagonist at local,
national and international level and is increasingly more aware of the need to reconcile the
achievement of corporate objectives to those of its stakeholders, including shareholders, customers,
employees, suppliers and local communities’. Recent developments in legislation related to non-
financial reporting represents a further opportunity to critically examine the economic, social and
environmental performance of enterprises and their contribution to sustainable development.
