to precise measurement of the main values and features of the assembled components. For this
reason, all the mechanical and electrical instruments used are subjected to rigorous quality controls,
conducted by using approximately 9,000 measuring instruments, which are periodically checked and
calibrated by accredited laboratories. The Group also has 15 three-dimensional measuring machines
to check strategic components, plus various laser trackers and interferometers that are used during
testing that have resulted in an increase in measurement accuracy, a reduction in testing times and
the possibility to increase the variables measured.

As regards the improvement in the reliability of the manufacturing sites in India (Bangalore) and China
(Dongguan), the testing systems for electrical assemblies have been standardised in line with those
currently used by the parent company and have thus been automated. During the course of 2019, a
new position of Quality Assurance Tester was also introduced with a mission of continuous
improvement of testing systems.

In order to raise its quality standards, Biesse also looks at models associated with other technological
sectors. The Quality Manager and other staff involved in any manner in quality management have
received training on the IATF 16949:2016 standard (Quality management system requirements for the
mass production of automotive spare parts), thus referring to the automotive sector to expand their
skills and identify new methods to improve the quality of products and supplies.

Product reliability

The Group believes the reliability of machinery to be an essential factor for customer and stakeholder
satisfaction and strives for constant improvement via a proactive organised system.

 

The commitment to experimental development and the pursuit of new machinery and technologies is
always considered to be a priority factor. For the Group, reliability is linked to the strengthening of the
entire production process; the development process for a new product is standardised and formalised
via specific procedures and operational instructions, which detail all the stages thereof.

Customer centrality and satisfaction form the basis of a strategic approach implemented through the
organisation of and control over the supply chain. The quality department analyses reports related to
the replacement of components under warranty and the technical interventions made by the Service
function's technicians.

Meetings on reliability issues are held periodically within each production unit and are attended by all
the business functions involved; quality meetings are also organised by the head of Quality
Management and involve heads of division, factory managers, function managers and general
management to share and discuss the Group's key quality indicators.

In recent years, aknowledge management reliability system has been introduced, being a database of
reliability issues made available to technical departments to prevent the recurrence of issues common
to the various production units already at the product development stage.

Technology at the service of customers and their safety

With the objective of guaranteeing its customers the highest machinery safety standards, the Group
subjects all models produced to stringent risk analysis at the design phase, with particular attention
to risks linked to potential mechanical and electrical factors, as is also the case for operatorsâ€™
behaviour in order to guarantee performance levels that exceed those required by the Machinery
Directive 2006/42/EC and other international, Community and national legislation and regulations. In
the testing phase, tests are performed of the level of noise emitted during operation and of
electromagnetic compatibility with particular reference to radiation emitted and the immunity of
