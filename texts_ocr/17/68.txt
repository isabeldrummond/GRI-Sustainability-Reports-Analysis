Energy consumption and emissions

Energy management

The Group's focus on efficient management of energy consumption has led Biesse to address the
reduction of direct and indirect emissions and to achieve savings in economic terms; to this end,
Biesse S.p.A. has voluntarily appointed an Energy Manager, who is a qualified energy management
expert. In compliance with Legislative Decree 102/2014 (that transposes EU Directive 27/2012
concerning energy efficiency), due to the fact that Biesse S.p.A. is a “Large Enterprise”, energy audits
are conducted every three years on Biesse S.p.A.'s main manufacturing plants. In 2019, the results of
the energy audits for the three year period 2015/2018 were presented. The audits were conducted at
the Pesaro campus and at Intermac's plants, making it possible to identify the real trend in energy
consumption at the audited sites and areas of potential efficiency gains, such as continuous
monitoring of significant energy consumption, upgrading the energy system and improvement of the
environmental impact in the choice of energy sources.

Virtuous conduct is encouraged throughout the Group with a view to the reduction of employees’ daily
energy consumption in the performance of their work; furthermore, investments are constantly made
in waste reduction devices, for example, for periods of inactivity (nights, weekends and holidays), and
in highly efficient energy systems, which may even involve the replacement of old, less efficient
systems.

Electricity used by the Group is mainly for the supply of power for manufacturing cycles in
manufacturing plants and, to a lesser extent, for offices and services. Total electricity consumed in
2019 corresponds to approximately 66,464 GJ, a decrease of approximately 4% compared to the 2018
figure.

The methods adopted by the Group to reduce energy consumption are constantly evolving and consist

of a mix of activities ranging from awareness and adoption of responsible behaviour of personnel to
investments in new tools and technologies.

Via the photovoltaic plants installed on the Pesaro campus with a total surface area of approximately
12,000 m? and with an installed capacity of 770 kW, approximately 1,011 MWh of clean energy was
generated in the year, of which approximately 80% was used by the Group for its activities.

During the course of 2019, a new photovoltaic plant was installed within the Pesaro campus that will
be brought into use in 2020. It covers a surface area of approximately 4,500 m? and has a nominal
capacity of approximately 495 kWp. When the plant becomes fully operational, it is expected to
generate approximately 575 MWh of power, of which approximately 85% will be used for internal
activities.

28 GJ conversion factors used in 2019 are based on 2019 UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company
Reporting.
