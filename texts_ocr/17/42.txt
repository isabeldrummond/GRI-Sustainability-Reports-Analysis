ZBIESSEGROUP

The Group at the service of its customers

Customer centrality and satisfaction form the basis of a strategic approach that starts with the
sustainable management of the supply chain and continues throughout all stages of the lifespan of
the product, by means of advanced industrial consulting, support and maintenance services.

With over 500 Field Engineers and approximately 100 Hotliners in direct contact with its global
network, the Group is capable of offering support and technical training services and spare parts for
machinery and components on-site and on-line. During the course of 2019, two new positions were
introduced to the Group's service function, namely, Customer Care Manager and Service Area
Manager, whose duties are to manage customer relationships and the productivity of supplies
subsequent to the installation of machinery. Furthermore, surveys of customers and dealers were
undertaken with the objective of obtaining a large number of opinions to help identify areas of
improvement for services offered by the Group.

In the belief that the provision of training and professional development programmes is essential for
the improvement of service quality, the localisation of skills and the development of technical /
managerial staff of the highest quality, a Service Academy has been set up to act as a training and
support centre for the Group's entire service network. In 2019, the Service Academy was enhanced
through the introduction of advanced courses on the entire portfolio of machinery produced by Biesse
and through the organisation of troubleshooting courses designed for the Group's technicians and
customers, in order to increase their diagnostic skills.

The “Parts” spare parts web portal enables customers to navigate within their personal account, to
access all the information related to purchases made, to directly submit an order for spare parts by
placing them in an order basket and to monitor the status thereof. The portal is available 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week. Parts is a multilingual and multi-platform tool, which is perfectly integrated with
the main operating systems, iOS and Android, and runs on desktops, smartphones or tablets, via
dedicated apps.

Quality Management System

With the objective of offering high quality standards to its customers, in 1996, Biesse S.p.A. adopted
a Quality Management System certified to the ISO 9001 international standard. As at 31 December
2019, the certification had involved 10 of the Group's manufacturing sites in Italy, India and China.

The Group's main processes and activities are formalised in a series of first level documents, such as
process and procedure flows, as prepared by the Group's Quality Department. These are backed by
operational instructions that set out in detail the Group's most significant activities. To guarantee the
standardisation of the processes, most of the Quality System documents are available (in Italian,
English and Chinese) and may be accessed by all Group companies via the corporate intranet.

In 2019, all the Group's manufacturing units that had already been certified passed the audit of
compliance with the ISO 9001:2015 standard.

Moreover, as regards Biesse Manufacturing India's manufacturing site, the scope of ISO 9001:2015
certification has been extended to include the machinery installation and support process.

Compliance with the ISO 9001:2015 standard is assured through periodic internal audits that involve
the processes of all manufacturing units.

Prior to being delivered to the customer, all machinery must pass testing required by regulations in
force, as well as specific tests depending on product type. The quality of Biesse's products is subject
