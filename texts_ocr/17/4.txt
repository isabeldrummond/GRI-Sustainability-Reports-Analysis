Methodological note

This document constitutes the 2019 consolidated non-financial statement (hereinafter “NFS” or
“Statement’), pursuant to Legislative Decree 254/2016 (implementing Directive 2014/95/EU), of the
companies pertaining to the Group consisting of Biesse S.p.A. and its fully consolidated subsidiaries

as required by Art. 3 of the Decree.

The NFS has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (2016)
published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), in accordance with the Core option and in line with
the corporate procedure for the preparation of the NFS. The GRI Content Index has been included as
an attachment to the document and describes the content that has been addressed in compliance
with the GRI Standards. The content addressed by the NFS has been selected based on the results of
a materiality analysis, as updated in 2019, that has enabled us to identify topics that are material to
the Group and its stakeholders. The materiality matrix resulting from the analysis conducted was
approved by the Control and Risks Committee on 30 October 2019 and has been presented in the
section of this document headed “Stakeholders and materiality analysis”. It should be noted that, on
account of the business sector, there have been no significant pollutant atmospheric emissions other
than greenhouse gas emissions.

The scope of the 2019 economic, social and environmental data and information is the same as that
of Biesse Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. Any
changes in the scope have been appropriately indicated in the document. It should also be noted that
there have been no significant changes in 2019 in the Group's size, organisational structure, ownership
or supply chain. With regard thereto, the sole change was the liquidation of Biesse Tecno System S.r.I.
on 27 December 2018: this has not had any significant impact on the NFS for the year ended 31
December 2019.

To enable the comparability of data over time and to evaluate the Group's performance, where
possible, prior year comparatives have been provided. Any restatement of previously published
comparative amounts has been clearly stated as such.

Moreover, for the purpose of the correct presentation of performance and to ensure the reliability of
the data, the use of estimates has been limited as much as possible and, if used, have been based on
the best available methodologies and have been appropriately disclosed.
