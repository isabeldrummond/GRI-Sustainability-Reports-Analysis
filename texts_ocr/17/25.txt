Biesse Group's approach

Based on an analysis of the 17 SDGs and of Community and national legislation related to non-
financial reporting, the Group has identified the following reference macro areas on which to base its
approach to sustainability, as part of an ethical and sustainable business management strategy:
Economic sustainability, Social sustainability and Environmental sustainability. Specifically, the path of
sustainability embarked upon by the Group aims to gradually gain a strategic understanding of
sustainability in these macro areas, in order to identify the actions needed and to expand and extend
the positive externalities of its work by implementing innovative solutions to control and mitigate the
negative externalities.

All activities carried out by the Group are performed in recognition of the moral and social
responsibilities that the Company has towards its stakeholders, in the belief that the achievement of
commercial objectives must be accompanied not only by compliance with specific corporate values,
but also with regulations in force and general duties of honesty, integrity, fair competition, correctness
and good faith. Business ethics and integrity are central to the Group's daily activities and its medium
to long term sustainability strategy. As indicated in the previous chapter, the adoption of the Code of
Conduct and of the Anti-corruption Code of Conduct, combined with the numerous other policies,
codes and regulations aimed at guaranteeing compliance with business ethics and integrity, reflect
the Group's commitment to absolute correctness and maximum transparency in the conduct of its
business activities and of its relationships with stakeholders.

During the course of 2019, the Group adopted a Sustainability Policy inspired by Agenda 2030 setting
out the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), by the Paris Agreement (COP21 - Conference of the
Parties to the UNFCCC) and by the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact and by taking account of
Community (European Directive No. 95/2014) and national (Legislative Decree 254/2016) legislation
concerning non-financial reporting, as well as the principles, values and rules contained in the Group's
Code of Conduct and in the other corporate regulations and policies designed to ensure business
