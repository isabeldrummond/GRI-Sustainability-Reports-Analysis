Letter to stakeholders

Dear stakeholders,

We are pleased to present to you Biesse Group's third consolidated non-financial statement. By
reading the document, you will have a chance to gain an understanding of and to analyse the key
results achieved and the future scenarios associated with the Group's economic, social and
environmental sustainability.

For us, this third edition of the document is a fundamentally important step along the path to a
strategic understanding of the impact thereof on all the stakeholders, such as employees, customers,
suppliers, shareholders and local communities.

Globally, a new business and production model is increasing becoming popular that, together with
economic growth, recognises the need to combine social development and environmental
sustainability, leading to the creation of a new entrepreneurial paradigm.

This path motivates us to encourage strategic shared value decisions aligned with corporate
governance that clearly spell out the values associated with our brand.

Customer satisfaction has always been a driver of our commercial strategy and of significant
investment in research and development. We are committed to designing and manufacturing
technologically advanced machines and systems that facilitate our customersâ€™ industrial development
process, enabling them to become active protagonists of the fourth industrial revolution.

We are convinced that a business's performance is dependent on attention paid to workers and their
wellbeing. We firmly believe in the importance of the development of professional skills and of
rewarding individual and collective merit in order to redistribute part of the value created to our people.
We are also convinced that creativity and sustainable innovation are, by definition, characteristics that
are typical of young people and we are particularly proud to have welcomed to the Group more than
500 under 35 year olds over the last three years.

We encourage a responsible approach to the use of natural resources by preventing waste and by
implementing initiatives aimed at greater efficiency in energy consumption. Being aware of global
challenges and targets set also at European level based on the Agenda 2030, we have decided to
actively contribute to tackling climate change, by purchasing electricity produced from renewable
energy sources so as to significantly reduce Biesse Group's indirect emissions of COz, effective 2020.

We believe that the Group can and should actively dialogue with the locality and the community and
become a point of reference within the environments in which it operates. With this in mind, we
constantly collaborate with trade associations, universities, research centres, trade fair organisers and
other parties, which, along with us, actively contribute to the creation of sustainable, widespread value.

This approach, which drives our corporate strategies, increasingly identifies itself with research,
innovation and the redistribution of value, which is a key factor for our business, allowing us to be
aligned with current global economic and financial policies that will enable us to achieve so-called
sustainable success.

At the time of publishing of the present document, national and international scenarios are strongly
influenced by the restrictions related to the Corona Virus disease spread. Such scenario will
necessarily lead to direct and indirect consequences to the corporate business as well as to the
internal and external environment in which our company operates.

Anyway, thanks to our vision, organization, management and financial strength, we are ready to deal
with the acute phase of this period. In this framework, sure to be an integral and active part of the
