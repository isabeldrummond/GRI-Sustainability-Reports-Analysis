Stakeholders and materiality analysis

Stakeholders

There are numerous persons, customers, partners, organisations and entities that contribute directly
or indirectly to the success of the Group and that, due to the role they play, are capable of influencing
performance and decisions. As part of the path of sustainability embarked upon, Biesse Group has
prepared a mapping of its main stakeholders, driven by the desire to increasingly encourage
communication, dialogue and constant attention to relationships based on values of transparency and
integrity. The engagement of internal and external stakeholders is an essential element of the Group's
sustainability strategy. Thanks to a process of constant listening and discussion, the Group is more
aware of the extent to which it is meeting the expectations and interests of its stakeholders and is
able to identify the areas for which it needs to strengthen its commitment and those for which the
adopted approach may be confirmed. The following figure provides a brief overview of the Group's
main stakeholders:
