employee to make best use of this communication tool and to make contact, in a responsible manner,
with Biesse Group's and the divisions’ social media.

The Group issues press releases of a financial and institutional/commercial nature.

Press releases of a financial nature are mainly targeted at investors and shareholders, and are handled
and prepared by the Group's Investor Relations Officer, who is responsible, together with the
Communication and Legal Affairs functions and with General Management, for their content and
dissemination through the apposite channels. The financial press releases deemed to be of more
value to stakeholders, containing financial data or statements on the Group's performance, are also
published on the corporate intranet, in the press review and on the divisional websites.

Institutional and commercial press releases, which are prepared by the Communications department,
contain information about Group initiatives and are sent to industry sector and non-industry sector
journalists, are published on the divisional websites, within the magazine section and are posted on
social channels. Press releases of an institutional and commercial nature are used to promote Group
initiatives, such as the receipt of an award or a recognition, whereas commercial press releases deal
with issues such as attendance at trade fairs and events, the opening of new campuses around the
world and the strengths of technological solutions offered.

It should also be noted that no cases arose in 2019 of non-compliance with voluntary regulations and
codes concerning communications and marketing.

 

 

Aimed at all stakeholders, Make is a publication conceived as a new means of discovering Biesse
Group, the thoughts of those who lead it, the technological innovation that makes it stand out, the
testimonies of those who chose it to grow, the events that animate it and the tales of those who work
there every day. This tool, in both its print and online versions, has the objective of divulging useful
information to all stakeholders and of offering a transparent relationship and a constantly updated
vision of what is happening in the business.

 

The integration of digital and social media into communication strategies completes the Group's
commitment to be increasingly attentive to the communication of business activities to its
stakeholders in order to engage with them more.

corporate Twitter channel and three divisional channels, a corporate Instagram account and three
divisional accounts, a corporate LinkedIn profile, which is used as a talent attraction and recruiting
tool, a divisional LinkedIn page on business tooling and a YouTube channel.
