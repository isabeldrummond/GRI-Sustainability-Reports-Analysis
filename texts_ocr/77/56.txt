Atmospheric emissions

 

In 2016, the Group produced a total of 16,640 tonnes of CO."°, with a decrease of about 12% with respect to 2015.
These carbon dioxide emissions can be broken down as follows:

Scope 1 - Direct emissions associated with proprietary sources or under the control of the companies in the Group,
such as fuels used for heating and for the work vehicles necessary for the Group’s activities.

Scope 2 - Indirect emissions associated with the generation of energy purchased and subsequently consumed at
the Group’s plants.

In 2016, the direct CO, emissions (Scope 71 emissions) were 8,175 tonnes, recording a decrease of over 15%'° with
respect to the previous year. The indirect CO2 emissions (Scope 2 emissions) amounted to 8,465 tonnes, again with
a reduction compared to 2015, albeit lower, equivalent to about 8%.

m Scope 1 The GRI Sustainability Reporting
mScope2 Standards establish two methods for

10.500 . ci
calculating the Scope 2 emissions:

9.649 9.216

9.500 8.175 8.465 “Location-based” and “Market-based”.
7.500 The “Location-based” method, used
6.000 to calculate the emissions indicated
4.500 above, reflects the average intensity
3,000 of the emissions produced by the total
4.500 national electricity production, while the

5 “Market-based” method reflects the

2016 2015 emissions produced by the electricity

that the companies have chosen to use

and can be calculated using the default emission factors that represent the "residual mix", that is the unmonitored

and unclaimed energy and emissions (approach adopted for Italy'”), and regional, subnational or national average
emission factors (approach adopted for India).
