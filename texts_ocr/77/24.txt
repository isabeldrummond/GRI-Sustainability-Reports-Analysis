Internal Audit

As part of its continuous improvements to the internal control and risk management system, Isagro S.p.A. has
established the Internal Audit Department. This department, which reports directly to the Board of Directors, verifies
the operations and suitability of the internal control and risk management system through an annual audit plan
based on a structured process of analysis and prioritisation of the main risks.

In addition, it prepares periodic reports containing information on its own activities, the methods used for risk
management and on compliance with the risk mitigation plans. The periodic reports contain a suitability assessment
of the internal control and risk management system.

Isagro against corruption

Isagro S.p.A. focuses in particular on the issue of corruption, promoting the fight against all of its forms. Through
the Code of Ethics and the Organisation, Management and Control Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree
231/2001, management is committed to providing clear directives in order to effectively prevent all forms of
corruption.

In particular, the 231 Model refers to the punishment for Corporate Offences, which include corruption between
private individuals. The Code of Ethics also confirms that no form of corruption is tolerated in relations with
suppliers and with Public Administration. With explicit reference to Public Administration officials, the parent
company specifies that no money, gift or any other payment in kind may be offered which could be interpreted as
an attempt to influence the way they carry out their duties.

In 2016 there was no record of reports or disciplinary measures relating to corruption being received, either by
Isagro S.p.A. or at Group level. Isagro S.p.A. actively participates in preventing corruption, also through specific
training courses to disseminate awareness and application of the system. The courses are regularly held through an
online platform, every time the Organisation, Management and Control Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree
231/2001 is updated, as occurred in 2017.

The Isagro Group and respect for human rights

In conducting its business activities, Isagro is committed to ensuring that the working conditions of its employees
are based on respect for fundamental human rights, the international agreements and laws in force; the Group does
not tolerate the use of forced labour, that is, the use of workers recruited by constraint, force or blackmail, under
any circumstances. The Group is constantly committed to creating and maintaining a working environment that
protects everyone’s dignity and respects the fundamental rights of individuals with whom it interacts, safeguarding
their physical and moral integrity and guaranteeing equal opportunities.

In this sense, as expressed in the Ethics Code, the Group rejects all forms of discrimination based on age, gender,
sexual preference, health, race, nationality, cultural background, social status, political opinions and religious
beliefs. The Group guarantees a safe and healthy workplace for its employees and working conditions that respect
individual dignity.
