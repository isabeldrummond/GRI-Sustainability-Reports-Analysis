Pay policies

 

As part of its pay policy plan, the Isagro Group has a differentiated system according to the work category, which
comprises incentive systems linked to individual and company objectives as well as the pay component. Within
the Isagro Group, the pay policies are oriented to guarantee competiveness on the labour market, in line with the
growth objectives, and the loyalty of its human resources, and to differentiate the pay instruments on the basis
of individual skills and responsibilities. In some companies of the Group, such as the Brazilian and Colombian
companies, a performance assessment system is implemented on the basis of environmental and social criteria as
well as the results obtained.

The members of the Board of Directors, in particular, receive a fixed annual salary, the amount of which depends
on the commitment required of them; this amount is higher for directors occupying roles of particular responsibility
or that are also members of committees within the Board. The salaries of executive directors are determined on
the basis of the best practices followed for similar posts by companies present in the same sector in which Isagro
S.p.A. operates and is made up of a fixed annual component, a variable component and fringe benefits such as the
assignment of company cars and a “Directors & Officers” insurance policy. All workers have access to the company
canteen, where present, or receive meal vouchers the value of which varies according to the workplace.

In some cases, such as Isagro’s U.S. site, new recruits are given a bonus determined according to the type of
work that they have been called to perform, while a particularly virtuous case is Isagro Shanghai, which offers its
employees life and health insurance, disability and invalidity cover, a pension plan, unemployment insurance and
a housing allowance.
