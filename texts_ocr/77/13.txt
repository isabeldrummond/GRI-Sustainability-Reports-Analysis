Isagro considers sustainability an integral part of its business strategy, based on a responsible approach that takes

account of the balance between the organization, the areas in which it operates and the local communities.

e The strategy adopted by Isagro has the objective of creating value for the Group’s stakeholders, meeting the
market’s needs and taking advantage of the new opportunities that arise from a correct management of people
and the environment.

¢ To this aim, in 2017, Isagro conducted its first materiality analysis, which involved the main corporate functions,
in order to strengthen its responsible approach by identifying and giving priority to sustainability issues that
are important for the Group and its stakeholders. In particular, Isagro identified the material aspects that
reflect the significant impacts for the organization from the economic, social and environmental points of
view and substantially influence the assessments and the stakeholders’ decisions. In fact, Isagro believes
it to be fundamentally important to establish relationships based on trust, respect and collaboration with its
stakeholders, so as to be able to meet their needs and expectations adequately. In the dynamic and competitive
scenario in which the Group operates, the ability to predict and anticipate changes in interest or needs is an
indispensable condition for creating value.
