The most important issues regard both specific aspects of the sector in which the Group operates, primarily
the quality and safety of its products and research and development, associated with the Group’s desire to
put increasingly innovative, high-performance products with high levels of safety and quality on the market, and
aspects associated with governance and compliance, primarily ethics, business integrity, anticorruption and
compliance.

In the environmental sector, priority is given to issues such as waste management, atmospheric emissions and
climate change mitigation. Particular importance is also given to the social issue, people management and
development, in relation to the Group’s commitment to favour policies elaborated with a view to valorizing and
facilitating the growth of its employees, and its implementation of a system that ensures equal rights. The matrix
also reveals the importance given to the social issue of human rights, a sign of the Group’s strong commitment
and the requests of its stakeholders to ensure that the applicable national and international legislation is respected,

condemning all forms of labour exploitation, forced labour and child labour at the same time.
Further details on the analysis of material issues are given in the Annexes of this document.
