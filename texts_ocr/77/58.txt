 

The large quantity of hazardous waste that characterizes Isagro’s business entails a need for attention towards
responsible waste management in strict compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. The Group continues
its awareness projects aimed at favouring the disposal, recovery and recycling of the materials used in the industrial

processes.

In 2016, the waste produced amounted to 2,462 tonnes, a slight decrease compared to the previous year (-5%). As

can be seen from the chart below, a significant proportion of this waste, i.e. 2,183 tonnes, equivalent to about 89%

of the total, is represented by hazardous waste, in line with the previous year. Non-hazardous waste represents a

residual part.

In line with our environmental policy that includes careful management of the material put into and taken out of the
company’s manufacturing process, most of the waste produced is disposed of at a landfill site (76% in 2016). The
remaining amounts are transferred for recovery (12% in 2016) or incineration (9% in 2016) while a minimum amount

of waste is used to produce energy and converted into compost.
