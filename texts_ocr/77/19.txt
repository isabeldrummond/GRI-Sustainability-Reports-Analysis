Corporate Governance

 

The Group is aware of the importance of the role played by an effective and efficient Corporate Governance system
in achieving business objectives and creating sustainable long-term value. The Corporate Governance system is
represented by the set of principles, rules and procedures that govern the decision-making process and guide
the business activities, in addition to guaranteeing efficient and transparent control and monitoring. The Isagro
Corporate Governance model complies with current regulations and is in line with provisions of the Corporate
Governance Code approved by Borsa Italiana S.p.A.’s Committee for Corporate Governance Committee of listed
companies (the “Corporate Governance Code”), applied by the company since 2003.

The model adopted by Isagro envisages the following corporate bodies: the Shareholders’ Meeting, the Board of
Directors (BoD), the Board of Statutory Auditors and internal Board of Directors committees, such as the Control
and Risk Committee and the Appointments and Remuneration Committee.

The Shareholders' Meeting of 24 April 2015, decided that the Board of Directors should have eight members,
including three women, three aged between 30 and 50 and five over 50 years of age. The Board of Directors will
remain in office until the Shareholders' Meeting held to approve the financial statements for the year ending 31
December 2017. The Board of Statutory Auditors, in office since 28 April 2016, has five members and will remain in
office until the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ending 31 December
2018.

The membership of the Board of Directors as at 31 December 2016 is shown in the following table.
