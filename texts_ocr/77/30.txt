The plant has an excellent environmental performance, using technologies
and resource management systems that enable particularly low levels of
environmental impact to be reached. In addition to this, an energy diagnosis
study has been conducted with a view to optimizing the use of electrical and
thermal resources. In 2015, odour abatement components were installed
on the system and a systematic and specific staff training programme
was implemented in order to reduce the risks present in the surrounding
environment.

The Bussi sul Tirino plant synthesizes the active ingredient of Tetraconazole,
starting from what is produced at the Indian plant in Panoli. In 2015, the
plant received a major investment for the construction of a cryogenic
condensation plant that enabled the emission of volatile organic compounds
to be reduced significantly and the raw material to be reused.

The Novara plant, called Biological Product Unit, produces formulations
based on natural microorganisms. In operation since 2006 and almost
entirely free of significant gaseous emissions, the plant can serve both the
agricultural market and the environmental market. Since 2015, the plant has
been integrated in the New Research Center area, whose mission is to
identify new active ingredients, to develop products in order to have them
registered for commercial purposes and to defend the products registered
to maintain their commercial utility.
