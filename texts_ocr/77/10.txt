Customers

The distribution of Agropharmaceuticals and nutritional products, especially on markets with a fragmented demand,

requires sales structures with high fixed costs and significant amounts of circulating capital. For this reason, Isagro,

who does not have a broad catalogue of proprietary products but works on selected molecules that are the fruit of

its discovery activities, would not be able to operate efficiently with directly controlled distribution structures on all

the markets on which it sells its products.

Consequently, the Group distributes its products:

¢ directly with its own local structures, where this is economically and financially feasible/profitable, in other
words, markets for which the Isagro products, together with opportunistically co-distributed third-party
products, justify the fixed-cost structure of the single networks and/or where it is considered to be strategic;

e indirectly through third-party distributors on the other markets. These distributors, as indicated previously, may
be local independent companies or branches/subsidiaries of international groups.

Isagro also pursues the strategy of developing local offices on strategic markets through which to coordinate the

local registration activities, hold the registrations and perform marketing operations in support of the sales of third-

party distributors.

The types of customers include distributors on a national level, agricultural cooperatives, farming consortia,

wholesalers and farmers.

Distribution through the distribution networks of third parties

With regard to the distribution of proprietary products via the networks of third parties, the marketing strategy varies
according to the type of product. In fact, most agropharmaceutical products owned by the Group are marketed
through Partners, distributors belonging to multinational groups and distributors not belonging to multinational
groups (or independent distributors). Non-partner distributors are chosen on the basis of the efficiency of the sales
organization, the coverage of the area and the presence of a complementary product portfolio with respect to the
Group’s proprietary products.

Partner distributors

The Partners handle the exclusive or non-exclusive distribution of the Group’s products in countries in which they
are present with their own direct sales organizations, receiving both technical products (i.e. active pharmaceutical
ingredients) to be formulated subsequently and packaged locally, and unpackaged formulations to be packaged
locally.

Distributors belonging to multinational groups

Distributors belonging to multinational groups represent an important marketing channel above all for the lines of
copper-based products and pyrethroids, in that they guarantee high market shares and therefore greater sales
volumes due to their efficient distribution networks and a complete product portfolio.

Distributors not belonging to multinational groups (or independent distributors)

These distributors, chosen on the basis of the efficiency of their sales organization, the coverage of the area and
the presence of a product portfolio complementary to the Group’s products, receive from the Group both finished
products and unpackaged formulations to be packaged locally, according to the suitability and availability of local

structures.
