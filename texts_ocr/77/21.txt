nce context

 

Since 2016, Isagro has developed a new approach to sustainability, and the decision to commit to the annual
preparation of a non-financial report forms part of a vastly important national and international context in which
environmental protection, the adoption of sustainable development and management of resources play a central
role. The Group has always been careful of the environmental impact caused by its business activities, so much
so that for several years it has been committed to preparing a specific Environmental Report, but recent regulatory
developments have also increased awareness of other impacts, such as_ social, governance and supply chain-
related aspects.

The international framework covering the Isagro Non-Financial Report includes, in particular, the Sustainable
Development Goals (17 goals set for 2030 by the United Nations, involving the public and private sectors in
promoting the achievement of common goals such as peace, safety, justice, social inclusion and environmental
responsibility) and Italian Law Decree no. 256 which transposes European Directive 2014/95 to Italian law - Barnier
on “Non-financial disclosure”, which envisages the obligation for certain public interest companies to issue a
disclosure from 2017 on the management of social and environmental issues.

Isagro operates in a complex and highly technological market and considers good management and control over
the risks to which it is exposed to be a determining factor in guaranteeing stability and balance over time and in
maintaining long-lasting relationships with its Stakeholders. To this aim, the Group has adopted a specific “Internal
Control and Risk Management System” to identify and assess action and events that are able to jeopardise Group
operations.
