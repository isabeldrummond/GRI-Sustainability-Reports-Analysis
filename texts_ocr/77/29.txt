in India.

Adria

The Adria plant occupies an area of about 73,000 m2, of which almost half is
green; the plant is dedicated to the production of copper based fungicides.
The Adria plant has ISO 14001 certification; in addition, the plant obtained
EMAS registration in 2009 and, once a year, produces a public environmental
declaration that can be downloaded from the Sustainability section of the
web site www.isagro.com. The Adria plant regularly sets environmental
performance and environmental staff training targets in order to improve its
performance. The plant constantly monitors its environmental parameters,
which are well below the limit threshold laid down in the legislation in force.

Aprilia

The Aprilia plant, which occupies an area of 133,500 m2, is used
