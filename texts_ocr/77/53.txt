ment of environmental impacts

 

Environmental protection is a commitment for Isagro and is reflected by behaviour and activities managed in an
efficient and economical way, to guarantee maximum safety and quality of the production processes with full respect
for the environment and the area in which it operates. Like every production activity, the Group’s plants take resources
from nature.

Aware of the fact that, to ensure a balance, natural resources must remain at the disposal of future generations, Isagro
has implemented an environmental impact control policy so as to make a true investment in industrial development.
Anticipating the indications given and agreed upon in the National Collective Agreement for the chemistry sector,
Isagro has adopted environmental issue involvement and communication strategies towards all its stakeholders. The
activities agreed upon with the trade unions, already carried out by the Group on the basis of its environmental policy,
are:

e¢ membership of the Responsible Care programme;

¢ important training on Health, Safety and the Environment;

e involvement of workers’ safety representatives in all the company’s activities;

¢ involvement of contractors in the practices selected by Isagro for safeguarding the environment.

The “Responsible Care” programme is a voluntary programme with the objective of guiding its
member companies towards a sustainable development model of the world chemical industry, through -
guidelines, performance indicators and the checking and monitoring of the performance obtained. By :
joining the programme, the companies can monitor and improve their health, safety and environmental
performance.

Currently adopted by over 10,000 organizations in more than 60 countries, it is managed in Italy by:
Federchimica, with over 150 member companies. The results of the activities of the programme are :
published annually in a report. ‘

These commitments result in an increased awareness and preparation of the company’s staff and the surrounding
environment, with a view to encouraging safer behaviour towards the environment on which the possible impacts of
their work activities are to be minimized.

In this sense, the Group has adopted a specific Environmental Management System, the purpose of which is to control
every aspect of the environmental impacts. The obtainment of EMAS registration by the Adria plant guarantees a
higher level of transparency towards the public. In fact, this plant, like the Panoli plant, has obtained ISO 14001
certification, integrating specific environmental procedures in its Quality Management System, present at every plant.
