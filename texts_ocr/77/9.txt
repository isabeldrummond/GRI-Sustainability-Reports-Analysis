Presence on the market

 

The Group has five production plants, four of which are situated in Italy (Adria, Aprilia, Bussi sul Tirino and Novara)
and one in India (Panoli). It also has a Research Center in Novara (originally Montecatini/Montedison, founded in
1956 and subjected to a major renewal in 2015) and a field testing site in Galliera (purchased in 2001 as part of
the takeover of Caffaro). With regard to its approach to the market, due to the fact that it is smaller than its direct
competitors, Isagro adopts a “hybrid” model, operating directly in local marketing/distribution in Brazil (since 2017),
Colombia, India, Spain and the USA through its subsidiaries and indirectly in the other countries through third-party
distributors (independent or belonging to large groups), selling its products in more than 80 countries all over the
world.
