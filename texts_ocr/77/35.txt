rest of the world production, for 30%, is due to the natural vegetative growth and 30% to the contribution of these
products without which the harvest would be lost, thus halving production. In this way, over the past 50 years,
the levels of productivity of the land have more than doubled despite a much smaller increase in the amount of
cultivable land.

As illustrated above, the main objective of using Agropharmaceuticals in modern agriculture is represented by the
need to increase the yield of crops per unit of cultivated surface area, in order to ensure a growth for the production
of food in line with that of the population and the economic conditions. In fact, the availability of land for agricultural
use is, on a worldwide level, a limited resource that is difficult to expand so its productiveness must be increased.
In addition, failure to defend crops could cause a loss of up to 75% of production, according to the crop and the
environmental conditions.

Agropharmaceuticals are used mainly on crops that serve to produce food (for human or animal consumption) -
in particular, fruit and vegetables represent nearly 25% of total sales in that they are high-profit crops per unit of
cultivated land and increase the propensity to purchase Agropharmaceuticals - and, to a lesser degree, for other
goods, such as textile fibres (cotton, linen, jute, etc.), starch and oil for non-food use (cosmetic bases) and biofuels.
As it is a decisive issue for the development of its business, Isagro pays a great deal of attention to the production

and use of Agropharmaceuticals and other technologies aimed at improving the yield of cultivated land.
