In this setting, the Isagro Group has adopted an environmental risk management protocol, divided into the following
phases:

¢ periodic monitoring of the consumption of natural resources (water and energy);

¢ close control of outgoing pollution parameters so as to prevent the emission thresholds set from being exceeded;
¢ ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of the abatement/treatment systems;

¢ research and innovation in abatement systems;

¢ periodic analysis of the production flows aimed at minimizing their environmental impact.

The correct application of the environmental protocol on a Group level is guaranteed by the “Environmental policy” - a
document that indicates the impact reduction targets and the guidelines to be followed to reach them and that every
plant sets and periodically renews — and the adoption of a Management System — including a series of procedures
and operating instructions for controlling all environmental impacts — implemented by each site.

Although the Group’s activity is carried out in compliance with the laws and regulations in force and Isagro has
adopted an environmental management protocol, it cannot be excluded that, in the future, following violations found,
causes of force majeure or changes to the legislation, the Group may be called to bear significant costs or investments
or be subjected to environmental responsibility for the activities carried out, with a risk of negative effects on its

economic, financial and asset situation.
