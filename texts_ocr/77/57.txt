Like all other production plants, Isagro’s plants take the water they need to transform raw materials into finished
products from nature.

The Group’s water consumption in 2016 reached an overall value of 1,209,909 m°, of which more than 70% is
attributable to the Bussi plant alone. The main supply source, accounting for over 95% of the water consumed, is
represented by local watercourses and, to a far lesser extent, by wells (2.4%) and water supply systems (2.1%),
whose consumption is closely linked to the presence of staff on the sites.

On the farm complex at the Galliera site, there is also an Artesian well but the water drawn from it is not monitored.
This well is occasionally used to irrigate the farmland.
