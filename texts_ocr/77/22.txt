The Internal Control and Risk Management System

 

Aware that sound risk management and a good internal control system are crucial to ensuring efficient and effective
corporate process management, Isagro S.p.A. adopted an “Internal Control and Risk Management System” to
identify and assess actions and events that could jeopardise the activities.

The internal control and risk management system involves various bodies and individuals of Isagro S.p.A.:

e the Board of Directors, which has the role of guidance and assessment of the system’s adequacy;

e the Director in charge of the internal control and risk management system, who arranges its planning,
implementation and management. This duty is assigned to the Company’s Chairman and CEO;

e the Risk and Control Committee, with the task of supporting Board of Directors assessments and decisions
relating to the internal control and risk management system;

e the Risk Manager, appointed to assist the corporate bodies in the risk management process;

e the Internal Audit Manager, with the duty of verifying that the internal control and risk management system is
adequate and operational;

e the company departments responsible for controls to ensure the monitoring and management of business risks;

e the Manager charged with preparing the company’s financial reports, who confirms that Company disclosures
to the market correspond with the accounting books and records;

e the Managers of the Corporate Affairs and Legal departments;

e the Board of Statutory Auditors, which supervises the efficiency of the internal control and risk management
system;

e the Supervisory Body, pursuant to art. 6, Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001.

The internal control and risk management system comprises a set of rules, procedures and organisational
structures which, through a suitable identification, measurement, management and monitoring process for the main
risks, allows sound and fair business management consistent with the predefined objectives.

In particular, the risk management process involves risk assessment activity which aims to identify the main
business processes and related risks and to identify and assess the prevention/protection measures implemented
by the Company to limit those risks.

At the same time, the Parent company also has an Organisation, Management and Control Model pursuant
to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001 which describes the organisational model adopted by Isagro S.p.A.
Implemented in 2006 and updated in 2016, the Model aims to prevent and punish any conduct that could be
classified as offences envisaged in the Decree. In its updated version, the model reflects the changes in the
organisation and is aligned to the current reference best practices. This document is designed as a means of
protecting the values already agreed within the company. The model contains the Code of Ethics and refers to
the appointment of a Supervisory Board, which has the duty of supervising the operations of Isagro S.p.A. with
monitoring and updating of the model itself.
