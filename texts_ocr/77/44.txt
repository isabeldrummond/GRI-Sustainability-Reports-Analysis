The Isagro Group confirms its maximum effort to ensure health and safety at the workplace as fundamental
elements and indispensable values for the Group.

In fulfilment of the obligations laid down in the occupational health and safety legislation, Isagro makes investments
that the employers of each production plant consider to be necessary, in each individual case, to guarantee a
safe and responsible management of the production processes and a safe environment for the workers. These
investments are proposed at the beginning of every year, following assessments made by the Health and Safety
Departments in collaboration with the Employers and Technical department managers. If a need arises to make
further investments not included in the budget during the year, they are made in any case, which confirms the top
priority that Isagro gives to Health, Safety and the Environment. To guarantee the efficacy of these investments
and constantly check the adequacy of the objectives set, the Group continually implements specific organizational
models.

In addition, each of the Group’s plants is regulated by a Safety Management System, whose purpose is to make
the work procedures safer and more reliable. In particular, the Adria and Aprilia plants implement specific Safety
Management Systems that fulfil a legal obligation imposed by the fact that the two sites are subject to the “Seveso
directive” (that is, Legislative decree no. 105/2015, which is the Italian transposition of the European directive
known as “Seveso-lll directive”). These systems are designed to prevent accidents on the plant, considered
significant in that they would involve huge quantities of chemicals.

To be more specific, the health and safety activities concerned:

¢ — staff training and awareness activities and training on workplace safety issues;

¢ monitoring of the principal indices for work accidents;

¢ improvements in the conditions of safety, adaptation of the production sites and adoption of the best available
technologies;

¢ regular management of systems, machinery and equipment so as to minimize risks for the employees’ health
and safety;

¢ updating of the specific risk assessment documents, where required, to maintain an adequate risk assessment
in line with evolving situations and changes made to the production processes;

¢ — specific audits at the sites so as to monitor the practical application of the safety and environmental obligations
in accordance with the legislation in force;

¢ obtainment of OHSAS 18001:2007 certification (Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series) for the
Panoli plant.

The activities listed above consolidated the successes obtained over the past few years in reducing the number of
accidents, despite the increase in staff and production units.

It is pointed out that in Italy, in 2016, a total of 16 coordination meetings on health and safety issues were held,
mainly locally at the various production sites. Also at the Indian plant, the Health and safety committees meet up
periodically during the year.
