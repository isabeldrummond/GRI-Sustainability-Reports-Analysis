Safeguarding of biodiversity

 

With particular reference to safeguarding the biodiversity of the production sites:

Adria: the plant is situated in the municipality of Adria in the Po Delta Park in the region of Veneto instituted
through Regional law no. 36 of 8 September 1997. There is also a landscape protection area covering a strip of
150 mt along the Canal bianco in accordance with art 142 letters c-d of Legislative decree no. 42/2004.

Bussi: the plant is situated within the southern border of the Gran Sasso National Park. About 10 km
downstream of the plant is the “Alanno Dam” Regional Nature Reserve, which is situated on the Site of
Community Importance called La Maiella (SIC IT7140203) and it is also a Special Protection Area (SPA
1T7140129). The area lies between the river Pescara and the Alanno Dam, a reservoir almost completely
underground and occupied by the reed-bed of Cannuccia di Palude, partially destroyed by fire in 2011.

The risk for the company concerns its wastewater, the receptor of which is the river Pescara. In relation to
this, as the finished product is classified as hazardous for the environment, the company has implemented a
management system that reduces the risk of spillage to a minimum through the installation of containment
basins for the storage tanks and a double final containment basin into which flows all the water coming from
the plant.

Novara: the Terdoppio Canal, the receptor of the wastewater, flows into the River Ticino in the district of
Cassolnovo, a municipality situated inside “Ticino Park”. A radical change to the route followed by this
wastewater is currently under way, the new destination being the municipal sewer.
