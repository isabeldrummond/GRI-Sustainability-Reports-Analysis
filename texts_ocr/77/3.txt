Letter from the Chairman

 

The presentation of this first Non-Financial Report drawn up along the lines of our previous 14 Sustainability
Reports leads me to renew and share my reflection on the relationship between Sustainability and Innovation and
how the latter needs the former, its noblest values and its metrics to obtain the most significant effects on economic
and social development and the success of the corporate development model.

Sustainable innovation is an instrument that enables the company to grow because every one of its products is the
result of careful consideration of its use, functions and the monetary and environmental costs generated throughout
its life cycle.

This approach is adopted on a daily basis in all our activities and, in particular, in the search for new molecules and
solutions for agriculture that combine consolidated chemical research and development skills with an increasingly
low environmental impact, establishing new frontiers for sustainability, such as Biosolutions.

| am convinced that biosolutions represent a pillar of the Isagro model development project as an adequate
expression of integrated pest management, that is, the synergistic union between chemically-produced
agropharmaceuticals and bioproducts to preserve and strengthen crops, facing the food emergencies of vast areas
of our planet and other serious problems, in the name of health for humans, plants and the environment.

The Environmental Report published in 14 consecutive editions has undergone a significant evolution this year,
becoming our first Non-Financial Report structured in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards
issued by the Global Reporting Initiative.

We, too, consider sustainability an essential prerogative to guarantee the stability of an ecosystem, that is, the
ability to create well-being and progress, paying increasing attention to the economic, social, environmental and
governance impacts in the process.

The transposition of the European Directive on Non-financial information in the Italian legislation sees us again
at the forefront of awareness of the socioenvironmental topics that have always played a guiding role in the
development our Group’s activities.

The opportunity to fulfil this regulatory requirement thus allows us to integrate the summary of the indicators of
the company’s economic and financial situation with a representation, based on the principles of transparency and
objectiveness, of the impacts that our strategic model has on our internal and external setting and how the needs
and expectations of the stakeholders influence its development.

This approach is also one of the main principles lying at the basis of the company’s code of ethics, which identifies
maximum protection of the available resources as a top-priority requirement, in terms of investment, for any
industrial development.

Our long-standing membership of the Federchimica Responsible Care program is also a concrete expression of our

excellent performance in Sustainability issues.
