Methodological
note

Enel has been publishing a Sustainability Report with its Group Financial Report
since 2003.

In accordance with the requirements of Italian Legislative Decree no. 254 of Decem-
ber 30, 2016, “Implementation of Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament
and of the Council of October 22, 2014, amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards
disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings
and groups”, Enel has been publishing a Consolidated Non-Financial Statement
(NFS) since 2017. The Sustainability Report will constitute Enel’s NFS with effect
from financial year 2019. Accordingly, from this financial year on, the NFS will no
longer be published as a separate document. This Enel Group Sustainability Report
at December 31, 2019 has therefore been prepared in accordance with Legislative
Decree no. 254/16 and the 2019 Budget Act and is a separate document from the
Report on Operations. The document has been published in the “Investors” section
of Enel’s website (www.enel.com).

The 2019 Sustainability Report is addressed to the Enel Group's stakeholders and is
designed to present the actions taken in pursuit of the Group’s sustainability goals
and thus to respond to the legitimate expectations of all stakeholders. In contrast
to previous years, the structure of the document has been revised to include a new
initial chapter, the “At a Glance”, which provides a concise overview of the main
topics, discussed in detail in each chapter of the document.

To the extent necessary to ensure an understanding of the Company's activities,
performance, results and impact, this document covers environmental, social, la-
bour, human rights and anti-corruption and bribery topics that are material to Enel,
in view of the Company's activities and characteristics, according to the process de-
scribed below (see the section “The 2019 materiality analysis”). The following table
contains the areas required by Legislative Decree no. 254/16, with an indication of
the specific chapter of the document in which they are discussed.
