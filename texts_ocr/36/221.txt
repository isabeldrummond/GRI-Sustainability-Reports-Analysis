Transparent relationship
with stakeholders

The Enel Group ensures transparency and fairness in its re-
lations with tax authorities, in the event of audits on both
the Group companies and third parties. To consolidate this
transparency with tax authorities, the Enel Group promotes
engagement in co-operative compliance schemes for com-
panies that integrate the requirements of their respective
domestic regulations in order to reinforce their relations. It
also complies with the transfer pricing documentation provi-
sions in accordance with OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines
(the “three-tiered approach” consisting into Master File, Lo-
cal File and Country-by-Country Report). Moreover, to avoid
double taxation, the Group promotes mutual agreement
procedures for the settlement of international disputes (Mu-
tual Agreement Procedure — MAP), which have the direct in-
volvement of tax authorities from the contracting countries.
Lastly, Enel consistently acts with a transparent and collabo-
rative approach with all institutions and associations to sup-
port the development of effective tax systems in the various
countries where it operates.

In 2019, Enel joined the European Business Tax Forum (EBTF
— https://ebtforum.org), an association that aims to open up
a public debate on taxation by providing a balanced and
comprehensive perspective of the tax paid by companies.
In view of this objective, tax information is provided to the
various stakeholders. The EBTF has been operating since
2017 as an informal non-profit initiative by a group of multina-
tionals based in the EU and European Free Trade Association
(EFTA) in order to develop a long-term and high-value strate-
gy for companies playing an active role in the public debate
on taxation. In 2018 and 2019, the Forum underwent a major
expansion and gave rise to the EU/EFTA Total Tax Contribu-
tion Study. The study is available on the association's website
and reports aggregate data for the various types of tax paid
by the major European multinational companies by revenue
and/or market capitalisation.

Reporting

As of 2018 (2018-2017), Enel has adopted a Total Tax
Contribution model for Italy and the main countries where
it operates, providing evidence of the taxes paid and
withheld. The 2019 document (2019 and 2018) is available

220

at Enel — (https:/Awww.enel.com/investors/sustainability-
performance) and underlines the importance the Group
places on tax issues, their social role and transparency in
general, as a driver of sustainable development.

The comparative analysis of the 2019 and 2018 data revealed
an increase in 2019 of the Total Tax Borne for a total of
144.5 million euros (43.1%), and essentially: 1) the increase
in income taxes in Spain and Russia, amounting to 90 and
22 million euros respectively due to the higher advances
amounts paid in 2019 and lower tax credits offset by the
two countries in the same year, and Mexico, amounting
to 73 million euros due to the one-off payment of taxes
on extraordinary transactions; 2) the increase in taxes on
products and services in Brazil amounting to 85 million
euros for the payment of PIS and Cofins on revenue that
increased by around 2,000 million euros in the country from
2018 to 2019. These increases — totalling 270 million euros —
are partly offset by the environmental tax reduction in Spain
totalling 106 million euros, essentially due to the following
factors: reduction of the tax on hydrocarbons in electricity
generation and general tax reduction on coal and on the
electricity generation value as a result of the suspension/
closure of coal power plants.

With regard to the Total Tax Collected, the increase in 2019
totalling 236 million euros (+1.7%) was essentially the result
of: 1) the increase in taxes on products and services in Bra-
zil, Chile, Peru and Russia, totalling 286 million euros, due
to the general increase in revenues in the various countries,
partially offset by the reduction of these taxes in Italy total-
ling 85 million euros, mainly due to the reduction of taxes on
sales to end customers gas and electricity; 2) the increase
in taxes on labour, mainly in Italy and Spain amounting to 15
and 24 million euros respectively.

Lastly, the TTC index rose from 38.4% in 2018 to 64.7% in
2019; this 26.2% variation is almost exclusively the result of
the reduction of Earnings Before Tax (EBT) in 2019 — totalling
4,710 million euros — mainly associated with the impairment
of several coal plants in Italy, Spain, Chile and Russia as part
of the Group's decarbonization process. As this impairment
is not immediately tax deductible, it did not have a correlated
impact on the reduction of income taxes paid in 2019.

The table below shows information relating to the overall tax
contribution for 2019 in the main countries where the Enel
Group operates (TTC 2019).
