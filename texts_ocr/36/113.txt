commitments from an ESG point of view, including access
to energy and the corresponding financial and non-financial
reporting are analysed and monitored by the Board of Direc-
tors, through the Corporate Governance and Sustainability
Committee and the Control and Risk Committee (see the
Corporate Governance report, available at www.enel.com).
Top management is engaged on a daily basis in realising
these strategic objectives by contributing towards support-
ing the global challenge of guaranteeing access to energy. In
line with Enel's sustainable business model, each business
line/country promotes specific initiatives for its area of re-
sponsibility, such as the development of renewable assets
in mature countries and in developing countries (Global Pow-
er Generation Business Line), energy efficiency, responsible
consumption and offers dedicated to vulnerable segments
(Infrastructure and Networks, Enel X, Market-Countries). To
support top management, each country is responsible for
managing relationships with institutional bodies, regulatory
authorities on a national, regional and local level, and as-
sociations for promoting the development of solutions for
access to energy according to different needs. The Innov-
ability Function, both on a holding level as well as a busi-
ness line/country level, also promotes the dissemination of
a shared value model. It supports innovative solutions that
can promote access to energy in remote areas with limited
access to electricity. An example is the world’s first “Plug
and Play” micro-grid launched in Chile, which is powered
by a photovoltaic source with a hydrogen storage system
that guarantees the supply of green energy for 24 hours,
anywhere, without having to use diesel generators and is
able to operate both on-grid or off-grid.

Promoting access to energy
in developing countries

Enel’s commitment to promoting access to energy in de-
veloping countries does not only involve the supply of elec-
tricity, but also the possibility to supply innovative and clean
technologies to the population in order to produce energy
with a reduced impact on the environment. For example, in
Latin America in 2019, 347 MW from renewable sources be-
came operational, increasing the total renewable capacity to
around 13,700 MW. In Africa, Enel Green Power is currently
the main private operator in the renewable sector in terms of

installed capacity (more than 600 MW in operation and 900
MW under construction), with a presence in different coun-
tries, including South Africa and Zambia. In Asia, the Group
is present in India through its subsidiary BLP Energy, one
of the country’s main renewable energy companies, which
owns and manages 172 MW of wind capacity, producing
approximately 300 GWh a year in Gujarat and Maharashtra.
In parallel to the development of new renewable capaci-
ty, and in line with what is required by the SDGs, Enel has
defined a specific commitment for SDG 7 “Affordable and
clean energy”: reach 10 million people by 2030. This target
is expressed through projects related, for example, to rural
electrification, development of capacity, technology transfer,
financial support to promote access to energy or innovative
solutions, as well as partnership agreements with relevant
stakeholders. In 2019, in developing countries alone, slightly
more than 200 projects were created that reached approx-
imately 1.1 million beneficiaries. During 2018-2019, more
than 200 partnerships were stipulated regarding this topic
(see the paragraph “Listening to stakeholders, knowing the
territory and measuring created value”).
Some examples are provided below of initiatives that Enel
is adopting in developing countries to support access to en-
ergy and that were promoted by the various business lines.
> Cundinamarca 100% (Colombia): the programme
aims to provide energy to families in areas that are dif-
ficult to access with wide geographical dispersion. The
project was started in 2016 with the participation of pub-
lic partners and private associations, using three meth-
ods: connection to conventional power grids, installation
of solar panels with back-up batteries and the construc-
tion of a mini-grid to guarantee access to energy 24/7. In
2019, 722 new families were connected, increasing the
total number of connected families to 2,533. In addition
to guaranteeing access to energy, the programme also
