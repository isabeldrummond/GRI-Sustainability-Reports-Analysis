The attention paid to quality of service issues is confirmed
again this year by the results of customer satisfaction sur-
veys carried out in all the countries where Enel operates as
an electricity vendor or distributor.

In Italy, the customer satisfaction index (CSI) for 2019 was
92.4' for the regulated market (92.4 in 2018) and 90.2! for
the free market (90.2 in 2018). In addition, monthly satis-
faction surveys are carried out among customers who have
received an answer to a written or verbal complaint. The
survey is conducted by telephone interview after a response
has been sent or the customer has been contacted by tele-
phone.

In Iberia, through the subsidiary Endesa, efficient customer
service is the main value pursued in the relationship with
customers, striving for maximum efficiency in the opera-
tion of its customer service channels, tools and platforms
through a process of constant innovation and improvement.
20 key indicators are monitored every month to ensure re-
spect for the improvements identified during the previous
year. The CSI has been improving over the years, reaching
7.3 for the free market (7.2 in 2018) and remaining at 7.2 for
the regulated market in 2019.

In Romania, customers can voice their opinions via the con-
tact centre, e-mail and website. The information is gathered
once a month and the results used to improve the quality
of service and business processes. The general satisfaction
index was 855 (87 in 2018) for the free market and 89% for the
regulated market (86 in 2018).

In Latin America, customer satisfaction indicators are a
fundamental consideration when defining strategies and
designing new products. In Brazil, customer satisfaction is
measured using a specific index calculated by the Brazilian
association of electricity distributors (ABRADEE - Associacéo

   

The value is calculated on a scale of 1 to 100. For 2019, the values have
been estimated on the basis of established trends. Following a change of
methodology, from 2018, the CSI value is determined annually rather than
half-yearly as it was in 2017 and 2016.

The value is calculated on a scale of 1 to 10.

The value is calculated on a scale of 1 to 100. The fall recorded on the free
market in 2019 relates to the replacement of the customer management
IT platform with a more advanced one (SAP platform). The learning curve
of the telephone operators was reflected in the quality of service provided

Brasileira de Distribuidores de Energia Elétrica). The index is
determined after conducting a sample survey among cus-
tomers on aspects such as: energy supply, information and
communication, utility bills, customer support and image.
In Peru as well, surveys are carried out, using structured
and standardised questionnaires, among people who have
used the contact point services. Finally, in Colombia, there
is a customer satisfaction form designed to measure market
perception of the supply of products and services in order to
direct initiatives and the respective resources more efficient-
ly. The quality satisfaction index (ISCAL), the key elements
of which include the commercial relationship and billing, has
remained at excellent levels in recent years, thanks to the
development of the customer relationship plan.

Management of complaints

In all the countries where Enel operates, customers have var-
ious channels available through which to make a complaint
or request information (post, website, toll-free number). Enel
constantly monitors the feedback received, in order to un-
derstand the customer's perception and any ongoing critical
issues and to implement the appropriate corrective actions.
In Italy, for example, through the company Enel Energia, the
Enel Group monitors the commercial quality of all its contact
channels, systematically monitoring the sales and manage-
ment processes. The goal is to ensure the fulfilment of the
requirements in compliance with current legislation, priva-
cy and rules protecting the freedom and dignity of workers.
Customer reports are managed through dedicated channels
and analysed by a specific working group so that the most
suitable actions are taken, both at the complaint manage-
ment stage and, above all, in preventing the underlying
causes. This year there was a reduction in the time required
to manage the complaint, which fell below the minimum
times required by ARERA (Regulatory Authority for Energy,
Networks and the Environment) which simultaneously in-
creased the satisfaction of complaining customers.

In Iberia, complaints are managed both centrally by the “At-
encién de Reclamaciones” (complaint management) unit
and locally through six local units, in order to prevent any
disruptions and determine the appropriate tools needed to
