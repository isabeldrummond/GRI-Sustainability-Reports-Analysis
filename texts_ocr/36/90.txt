residential photovoltaic systems, including small ones,
equipped with storage, enabling them to provide net-
work services and preparing them to make part of their
capacity available, thus contributing to the security and
flexibility of the electricity system;

+> Click Enel, platform for Colombian customers who do
not have a credit card, allowing them to purchase online
subscriptions with the fee added to their electricity bill;

> EV Trip Planning and Anagog, two projects that im-
prove the customer's experience of electric mobility
through travel planning that takes into account the vehi-
cle's charge status, driving and road conditions, offering
increasingly personalised services aimed at reducing
“range anxiety” and making everyone understand the
advantages of electric mobility;

> Juice Ability, which offers users with physical disabili-

ties the opportunity to recharge their electric wheelchair
through the Enel X charging infrastructure;

with the aim of enriching Enel X's commercial offer with
new digital products and services for public adminis-
tration, there are projects such as City Analytics 2.0,
which, by analysing Big Data applied to geo-localised
data flows, allows the urban areas with the highest “hu-
man presence” to be identified and displayed, clearly
showing urban mobility and tourist flows; Urban Adver-
tising, where digital screens and totems, integrated and
combined with urban furniture, allow people to commu-
nicate, inform and display advertisements; Smart Pole,
a new public lamppost that also provides services such
as video surveillance, wi-fi, defibrillator, SOS button
and multifunction socket using the same infrastructure
base.

Furthermore, circular guidelines have been established for maintenance services to spread circular economy
practices among the network of Enel X installers and maintainers for the e-Home Business Line in Italy; some com-
mercial agreements have been established (including Enel X solutions) for our tradesmen, as well as a specific Enel X
programme to reward the “circular” services and circular choices of our customers.

Enel X Circular Economy Client Report

During 2019, the first seven Circular Economy Client Report were finalised.

For public administration, Enel X has developed a new assessment model aimed at assessing the level of energy

circularity of municipalities on two levels: at city level and specific site level.

For cities, the assessment covers five areas: circular economy, energy, mobility, waste, emissions. Each of these

areas is assessed on the basis of four dimensions:

+> governance & policy (existence of local targets and plans to promote the circular economy and related issues);

+> support tools (promotion of municipal initiatives and incentives aimed at promoting circularity towards citizens and
the private sector);

+> digitalization (integration of digital tools to enable, promote or facilitate the adoption of circular behaviour by citizens
and the private sector);

+ status quo (assessment of the current status and targets achieved on items related to the circular economy).

For the specific site, the assessment focuses on the energy aspects of the building under analysis. In particular, the as-

iency, energy management, circularity enablers (for example,

 

sessment areas are: renewable energy, energy effi
network services, electric mobility solutions)

The first complete Circular Economy Report pilot dedicated to public ad: ration was the one produced for the
Municipality of Serrenti (South Sardinia) and its school; a small Sardinian municipality that won the Cresco Award

 

in 2018, as it is rated as one of the Italian municipalities that is investing most in the renewable energy and smart grids
sector. In addition to the Report the municipality was also supplied with a citizens’ annex, a booklet containing a simple
summary of the main findings of the Report.
