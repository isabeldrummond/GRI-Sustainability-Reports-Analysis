Assessment of the priorities assigned
by the stakeholders to the issues

 

The aspects investigated within the context of the materi-
ality analysis are, from the stakeholders’ perspective, the
relative importance of each issue in their perceptions and
the ‘direction’ of their expectations (expectations of en-
gagement, rather than disengagement, by Enel), and, from
the Company's perspective, the level of the impact of the
issues on its corporate strategies.

Since 2016 Enel has integrated the process of assessing
the level of satisfaction of stakeholders’ expectations with
regard to presidium of an issue by the Company: the re-
sults achieved, compared with the stakeholder materiality
analysis, provide an overview of stakeholders’ expecta-
tions and help identify the topics on which the Company
should focus.

During 2019, the results of numerous engagement ini-
tiatives carried out by Enel focusing on Group's relevant
stakeholders, such as the financial community, national
and international organizations, authorities, representative
and trade associations, suppliers, customers, civil society
and Enel's people have been assessed. There was found to
be increasing capitalization on feedback initiatives to mon-
itor the results of operational management by the Com-
pany and its Business Lines. In this regard, examples of
this are the customer satisfaction surveys carried out by
the various Market areas, the climate survey conducted
by the Global People and Organization Function, the on-
line survey addressed to suppliers by Global Procurement
and the questionnaires for sustainability rating agencies ad-
ministered by the Holding unit. Other sources considered
in the analysis are complaints from customers, relations
with analysts and investors, relations with representative
and trade associations, institutional relations at the national
and local level, trade union relations, media monitoring and
opinion polls.

Each unit responsible for relations with stakeholders in
the countries of presence seeks to engage an increasingly
large number of stakeholders, while selecting those who
are most relevant to the activities pertaining to the unit
itself. In particular, in 2019 within the framework of the

Methodological note

 

Infrastructure and Networks Business Line, the Sustaina-
bility unit in Brazil conducted engagement initiatives focus-
ing above all on regulatory bodies and customers, whereas
the Sustainability unit of Enel Chile focused on the use of
questionnaires for investors and rating agencies. In some
cases, where necessary, stakeholder engagement is car-
ried out on an ad hoc basis for the performance of the
materiality analysis and then used for the purposes of the
Report.
