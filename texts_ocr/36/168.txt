at Enel Group sites?

 

Launch of the programme

to reduce single-use plastics across
all geographical areas and definition
of an overall target by 2022

1. Following the adoption of the new GRI 303, from 2018 the values shown to date as a specific consumption are indicated as a specific requirement.
2 Following the definition of the emission reduction target by 2030, certified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), these targets were recalculated and
based on 2017 values to ensure correct consistency and alignment. The 2022 targets compared to baseline year 2017 for SO,, NO, and dust are respectively

-80%, 45%, and -90%.

3 The target set by each country is calculated in relation to the volume of single-use plastic used and refers to 2018.

4. This does not include offices with less than 20 employees.
