Climate risks

Physical risks arising from climate change can be classified as
acute (,e. extreme events) and chronic: the former are linked to
extremely intense weatherclimatic conditions, while the latter
refers to gradual but structural changes in climatic conditions.
Extreme events may expose the Group to a potential unavai-
lability of assets and infrastructures, restoration costs, and in-
convenience for customers, etc. Chronic changes in climatic
conditions, on the other hand, may expose the Group to other
physical risks or opportunities (depending on the geographi-
cal location): for example, structural rainfall or wind changes
could impact the Group's business in terms of generation,
while structural temperature changes could have an impact on
electricity demand.

With regard to the energy transition process moving towards a
more sustainable model with a progressive electrification and
reduction in CO,, emissions, in line with the Group's strate-
gy for carbon neutrality by 2050, there are risks, but above all
opportunities, tied to the changing regulatory context, techno-
logical and electrification trends, and resulting market develop-
ments, with potential effects also on commodities and energy
prices.

The Group is committed to making continuous improvements
to the environmental impact of its activities. It has constantly
improved its emissions reduction targets, certifying a target
with the SBTi in 2019 for 125 g/kWh of CO, by 2030, head-
ing for "zero emission generation” by 2050. For the Groups
strategy, the decarbonization and electrification of consump-
tion are two key pillars: considering also the enablers of digital
platforms and ecosystems and infrastructures for the energy
transition, the Group is dedicating around 95% of the total
investments planned for the 2020-2022 period to climate ac-
tions. The Group's strategic actions make it possible to miti-
gate the potential risks and grasp the opportunities provided
by transition variables. Enel participates in the entire electricity
value chain and has a diversified portfolio of activities, both in
terms of generation technologies and the geographical areas
and markets where it operates, mitigating climate change risks
and their economic and financial impacts.

Weather and climate phenomena management adopts the
best strategies for prevention, protection and boosting resit
ience, while also carrying out weather forecasting activities.
Moreover, best practices are implemented on physical events
to ensure a prompt recovery of operating conditions in the
event of adverse events. In terms of insurance risk assessment
activities, the Group manages a loss prevention programme for
property risks, which also serves to assess the main exposures
linked to natural events. All areas of the Group are subject to
the ISO 14001 certification and, by applying internationally
recognised Environmental Management Systems (EMSs|, po-
tential sources of risk are monitored so that any critical issue
may be promptly identified. The Group develops short-, medi
um and long-term scenarios in the energy and the financial
macroeconomic sectors in order to support its strategic and
industrial planning, investment valuation, scenario planning and
extraordinary transactions.

By gradually integrating climate and transition scenarios, com-
bined with the development of energy system models at coun-
‘ry level, itis possible to intercept the effects on variables such
as electricity demand, the system energy mix and the electr-
fication of consumption. These activities make it possible to
identify and assess related risks and opportunities.

Further information on how this risk is managed can be found in
the chapter “Commitment to the fight against climate change”
