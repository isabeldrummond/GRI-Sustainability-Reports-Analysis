Data protection

 

The protection and processing of personal data is a major
challenge in the age of digitalization and market globalisation
in terms of responsibility when managing data, but it is also
an opportunity to improve the service that Group companies
provide. To rise to this challenge and in line with the new
General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679 (GDPR),
the Enel Group adopted a structure in 2017 to ensure that
the privacy of all natural persons with whom it interacts is

fully respected. Specifically, the Legal Function contains a

Data Protection Office, which has assigned “Data Protection

Officers” (or DPOs). DPOs are appointed based on their pro-

fessional skills, knowledge and their ability to perform tasks

in accordance with the principle of independence.

The Data Protection Office is structured as follows:

> Governance Data Protection: This monitors changes
to legislation on data protection and determines the
Group's compliance;

> Global Service Functions and Holding Functions
Data Protection: This promotes privacy from the outset
of planning processes at global level and ensures con-
sistent development at national level;

+ Global Business Lines Data Protection: This supports
Global Business Lines in accordance with data protec-
tion, and monitors changes to data protection certifica-
tion mechanisms for products and services;

> Country units for the protection of national data (Ita-
ly, Portugal, Romania, Spain): These monitor changes to
data protection legislation at country level.

The Data Protection Office has also developed internal tools

based on Enel's size and complexity to ensure compliance

with the protection and optimal use of data to support Enel's
presence in the European data economy. Some of these
tools include: Personal data processing logs and the Data

Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). The DPO implements

232

processes and activities in accordance with the GDPR and
commits to support data officers in drawing up data protec-
tion agreements and clauses; planning data governance and
corporate policies; providing privacy consulting in the design
and default phase; ensuring adequate risk management by
making wide use of the DPIA and monitoring the consisten-
cy of data protection policies within the organisation, particu-
larly between legal entities within and outside Europe.
Moreover, the Audit Function carries out continuous moni-
toring of the GDPR’s implementation, in collaboration with
data protection officers, in order to track the progress of the
efforts to align the companies’ processes and tools with the
GDPR. Activities are also planned to analyse security meas-
ures on systems that contain data relevant to the GDPR,
commercially sensitive data (Distribution and Market) and
employee data managed in human resources procedures,
including in different geographical areas outside of the scope
of the GDPR.

In 2019, the Group's European companies handled over
40,000 communications relating to personal data protection
and have collaborated with national authorities, having re-
ceived 79 requests for information and clarification. In Italy,
E-Distribuzione previously reported one incident relating to
personal data and one data breach to the Authority for the
Protection of Personal Data. In Romania, two data breaches
were registered, formally notified to the competent Authori-
ty, which involved the market companies (Enel Energie Mun-
tenia and Enel Energie SA) and the distribution companies
(E-Distributie Muntenia, E-Distributie Dobrogea and E-Dis-
tributie Banat).

Lastly, promoting a responsible and proactive approach to
incorporate privacy right from the planning stage of pro-
cesses, corporate services and activities, a specific train-
ing course has been set up for the people working at Enel.
