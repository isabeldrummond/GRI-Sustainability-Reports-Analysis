The energy and competence of people,
and a shared vision make it possible to
manage ever increasing levels of com-
plexity while maintaining commitments
assumed with the market. Progress
springs from ideas and co-creation, and
is fuelled by values such as trust, respon-
sibility, proactivity and innovation.

At the end of 2019 Enel people in the
various Group countries totalled 68,253
(down by 1,019 vs 2018), of which 44%
in Italy, 15% in Iberia, 30% in Latin Amer-
ica, 21% women, 12% under 30 years of
age, 55% from 30 to 50 and 34% over
50. People with disabilities or persons in
protected categories totalled 2,254. The
inclusion of this diversity makes it possible
to adopt innovative solutions, enhance the
contribution of multiple perspectives and
have different risk perceptions, effectively
generating social and economic value.

In a scenario of transformation, char-
acterised by a high level of automa-
tion, ever more advanced technological
evolution and new technical and pro-
fessional profiles, Enel has developed
upskilling and reskilling programmes
that promote the evolution of talents
and skills. In particular, the upskilling
programmes are focused on the devel-
opment of existing professional compe-
tences and adding new skills. Converse-
ly, reskilling is aimed at creating new
professional profiles, replacing skills
that have become obsolete or are no

longer required and allowing people to
work on new areas of specialisation.

Training i:
the growth of all individuals, stimulat-
ing personal initiative, self-learning and a
pro-active spirit. In 2019, around 39 train-
ing hours per capita were supplied on av-
erage, for a total or more than 2.6 million
hours. Specifically, 46% of people were
involved in activities aimed at strength-
ening digital skills. Technical-specialist
training programmes in different busi-
ness areas were also promoted through
the vehicle of schools and academies.
Enel however also focuses on more ex-
perientially based training, such as job
shadowing, which arises from interaction
between individuals with different roles
and responsibilities, who open up to new

 

increasingly a partner in

inputs in a scenario of training and recipro-
cal sharing of skills and aptitudes.
Openness and listening are core as-
pects of the Open Power culture and
they constitute the engine of the climate
survey conducted by Enel at two-yearly
intervals. The 2018 survey focused on
topics such as well-being, engagement,
and safety. In 2019, action plans were
defined and developed for the identified
areas of improvement.

The recruitment, hiring, development
and performance appraisal processes
form the foundation of relations with
people within the Company. Enel has
made a commitment to guarantee equal
representation of both genders in the in-
itial stages of its recruitment and hiring
processes within 2021. At the end of

2019, the number of women in recruit-
ment pools totalled 42% (39% in 2018).
The quantitative and qualitative perfor-
mance appraisal process of the past year
involved 100% of eligible and reachable
people’, of whom a total of 99%* were
appraised. Conversely, the quantitative
assessment was carried out exclusively
for the population with variable remu-
neration. Finally, the equal remuneration
rating (ERR®) related to the managerial
population was equal to approximately
84% in 2019.
