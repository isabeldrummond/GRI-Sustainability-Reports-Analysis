Another strategic objective of Enel's environmental policy is
optimum waste management (for further information, re-
fer to point 5 of the environmental policy) which details the
specific lines of action inspired by the Waste Hierarchy Pre-
vention community principles and by the circular economy.
In order to further reinforce this commitment and within the
perspective of continuous improvement, throughout 2019
Enel introduced Group Guidelines on Waste Manage-
ment, where best practices deemed fundamental for opti-
mum waste management were collected and collated under
a common denominator for all the Business Lines, for waste
directly produced or produced by subcontractors’ activities.
Waste management strategies adopted across all Enel pro-
duction sites mainly focus on preventing waste produc-
tion, particularly hazardous waste, thereby maximising
the quantities for reuse, recycling or recovery, such as
by-products, secondary raw materials or used as energy
sources only using waste disposal to landfills in accordance
with legal requirements, as a last resort.

Enel specifically set important waste product reduction
targets, as shown in the “2020-2030 Target” on waste
There was also a greater effort in acquiring transparent and

 

Environmental sustainability

comparable information on the environmental impact of
substances and supplied products, in an eventual life-cy-
cle; for example taking into account the environmental prod-
uct declarations, where available.

Similarly, increasing focus was also placed on the adoption
of the Extended Producer Responsibility models (EPR)
also in relation to the post-consumption phases of the prod-
ucts and services provided. Of particular interest in relation
to this in 2019 was the Enel X commitment in using a model
integrated with the e-mobility services which ensured a rig-
orous and efficient end-of-life management of the electric
car recharging infrastructures (box stations, pole stations,
fast-recharges) and their recovery (up to 95% in weight) as
WEEE products through its membership, in Italy, in the Re-
media consortium.

In the same way, the environmental qualification of all
providers, including specifically providers of waste process-
ing and recovery services, has become an integral part of
Enel’s environmental management model. This seeks to pro-
mote increasingly higher levels of requirements in relation to
environmental sustainability management across its entire
supplier base.

The commitment to a continuous increase in the percentile
recovery of waste produced is fundamental to ensure an
efficient transition from a linear economy to a circular econo-
my in order to minimise the exploitation of natural resources
in accordance with sustainable objectives and in combating
climate change.

The significant recovery of process waste arising from
thermal power generation plays a fundamental role in this
due to the significant quantities linked to the progress of the
production activities and to their chemical-physical proper
ties. These mainly include coal ash and desulphurisation gyp-
sum, reused in building works to produce cement, concrete
and bricks according to specific technical and environmental
control requirements. Many other maintenance products
are sent for complete recovery from the thermal power
stations, such as waste oils, a large number of metal waste
products, iron, copper, aluminium as well as waste from pri-
mary filtration processes in the hydroelectric plants.

An important commitment was furthermore undertaken last
year to focus on ensuring the recovery of waste products
arising from demolition and dismantling of end-of-life
