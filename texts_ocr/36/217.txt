Transparency in institutional processes

Enel constantly manages relations with institutions (local,
national, European and international), in line with the Enel
Compliance Program, providing complete and transparent
information with the aim of giving institutional counterparts
the best conditions to make the decisions they are
responsible for. Enel also contributes to the consultation
processes regarding political and legislative dossiers on
energy and environmental issues. In the context of relations
with European institutions, Enel actively contributes to every
phase of the consultation process on political and legislative
dossiers of corporate interest through careful monitoring
and analysis (see also the chapter “Commitment to the fight
against climate change”).

The Enel Group has been registered in the EU voluntary
transparency register since its creation in 2008. The register
aims to provide citizens with a single and direct access
point to information on who carries out activities aimed at
influencing the EU decision-making process, the interests
pursued and the resources invested in these activities (http://
ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/homePage.do)
In line with the provisions of the Code of Ethics, paragraph
3.26, Enel does not provide finance to political parties, their
representatives or candidates in Italy or abroad, nor does
it sponsor conventions or parties whose sole purpose is
political propaganda. It refrains from any direct or indirect
pressure on politicians (for example, by granting the use
of its facilities, accepting recruiting recommendations, or
consultancy contracts). Enel and its subsidiaries are present
in various trade and employer associations whose role
includes representing the positioning of its members in the
regulatory processes pertaining to the business activity.
