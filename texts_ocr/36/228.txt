Since 2011, the “United Nations Guiding Principles on Busi-
ness and Human Rights” (UNGPs) have been a key point
of reference for companies to evaluate their management
systems and respective impacts on human rights, assuming
direct responsibility for them.

In particular, the guiding principles on companies set out the
following framework:

Protect

Safeguarding human rights through appropriate
policies and rules

Respect

Companies must “know and show”
their impacts on human rights
and the measures to mitigate and correct them

Companies must implement remedial actions
through judicial and non-judicial system

Protect

On 5 February 2013, Enel passed resolution to accept the
United Nations’ “Protect, Respect, Remedy” framework
by approval of the Board of Directors — both of the Parent
Company and each subsidiary — of a human rights policy
that strengthens and deepens the commitments already es-
tablished by company Compliance Programmes. The policy
was drawn up through a consultation process that involved
the Enel people and major international experts. It identifies
eight principles that the people working in Enel SpA and its
subsidiaries must observe in carrying out all their activities.
Furthermore, it promotes respect of all principles within its
business relationships and compliance with the same stand-
ards by its contractors, suppliers and business partners, with
a particular focus on conflict-affected and high-risk contexts.
The policy concerns two overarching issues: labour practices
and relations with communities and society. This policy is
available online at www.enel.com

Sound governance

 

Labour practices:
1. Rejection of forced or compulsory labour and child labour;
2. Respect for diversity and non-discrimination;

3. Freedom of association and collective bargaining;

 

4. Health and safety;

5. Fair and favourable working conditions;

Relations with communities and society:
1. Respect for community rights;
2. Integrity: zero tolerance of corruption;

3. Privacy and communication.

The principles set out in the policy have been inspired by
the content of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
the European Convention on Human Rights and several
International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions on
human and social rights, freedom of association and the
right to organise, prohibition of forced and child labour, and
occupational health and safety.

The policy assigns the Innovability Function the following
tasks: planning and coordinating the adoption of due
diligence process” jointly with the other relevant Functions,
for their respective areas of competence; reporting to
the Control and Risks Committee on the development
of the due diligence process; annually reporting on Enel’s
performance regarding its commitments to human rights
as part of the Group's Sustainability Report. In particular,
within the Innovability Function, the Sustainability Planning
and Performance Management unit has been tasked with
managing the positioning on human rights and respective
internal and external disclosure on activities, as well as
integrating the human rights policy into corporate processes
and ensuring the performance of due diligence activities.
Moreover, a specific focal point at global level was also
appointed within this unit to coordinate human rights
activities, to be coordinated by the various Sustainability
Managers at country level.

12In the context of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
(Principles 17-21), this term refers to @ continuous management system
implemented by a company considering the sector in which it operates,
its operating contexts and the size of the company, among other things,
to ensure respect for human rights or to avoid being party to their abuse.
This implies “identifying, preventing, mitigating and reporting” potentially
negative effects caused by the company.
