Supplier Performance
Management

Enel assesses and monitors the performance of its suppli-
ers — both during the procurement process and execution of
contracts — through the Supplier Performance Management
(SPM) process. This aims not only to take restructuring ac-
tions, where necessary, but also to encourage suppliers
to improve by incentivising best practices through reward
schemes.
The Supplier Performance Management process is regulat-
ed by a dedicated procedure and based on an objective and
systematic disclosure of data and information on the execu-
tion of the work defined by the contract. This data is used
to develop specific indicators, also called Categories (Qual-
ity, Punctuality, Health and Safety, Environment, Human
Rights and Fairness and Innovation & Collaboration), which
are combined to form a weighted average and produce the
Supplier Performance Index (SPI). The categories and SPI
can be used as assessment elements for participation in
tenders and for the continuation of contractual relationship
in accordance with the applicable local requirements. Moni-
toring activities are conducted by the various Business Lines
with the support of the relevant HSE units, where applica-
ble, and the Qualification & Vendor Rating unit. In addition,
all individuals who interact with suppliers have the opportu-
nity to express their own assessment through the dedicated
“Track & Rate” app.
For suppliers with poor performance, Enel adopts solutions
that can have an impact on:
+> the qualification system (for example, suspending the
qualification, reviewing the application class, placement
on the blacklist, exclusion from the list of qualified sup-
pliers, etc.); and/or
> the contract (for example, further investigation, im-
provement plan, contract termination, reduction in vol-
umes, option not required, etc.).
In the event of critical issues in the conduct of a supplier, an
action plan may be drawn up jointly, the execution of which
is constantly monitored by Enel.
Through the SPM process, 450 MCs and 2,282 contractors
were monitored last year (versus 398 MCs and around 2,423
contractors in 2018).

Sustainable supply chain

Monitoring systems

In each stage of the procurement process, there are spe-
cific committees made up of representatives both of the
purchasing department and Business Lines, with the task of
assessing and monitoring supplier performance. In particu-
lar, the following committees have been set up:

1 Qualification committee;

2 Integrity committee: this includes representatives from
Global Procurement, the Legal Function and Security
Function. It meets every time a critical issue arises, such
as an investigation or proceedings relating to breaches
by a supplier, and periodically (usually monthly) to share
and analyse situations which require specific actions/
sanctions to be applied to supplier companies.

Moreover, individual country-specific units ("Contract Con-
trols Area”) have been set up to carry out checks on the
responsible management of the supply chain and assess
and manage risks relating to joint and several liability (appli-
cable to successful tenderers and any subcontractors). The
checks include an initial mass document analysis to assess
the correct contribution and proper fulfilment of suppliers’
contractual obligations. Next, there is a second level check
on a sample of tenders to carry out targeted and thorough
checks with on-site inspections.

Training and information

   

 

In recent years, Enel has held several meetings with contrac-
tors on sustainability issues to exchange different ideas and
approaches. At individual country level, numerous meetings
have been held more regularly in the last two years with con-
tractors to discuss sustainability issues (Suppliers Days held
in Italy, Peru, Colombia, Spain, Romania and Brazil). More-
over, on the Global Procurement website, articles are peri-
odically published showing Group's commitment to these
issues (https://globalprocurement.enel.com).

Again in relation to protection and awareness, particularly in
terms of health and safety, Enel has undertaken numerous
initiatives to engage contractors. There has been a signifi-
cant decrease in accidents at work in recent years thanks to
these initiatives.
