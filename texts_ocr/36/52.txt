Climate scenarios

The Group develops short, medium and long-term scenarios

for the energy industry and for macroeconomic and finan-

cial conditions in order to support its strategic and industrial

planning, the evaluation of investments and extraordinary

corporate transactions. The role of climate change in these

scenarios is increasingly important in terms of:

+> acute events (heat waves, flooding, hurricanes, etc.)
and their potential impact on industrial assets;

+> chronic phenomena related to structural changes in the
climate, such as the rising trend in temperatures, rising
sea levels, etc., which give rise to changes in the output
of generation plants and in electricity consumption pro-
files in the residential and commercial sectors;

> transition of the various industrial and business sectors
towards a green economy characterised by ever lower
emissions levels

The issues connected with future trends in climate varia-

bles (in terms of acute and chronic phenomena) define the

so-called “physical scenario”, while the issues associated

with the industrial and economic transition towards solu-

tions to reduce atmospheric concentrations of CO, are the

ion scenario”. The

 

characteristic elements of the “tran:
adoption of these scenarios and their integration into corpo-
rate processes takes account of the guidelines of the TCFD
and enables the assessment of the risks and opportunities
connected with climate change.

The physical climate
scenario

Among the climate projections developed by the Intergovern-

mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on a global scale, the

Group has selected two representing a specific level of emis-

sions (the so-called “Representative Concentration Pathway”):

+> Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP 2.6):
compatible with global warming of less than 2 °C above
pre-industrial levels by 2100, or an average of about 1 °C
in 2081-2100;

> Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5):
compatible with a scenario where no particular measures

Commitment to the fight against climate change

are taken to combat climate change, a so-called “busi-
ness as usual scenario”. In this scenario, a mean global
temperature increase of about 4.3 °C above pre-industrial
levels is forecast for 2081-2100.
In the RCP 8.5 climate projections, the Mediterranean and
Central/South America will experience a significant increase
in average temperatures and substantial decline in precipi-
tation, with the effects becoming more pronounced in the
second half of the century and the impact increasing up to
2100. In the RCP 2.6 scenario, the effects will be similar
but less intense, with the trend slowing in the second half
of the century, thereby producing a substantial differential
between the two scenarios in 2100.
The scenarios are global in nature. Accordingly, in order to
determine their effects in the areas of relevance for the
Group, a collaborative initiative has been started with the
Earth Sciences department of the International Center for
Theoretical Physics (ICTP) of Trieste. As part of this collab-
oration, the ICTP provides projections for the major climate
variables with a grid resolution of 50 km? and a forecast ho-
rizon running from 2030 to 2050. The main variables are av-
erage temperatures, rainfall and snowfall and solar radiation.
The first phase of the study conducted in 2019 involved Italy
and Spain, with the consequent definition of a preliminary
physical scenario.

Italy

Acute phenomena: in the 2030-2050 period, heat waves
are expected to increase appreciably both in terms of fre-
quency and geographical distribution, especially in the south-
ern regions of the country. In these scenarios, the intensity
of extreme rain and snowfall events increases sharply, but
their frequency declines compared with historic trends.
Chronic phenomena: the average annual temperature is
expected to increase over the 2030-2050 period in both the
RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios. In the RCP 8.5 scenario, the tem-
perature is expected to be an average of 0.4 °C compared
with the RCP 2.6 scenario in the 2030-2050 period, with the
differential then widening significantly in the second half of
the century. Chronic changes in temperature can be ana-
lysed to obtain information on the potential effects on cool-
ing and heating demand in local energy systems. In terms
