Emissions

1] [3057]

 

Constant reduction of environmental impacts associated
with the running of our power plants is a strategic objec-
tive pursued by Enel by applying the best available tech-
nologies and intemational practices. In 2019, the values
of CO, and pollutant emissions decreased both as regards
mass emissions as well as for the specific values due to
reduced thermoelectric generation, in particular coal-fired, in
comparison to 2018. The reduced thermoelectric generation
resulted partially from the removal of the Russian Reftinska-
ya coalfired power plant from the scope of consolidation,
due to its sale, on October 1, 2019.

Greenhouse gas emissions

Reduction of greenhouse gases is one of the priority targets
indicated in the environmental policy, pursued by gradual ex
pansion of renewable energy production and improvement
of infrastructure efficiency.

In particular, greenhouse gas emissions deriving from Enel's
industrial activities are mainly due to emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO,) from thermal generation and, more marginally,
to leakage of sulphur hexafluoride (SF,) from the distribu-
tion network. CO, specific emissions in 2019 amounted to?
296 g/kWh,, in line with the target certified by the Science
Based Targets initiative which the Group had set for 2030.

change”

SO,, NO, and dust

[033] [305-7]

 

Particular focus is placed on the emissions of the main air
borne pollutants associated with thermal generation: sul-
phur dioxides (SO,), nitrogen oxides (NO,) and dust. For

2 Value related only to consolidated production. In relation to the overall value
of the capacity managed, CO, emissions amount to 284 g/kWh,,,

Environmental sustainability

this purpose, in 2019, works on specific thermal generation
plants, mainly coal-fuelled plants, worth a total of 145 million
euros, were carried out, in addition to the establishment of a
187 million euros three-year investment plan for 2020-2022.
The choice of the most suitable work to improve the environ-
mental performance for each plant is based on an analysis
that, starting from the best technologies and international
practices, takes into account factors such as: the local con-
text and priorities, the plant operating methods, meaning the
hours of operation each year, the current plant engineering
configuration and the outlook for its productive life.
Emission measurements are carried out in compliance with
each country's regulatory framework and, in the majority of
the large plants, a measurement system is used that can
assess compliance with the limits in real time. Its reliability
is guaranteed by accredited certifying entities and through
assessments carried out by inspection authorities.

2019, compared to 2018, saw a fall in emissions, for all the
main pollutants both in absolute and specific terms. These
reductions are ascribable both to lower production from fos-
sil fuels, particularly coal, and to the implementation of effi-
ciency measures.

In particular, SO, specific emissions were equal to 0.59 g/
kWh,, (21% vs 2018), those of NO, were 0.60 g/kWh,,
(17% vs 2018) and those of dust were 0.12 g/kWh,, (29%
vs 2018)*. The drop in dust is mainly linked to the reduced pro-
duction from coal sources recorded during the year‘. Enel, in
relation to the values in 2010, sets its targets of atmospheric
emissions reduction, to be achieved by 2020, which are based
on the Industrial Plan and the plans for the installation or for
the upgrading of abatement systems. These targets were
achieved a year in advance for specific SO, and dust values,
whereas, for NO, emissions, these will be achieved by 2020.
The Group, furthermore, in relation to the values in 2017
set further emissions reduction targets specifically related
to atmospheric pollutants by 2030. Targets and reductions
trend are in line with the recognised “science-based” target,
set by the SBTi, to achieve specific CO, emission values
below 125 g/kWh,,.

3 Compared to the base year 2010, SO, emissions have dropped by 39%,
NO, by 29% and dust by 79%.

4 The emissions from the Retfinskaya coal plant in Russia contributed
significantly to this, as these emissions were accounted only for a nine-
month period following the exit of the plant, for sale, from the scope of
consolidation.
