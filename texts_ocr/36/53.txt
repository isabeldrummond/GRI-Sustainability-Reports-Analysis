of heating days (HDs), i.e. days with a temperature below
15 °C, and cooling days (CDs), or days with a temperature
above 24 °C, the 2030-2050 period will see HDs decrease
by 14% and CDs increase by 60% in the RCP 2.6 scenario,
while the RCP 8.5 scenario will see a larger decline in HDs
(17%) and a larger increase in CDs (+80%).

Acute phenomena: over the 2030-2050 period, heat
waves are expected to increase appreciably in frequen-
cy, with their geographical spread expected to expand,
especially in the southern area of the country. Extreme
rainfall will increase in intensity but their frequency will
decline. At the same time, extreme snowfalls will largely
remain located in the current geographical areas but their
frequency and intensity could decline sharply.

Chronic phenomena: the average annual temperature is
expected to increase over the 2030-2050 period in both
the RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios. In the RCP 8.5 scenario,
the temperature is expected to rise by an average of 0.4
°C compared with the RCP 2.6 scenario in the 2030-2050
period, with the differential then widening significantly in
the second half of the century. In terms of heating days
(HDs) and cooling days (CDs) the 2030-2050 period will
see HDs decrease by 6% and CDs increase by 29% in the
RCP 2.6 scenario, while the RCP 8.5 scenario will see a
larger decline in HDs (-10%) and a larger increase in CDs
(443%).

The transition scenario

The transition scenario depicts the evolution of industrial
and business sectors in an economic, social and regulato-
ry context consistent with different trends in greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions and, therefore, is correlated with the
RCP 2.6 and 8.5 climate scenarios. The Group has therefore
equipped itself with quantitative tools that incorporate as-
sumptions regarding the context to produce corresponding
projections for energy demand, electricity demand, electric-
ity production, the penetration of renewables and electric
vehicles, etc.: in short, all the variables that characterize a
national energy system relevant to the Group's activities.
In defining the transition scenarios, we distinguish between:
+ assumptions concerning the global macroeconomic and
energy context in terms of commodity prices, interest
rates, gross domestic product, etc., using international
benchmarks produced by entities such as the Interna-
tional Energy Agency (IEA), Bloomberg New Energy
Finance (BNEF), International Institute for Applied
Systems Analysis (IIASA), etc. As regards IIASA, for
example, consideration was given to the fundamentals
driving the “Shared Socioeconomic Pathways” (SSPs),
in which general energy scenarios related to physical cli-
matic scenarios are developed. The information deriving
from the “SSPs” is used to support long-term forecasts
on commodity prices;
> assumptions concerning local policies and regulato-
ry measures associated with the fight against climate
change, such as the reduction of carbon dioxide emis-
