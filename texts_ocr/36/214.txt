The Enel Group's corporate governance reference model — based on the parent company’s corporate governance
system, on the corporate governance Recommendations of the Enel Group's listed companies, as well as on
several international best practices relating to the composition and functioning of the Board of Directors (“Board”)
— is structured into the following 10 principles:

The Board: consideration of the interests of all stakeholders and not only those of shareholders; long-term
vision and shared understanding of the corporate culture and its purpose; a clear distinction of roles between the
administrative board and top management; deep understanding of the company’s business and reference market;
positive atmosphere, trust and a working environment based on listening.

Board Composi
the ideal size of the Board varies from 7 to 11 members, based on the committees to be set up; sufficient diversity
of gender, geographic origin, age and tenure; appropriate presence of truly independent directors, over and above

 

in: an appropriate board composition that brings out synergy of individual skills and experience;

compliance with formal criteria, which is especially key in the case of companies subject to management and
coordination; adequate time availability of directors in line with an ad hoc policy on the maximum number of other
offices they may hold.

Induction and Education: implementation of an onboarding programme for newly appointed directors, together
with systematic training plans over the course of their term, addressing strategic, business, risk management, legal
and sustainability issues.

Board Leadership: the key role of the Chair in managing the functioning of the Board, ensuring the conscious and
active participation of each member in the proceedings; separation of the roles of Chair and CEO, ensuring that
their respective responsibilities are complementary and do not overlap; presence of a Senior Independent Director
where necessary.

Succession Planning: to safeguard the company's continuity, the Board oversees contingency plans to ensure
the roles of Chair and CEO are suitably and continually held; verification of the presence and effectiveness of top
management's succession plans.

Board Committees: through their preliminary, proactive and consultative activities on various delicate issues,
the Committees provide key support to the Board's activity, without prejudice to the Board’s decision-making
prerogatives on these subjects; opportunities for a broad presence of independent directors in committees; clear
division of roles between the committees and effective communication between them and the Board; progressive
focus of a committee on sustainability issues.

Managing the meetings: at least 9 formal Board meetings per year, supplemented — where possible — with informal
meetings between directors; proper balancing between comprehensive Board documentation and summaries of
the main topics, with appropriate advance notice given to directors; participation of firsttine management in relation
to the issues addressed.

“When things go wrong”: mapping of potential, exogenous or endogenous, crisis situations, assessing the risks
involved and preparing mitigation measures. In the event of actual crisis situations, fast proportionate and reactive
interventions accompanied by communicative transparency in relation to their content.

Measuring performance: systematic measurement of the Board's performance as a whole and each individual
director's contribution; aligning the compensation of non-executive directors with the actual commitment
required.

Beyond the Boardroom: clear communication of specific commitments on sustainability issues; transparent and
timely reporting on the results achieved. Alignment of the Board culture with the company's strategy. Enel's strategy
based on the creation of sustainable value in the long term, taking into account the interests of various stakeholder,
integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors across the whole value chain.
