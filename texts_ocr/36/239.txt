progress towards them in order to provide full disclosure of all
significant information during the reporting period and reliable es-
timates for the future. With regard to the quality of the informa-
tion reported, the principles of balance, comparability, accuracy,
timeliness, clarity and reliability have been observed.

This Report is also compliant with the principles of inclusivity,
materiality and responsiveness set out in AA1000APS (Ac-
countAbility Principles Standard) issued in 2008 by AccountA-
bility, an international applied research institution focusing on
sustainability issues. With regard to the materiality principle,
in particular, the depth in which the various subjects are dis-

cussed in the Report has been determined according to their
weight in the Group's goals and strategies and their relevance
for stakeholders, identified through a structured materiality ana+
ysis process.

Finally, a reference to the United Nations SDGs has been includ-
ed in the various chapters, in accordance with the instructions
provided in the SDG Compass, the guide published in November
2015, developed by GRI, the UN Global Compact and the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development ("WBCSD") to
support companies in aligning their strategies with the SDGs
and measuring and managing their contributions to these goals.
