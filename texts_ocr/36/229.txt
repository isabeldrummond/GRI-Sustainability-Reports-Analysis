Respect

Enel performs a specific human rights due diligence process
on the entire value chain in the various countries where it op-
erates. Specifically, the process was developed in line with
best international practices and includes four phases:

MAIN RESULTS 2017-2019

 

Analysis of tisk perceived by key stakeholders, at individual country
level, with regard to labour rights, local community rights and envi-
ronment rights

The analysis showed that issues relating to bribery and environmental im-
pacts are a “high priority risk” assessment, that requires companies to
adopt advanced monitoring and management mechanisms.

 

Gap assessment to identify and analyse organisational and risk con-
trol systems

The policies, procedures, systems and practices in place in the Group in
each area of the value chain have been assessed by analysing over 100
indicators. The results showed that Enel has a set of robust mechanisms
and management systems, which ensure respect for human rights and
adequately manage existing risks.

 

Development of improvement plans

Around 160 actions have been planned, covering 100% of operations and
sites.

 

Monitoring improvement plans

Atthe end of 2019, over 90% of actions were completed. For the remain-
ing 10% approximately, some actions will be completed in 2020 as part
of larger processes or due to extemal factors (such as the social crisis in
Chile), while others have been removed as they are no longer necessary
following organisational changes.
