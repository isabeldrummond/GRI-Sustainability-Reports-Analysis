(1) Indicative value in euros (EUR), although the investmentin US dollars (USD) applies where present. The exchange rate used for projects allocated in the 2017 green
bond is 1.11 USD/EUR, for projects allocated in the 2018 green bond is 1.19 USD/EUR whereas for projects whose investment value has been updated — including
those with the new Capex identified in GB 2019 — the exchange rate is 1.21

(2) Additional proceeds were allocated for some renewable projects that were already.

(3) Aggregate data related to 8 small sized Italian projects. The concerned technology is hydroelectric.

n.a. not applicable

(1) For projects for which new Capex were allocated in 2019, in addition to what was allocated in the 2017 and 2018 green bond, for the ESG indicators refer to the 2017
and 2018 tables.

(2) For projects entered into operation by September 30, 2019, the actual production data are reported and consequently the amount of CO, avoided.

(3) For projects entered into operation after September 30, 2019 or which have not yet entered into operation, the expected annual production data and the expected
amount of CO, avoided are reported.
The share of production for only repowering cannot be separated from the rest of the plant because it is not possible to precisely determine the share of energy fed
to the network only due to the increase in power.

(4) Aggregate data related to 8 small sized Italian projects. The concerned technology is hydroelectric.
