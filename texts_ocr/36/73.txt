 

In 2019, Enel played a fundamental role in developing new,
solutions to accelerate the process of energy transition
through the development of 110 MW of storage capacity,
corresponding to a growth of 57.1% in comparison to 2018,
and 6.3 GW of demand response, 1.3% higher than 2018.
The digitalization of the electricity network, which has been
identified as a key enabler able to positively influence cli-
mate change through levers such as the integration of more
renewable energy or an increase in energy efficiency, con-
tinued being a priority for Enel also in 2019. In particular, in
2019 the total number of end users with active smart me-
ters grew 2% as compared to the previous year, reaching
44.7 million in 2019.

 

Enel has also continued defining solutions for promoting the de-
carbonization of other sectors, such as transport. The Company
is in fact committed to developing electric mobility initiatives
and promoting sustainable transport, installing 79,565 charging
points in 2019, a 62.5% increase in comparison to 2018.

Environmental metrics related
to climate change

The following table presents the environmental metrics re-
lated to climate change, in addition to the greenhouse gas
emissions previously described in the dedicated paragraph
of this chapter.

Following Enel's adoption of the new GRI 303 in 2018, requirements refer to the total amount of water withdrawn, including reuse of wastewater, necessary for

plant operation. The specific requirement for total generation is calculated considering the total water consumption for thermoelectric and nuclear generation,
compared to total thermoelectric (including the heat contribution in MWh), renewable and nuclear generation. This value does not include the water used for
open-cycle cooling, which is retumed to the original body of water. Consumption is calculated as the difference between the water withdrawn and the water

returned.

The World Resources Institute (WRI) has defined a “Water Stressed Area” as an area where the annual amount of water available per capitais less than 1,700 m*.
