Listening and dialogue

 

One important listening tool in the Company is the climate
survey, which makes it possible to identify areas of improve-
ment in relation to three key topics — well-being, engage-
ment, and safety — and suggestions on topics and aspects of
working life. Following the 2018 survey the identified action
plans are currently under development. To answer the is-
sues that emerged from the climate survey concerning work-
life balance and well-being, a process of in-depth analysis of
the digital detox topic was launched in 2019. Further to anal-
ysis of studies and research into the impacts of hyperconnec-
tivity, a set of actions was defined, also with the participation
of Enel people in dedicated focus groups, in order to facilitate
the transition from a hyperconnectivity culture to a culture of
responsible use of electronic devices.

Another key tool for feedback and proximity to people con-
sists of interviews with People Business Partners, corpo-
rate figures dedicated to listening and identifying the needs
of people in order to integrate them with the needs of the
organisation. These figures are assisted by People Support
Points, i.e. physical meeting points to which people can refer
to resolve administrative and operative topics associated with
their employment relationship. Planning is also proceeding for
the People & Business Partner network and support services
to facilitate the management of the personal and professional
daily life of employees suffering from chronic illnesses. The
initiative constitutes an important phase of attention to an ex-
tremely delicate topic and is aimed at promoting the profes-
sional and social inclusion of all people.

Internal communication

Enel considers internal communications to be an impor-
tant support in creating the corporate culture and in both
organisational and people growth, soliciting and promoting
the exchange of information, know-how and experience.
Several global campaigns were promoted in 2019, including
the launch of Enel People, a new section of the website
www.enel.com dedicated to employer branding and talent
acquisition. The existing platform has been completely rein-
vented and an interactive journey has been recreated, mak-
ing it possible to explore life in the organisation and get an
idea of the environment in which Enel people work all over
the world, listening directly to their opinions in relation to
innovation, sustainability and technology, and also in relation
to their personal experience in the Company. In addition to
collecting all open positions in the various Group countries,
the section provides a storytelling function relating the enor-
mous diversity and wealth of experience of Enel people.
Internal communication is also the main vector to dissem-
inate Enel's strategy and the objectives identified for the
near future. In 2019, Enel's internal media were further de-
veloped in order to guarantee that the contents reach the
entire population of the Company in all its Countries and Re-
gions, and that they are accessible also from mobile termi-
nals and outside the company network.

Enel's commitment to diversity and inclusion is a process that
began in 2013 with the adoption of the Policy on Human
Rights, followed in 2015 by the “Diversity and inclusion”
Policy, in parallel with adoption of the seven “Women’s Em-
powerment Principles” (WEP) promoted by the UN Glob-
al Compact and UN Women and in compliance with the UN
Sustainable Development Goals.

Moreover, the Global People Care and Diversity Manage-

Our people and their value

ment unit was set up in 2016 within the People and Organ-
ization Function, where it performs the role of guiding and
supervising adoption of the policy, also by monitoring a de-
tailed set of internal indicators linked to the various actions
and areas of application.

2019 saw the publication of the workplace harassment pol-
icy, the aim of which is to disseminate a culture of opposi-
tion to all forms of harassment in the workplace and offer
