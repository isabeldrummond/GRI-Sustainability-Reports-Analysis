of documents, recalculation, agreeing or reconciling with underlying records and other evidence-
gathering procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

Our limited assurance engagement also includes:

(i) meeting with Enel's personnel involved in the preparation of the Green Bond Report;

(ii) assessing, through inquiries with Enel's personnel, the procedures followed to collect,
aggregate and report the financial indicators and the ESG indicators included in the Green
Bond Report;

(iii) performing limited test of details to verify that the data used in the preparation of the Green
Bond Report are consistent with the information and documentation held by the companies
of the Enel Group.

A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance
engagement conducted in accordance with ISAE 3000 revised and consequently does not enable us
to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
a reasonable assurance engagement.

Conclusion

Based on the procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that the Company's Green Bond Report attached to the Sustainability Report 2019 is not
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria described in the “Reporting criteria”
note.

Basis for preparation

Without modifying our conclusion, we draw attention to “Reporting criteria” note to the Green Bond
Report, which describe the basis for preparation. The Green Bond Report is prepared for the
purposes described in the first paragraph. As a result, the Green Bond Report may not be suitable for
another purpose.
