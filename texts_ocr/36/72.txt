At the end of December 2019, the Group's total net effi-
cient installed capacity was 84.3 GW, down 1.3 GW from
2018, mainly due to the sale of the Reftinskaya coal-fired
power plant in Russia. This reduction was partially offset by
the entry into operation of new renewable plants, mainly
wind and solar in Spain, Mexico and the United States.

In order to contribute towards the decarbonization of
its energy mix, in 2019 Enel increased its renewable in-

stalled capacity by 3.6 GW, while reducing its coal capac-
ity by 4.1 GW. As a result, installed capacity from zero
emissions sources has reached 53.9% (50.0% consid-
ering only renewable sources) of Enel's total installed
capacity in 2019, whereas it is equal to 55.8% (52.0%
considering only renewable sources) when including ad-
ditional capacity managed according to the “Build, Sell
and Operate” model.
