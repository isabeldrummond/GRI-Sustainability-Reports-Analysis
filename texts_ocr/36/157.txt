chain

Enel’s purchasing processes are based on pre-contractual and contractual conduct
geared towards loyalty, transparency and collaboration. In addition to ensuring the
necessary quality standards, supplier performance must go hand in hand with the
commitment to adopt best practices in terms of human rights, working conditions,
occupational health and safety, and environmental responsibility. The Code of Eth-
ics, Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan, Policy on Human Rights, Model pursuant to
Legislative Decree 231/01 and Enel Global Compliance Program underpin its pur-
chasing activities and serve as a guide and code of conduct for suppliers.
