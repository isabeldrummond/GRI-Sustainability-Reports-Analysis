Thanks to the strategies implemented in the field, the Group
could achieve an ordinary low-carbon EBITDA of 18.3 billion
euros in 2022 that will bring the contribution of products,
services and technologies with low-carbon emissions to
91% of the total ordinary EBITDA. During the period of the
Plan, in compliance with the objectives of EBITDA, more
than 90% of Capex will be destined to products, services
and technologies with low-carbon emissions.

capacity should increase from 35% in 2018 to 69% in 2040
thanks to the progressive decline in generation costs and to the
increased public awareness of climate issues. This evolution of
the system towards more variable sources will require greater
flexibility to manage the balance between generation and con-
sumption. Accordingly, demand response and storage technol-
ogies are also expected to grow significantly, also in this case
boosted by a steep decline in costs, which are expected to
halve over the next 20 years.

The major decarbonization objectives of plan will therefore be
achieved thanks to an acceleration of renewables development
as Well as the progressive decommissioning of coal-fired
plants. The objective is to achieve an entirely marginal level of
coal generation by 2030, with a 74% decrease in production
by 2022.
