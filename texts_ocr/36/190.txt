El Quimbo - restocking of juvenile fish

The hydroelectric power plant of El Quimbo continues to invest in its commitments undertaken to benefit local communities.
Traditional artisanal fishing is one of the production activities on the Rio Magdalena. During the construction of the power
plant, people involved in this activity have been identified, and a programme to manage both the water and fishing resources.
was developed.

The outcome of this programme in 2019 saw the introduction of 200,000 juvenile capavin, with Enel initiating the re-stocking
of the Magdalena river to relaunch fishing activities for the inhabitants of the El Quimbo basin.

This project involved over 10 years of research to come to fruition, selecting and sourcing the juvenile fish now distributed
across El Quimbo today. This was the first project authorised in June 2019 by the National Aquaculture and Fishery Authorities
(Autoridad Nacional de Acuicultura y Pesca - AUNAP) to introduce native species into the upper basin of the Magdalena river
at the El Quimbo dam. Hence a project with enormous social impact for approximately 200 fishermen from Puerto Seco to
La Jagua was launched.

To date, a total of 320,000 juvenile bocachico have repopulated the areas in the Municipalities of Garzon, Gigante and Yaguara
of the Huila department, which will total 800,000 fish of the golden species including bocachico, peje and patalo, by 2020.

Enel X: e-mobility

Testament to the extensive commitment to sustainable mobil
ty through the electrification of the circulating vehicles and the
resulting savings of CO, emissions, Enel X has designed the
emobility Emission Saving tool, using a specific algorithm to
calculate the amounts of CO, saved when an electric or electri
fied vehicle is used compared to a traditional endothermic en-
gine. The e-mobility Emission Saving tool is the first algorithm
validated by an intemationally-recognised certification autho-
rity (RINA) for this very purpose. January 2018 to December
2019 saw over 800,000 recharges at Enel X stations across
Italy; approximately 10 mil of kWh energy was delivered by the
charging stations and electrical vehicle drivers travelled approxi
mately 59 mil km. The kWh distributed from the recharging
stations are regularly calculated by the EMM system (Electro
Mobility Management Platform), the Enel X digital platform that
continuously manages information related to the recharging of
electric vehicles across Italy, accessible to both public and prt
