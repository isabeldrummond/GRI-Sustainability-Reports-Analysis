Integrity requirements

Tender and contracting
processes

In 2019, more than 5,000 tenders were launched, approxi-

mately 4,000 of which were online. In particular, the online

negotiations made it possible to avoid printing more than 1

million pages, reducing the environmental impact of these

activities.

Enel has pursued its commitment to introducing sustainabili-

ty requirements into the tender process by adopting a specif-

ic “sustainability K factor’ It has continued to integrate the

so-called “Library” which lists the “sustainability Ks” to be

used in tender processes by the different purchasing units in

line with the various MCs. There are three main categories

in particular:

+> environmental Ks: for example, with the ISO 14001
certification, waste management, carbon footprint as-
sessment according to UNI EN ISO 14067:2018; circular
economy projects;

> safety Ks: for example, having the OHSAS 18001 certifi-
cation, monitoring the main safety indexes;

+> social Ks: for example, hiring staff in a state of unem-
ployment/redundancy/mobility or young first-time job-
seekers, or conducting social projects.

Since 2016, new operating practices have been established and adopted at Group level in terms of checks on sup-

pliers’

integrity requirements” with the aim of consolidating the existing control system through more rigorous

action to tackle corruption, particularly by: setting out specific documentary check criteria for legal and integrity requi-
rements that are homogeneous and applicable to the procurement process (from the assessment phase through to
awarding individual contracts); identifying the operating modes for checks to enhance the preventive tools available
and have a rational, organic and determined impact on any cases of corruption or on factors contributing to its spread;
promoting a widespread culture of compliance and ethics. An Artificial Intelligence System was later integrated into
the system as a tool to analyse and mitigate reputational, environmental and social risks, etc. in order to select and

constantly monitor suppliers by checking open sources.
