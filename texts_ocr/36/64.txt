Market

— Market dynamics, such as those connected with
the variability of commodity prices, the increase in
electricity consumption due to the energy transition
and the penetration of renewables, have an impact

on business drivers, with effects on margins and on

electricity generation and sales volumes.

> Opportunities: positive effects associated with
the growth in electricity demand and the greater
room for renewables and all sources of flexibility.

> Risks: less room in the market for residual ther-
mal generation technologies in the short term.
However, as the penetration of renewables in
the electricity mix increases, the system could
require greater flexibility, including regulated gas-
fired generation

Technology
+ Gradual penetration of new technologies such as
storage and demand response; digital lever to transform
operating models and “platform” business models.
> Opportunities: investments in developing technol-
ogy solutions.

Products and Services

> Electrification of residential energy consumption:
With the gradual electrification of end uses, the pen-
etration of products with lower costs and a smaller
impact in terms of residential emissions will expand
(for example, the use of heat pumps for heating and
cooling).

Commitment to the fight a

 

st climate change

 

 

> Opportunities: increase in electricity consump-
tion.

> Risks: additional competition in this market seg-
ment.

+ Electric mobility and electrification of industri-
al energy consumption: Use of more efficient and
effective modes of transportation from the point of
view of climate change, with a special focus on the
development of electric mobility and charging infra-
structure; electrification of large-scale industrial ener-
gy users.
> Opportunities: Positive effects of the increase in

electricity demand and greater margins connect-
ed with the penetration of electric transportation

The Group has already taken strategic actions to mitigate
potential risks and exploit the opportunities offered by
the energy transition. Thanks to our industrial and finan-
cial strategy incorporating ESG factors, an integrated ap-
proach shaped by sustainability and innovation makes it
possible to create shared long-term value.
A strategy focused on complete decarbonization and the
energy transition makes the Group resilient to the risks as-
sociated with the introduction of more ambitious policies
for emissions reductions and maximises opportunities for
the development of renewable generation, infrastructure
and enabling technologies.

Unlike chronic climate impacts, developments in the tran-

sition scenario could have impacts in the short and medi-

um term (by 2030) as well.

As with climate variables, the current Business Plan

(2020-2022) can be tested for its sensitivity to the fac-
