The transformation underway leads to
structural changes in various industrial
sectors, leading to the opening up of new.
markets and business opportunities, but
also to the need to renew consolidated
models and rethink the ways that availa-
ble resources are being used. The results
achieved by Enel in recent years attest
to the soundness and sustainability
of a business model that is capable
of creating value for all stakeholders
and supporting the accomplishment
of the UN Sustainable Development
Goals. 2019 was a key year in relation
to the decarbonization strategy, with
the construction of over 3,000 MW of
renewable capacity, the continuation of
the coal power plants decommissioning
plan, generation from renewable sourc-
es surpassing the output from thermal
generation, and specific CO, emissions
from total net production totalling 296
g/kWh,,. The new Global Power Gen-
eration Business Line, which integrates
renewable capacity with thermal gen-
eration, was created to further support
and accelerate this process. Users with
smart meters number 44.7 million, and
the Group has a total of 70 million end
users, thus confirming Enel's positive
positioning, especially in developed
countries in which a process of ener-
gy markets liberalisation is in progress.
Company people, totalling 68,253 in the
various Group countries and regions,
constitute the strategic lever to manage
the energy transition process. Our staff
are offered specific upskilling and reskill-
ing programmes as well as tailored train-
ing initiatives are offered to Enel people
to boost digital skills. The combined in-
juries frequency rate (Enel people and
contractors) confirmed the downward
trend of prior years (0.73 in 2019 vs 0.90
in 2018). Projects with local communities
remained in place, aimed at promoting
access to energy, high-quality educa-
tion, and socio-economic development.

Important results were achieved also
in terms of environmental sustainability
and in the sphere of vendor relations.
Finally, the principles of innovation, dig-
italization and the circular economy were
infused throughout all processes in the
value chain.

Thanks to the Group's diversification of
countries and regions, the integrated
business model throughout the value
chain, a solid financial structure, and the
level of digitalization achieved, Enel guar-
antees the continuity of its operating as-
sets with the same level of service, in
relation to the emergency caused by the
spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19), also in
support of the countries in which it oper-
ates. Smart working was rapidly imple-
mented for around 50% of Enel people,
protecting health and guaranteeing busi
ness continuity, anda dedicated task force
has been set up to monitor the phenom-
ena, determine any appropriate actions,
and share its experience gained with the
various countries. To accommodate work
requirements and assist smart working
staff with their remote collaboration, a
daily contents bulletin has been set up on
the Enel intranet with coaching “pills”, ad-
vice and recommendations on how to use
the IT tools and resources to their best ad-
vantage, plus tutorials dedicated to health
of individuals and their families. From the
operational standpoint, the majority of as-
sets are digitalized and are remote control
compatible, as are customer operations
and communication channels. This digi-
talization process, which started in 2015,
now means that Enel’s people and assets
are perfectly positioned to face with the
current global crisis.

By exploiting synergies between the
various business areas, taking actions by
leveraging innovation, and implementing
Open Power behaviours, the Enel Group
seeks solutions to reduce environmental

 

impact and meet the requirements of
customers and the local communities in
which it operates, with a commitment
to guaranteeing high safety standards
for employees and vendors alike. Enel is
thus able to take on the new challenges
of the energy transition process, not sim-
ply by reacting to risks, but by embracing
all the opportunities without leaving an-
yone behind. A clear, defined and long-
term strategic vision, and day-to-day ac-
tions based on the concept of openness
and the inviolable synthesis between
innovation and sustainability. Inner and
outer openness towards the interior and
towards the exterior is achieved through
the creation of innovative and cross-sec-
tor partnerships that call for the develop-
ment of new modes of engagement to
guarantee a lasting relationship and firm
positioning in an increasingly unstruc-
tured scenario. This approach will lead to
the interception and interpretation of the
faint signals today that will become the
trends of tomorrow.

Akey element of the outlined approach is
the adoption of ESG (Environmental, So-
cial and Governance) sustainability indi-
cators throughout the entire value chain,
not merely for the assessment of the re-
sults achieved, but above all to anticipate
decisions and develop a proactive out-
look. Enel has an ongoing commitment
to the management and measurement
of its performance in terms of all relevant
aspects, addressing economic, business
and ESG issues in reporting its operations
and defining the objectives underpinning
its strategy. This model is fully in line with
the requirements of the UN Global Com-
pact — of which Enel has been an active
member since 2004 — which stress the
importance of ever-increasing integration
of sustainability throughout all corporate
strategies. The Enel Chief Executive Of-
ficer is a member of the Global Compact
Board of Directors.
