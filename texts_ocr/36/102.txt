review policy contains specific guidelines to take account of
diversity issues, which are also among the criteria employed
to identify talent to insert in succession plans (refer to the

A large number of activities were carried out dedicated to em-
powerment and the development of female leadership in the
countries in which the Group operates, and the path aimed at
facilitating access by female students to technical faculties
(Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - STEM)
continued to be pursued by means of awareness initiatives,
carried out in schools, in universities, and in company sites.

In relation to parenthood, there are specific paternity and ma-
ternity programmes in place. Many countries are implement-
ing improvement measures with respect to local legislation
in relation to maternity, paternity and parental leave. With
respect to legal requirements, extra days of maternity leave
are granted, together with supplementary remuneration, in
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Italy, Mexico,
United States, and Spain. For example, in Italy Enel pays
100% of the normal salary in the first 5 months, compared

 

to the legal requirement of 80%. Also, Colombia offers the
opportunity of smart working in the last month of pregnancy,
while in Argentina smart working is possible for two days per
week in the first six months after returning from maternity
leave and, in India, to support critical situations during preg-
nancy. Paternity leave is guaranteed by law in many countries,
and in the majority of them Enel provides additional days of
paid leave. For example, in Italy, five further days of paid leave
are provided in addition to the five days required by law for
2019. Conversely, in relation to paternity leave, Enel's collec-
tive bargaining agreement in Italy provides for remuneration
equivalent to 45% for the first month and 40% for the second
and third months, while the legal requirement is 30% for the
first six months. On the other hand, Russia, Romania, Greece
and Panama recognise a monetary contribution on the birth of
a child, while in South Africa the full salary is paid during the
period of leave that is not remunerated under local legislation.
Active on the global level, the Parental Program project is
aimed at promoting organisational and personal awareness
of the value of parenthood in order to assure optimal recon-
ciliation of personal and professional needs concerning this
