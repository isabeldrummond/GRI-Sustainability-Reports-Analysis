 

action”. Therefore it is committed to developing a business
model in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement to
maintain the average increase of the global temperature
below 2 °C compared with pre-industrial levels and to con-
tinue to limit the increase to 1.5 °C. In 2019, the Group re-
affirmed this commitment once again by responding to the
call to action from the United Nations, being the first Italian
company that signed the pledge to limit the rise in global
temperatures to 1.5 °C and to achieving zero emissions
by 2050. Enel also pledged to set interim quantitative tar-
gets in line with the criteria of the Science Based Targets
initiative (SBTi), by which a new target of 70% reduction in
its own direct greenhouse gas emissions per kWh,, by
2030, as compared with 2017 base year, was announced in
September 2019.

Particular attention is placed on the climate change ad-
aptation policies in order to increase the resilience of the
assets along the entire value change, thereby limiting po-
tentially negative impacts and guaranteeing a safe and sus-
tainable energy service in all the countries where the Group
operates.

In order to guarantee increased transparency in its commu-
nications and relationships with its stakeholders, Enel peri-
odically reports on its related activities in line with the inter-
national standards of the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative)
and is publicly committed to adopting the recommenda-
tions of the Task force on Climate-related Financial Dis-
closures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board, which

 

Commitment to the fight against climate change

in June 2017 published specific recommendations for the
voluntary reporting of the financial impact of climate risks.
The Group has also integrated the “Guidelines on report-
ing climate-related information” published by the Euro-
pean Commission in June 2019, taking into consideration
the results of the first work performed by the European Lab
Project Task Force on Climate-related Reporting (PTF CRR),
which collects the relative good practices (“How to improve
climate-related reporting”).

A zero emissions system in the second half of the current
century, as foreseen by the Paris Agreement, will require
significant technological, social and economic transfor-
mations. For this reason, the transition must also be just,
promoting the creation of sustainable and decent jobs.
Therefore the climate action must be accompanied by the
promotion of a just and inclusive transition and the crea-
tion of sustainable and decent jobs.

A just and inclusive
transition

Enel is convinced that decarbonization is an opportunity for
the entire society, but it is fundamental that the benefits of
energy transition are shared, accompanying it with wide-
scale measures that support climatic, energy, environmen-
tal, industrial and social aspects

Enel’s commitment

to the United Nations

In July 2019, Enel’s Chief Executive Officer signed the “just

transition” commitment promoted by the United Nations,

which commits the Company to guaranteeing that the new

jobs will be fair, decent and inclusive. Enel is committed to

respecting the following international standards both with-

in the company and having them respected by its suppliers:

> social dialogue with workers and their trade unions;

+> respect for worker rights (including those regarding
safety) on the basis of the requirements of the Interna-
tional Labour Organization - ILO;

> social protection, including pensions and health care;

+> salary guarantee, also those in line with the ILO direc-
tives.
