ANAGEMENT PROCEDL AND MITIGATION ACTIONS

 

 

Risks linked
to business
continuity

Enel may be exposed to the risk of judicial or administrative
sanctions, economic or financial losses, or reputational damage
as a result of a partial or total interruption of commercial oper
ations, technical failures, malfunctions of goods and plants, hu-
man errors, sabotage, unavailability of raw materials or adverse
weather events, or any emerging infectious diseases resulting
in a potential epidemic or pandemic that may impede the nor-
mal functioning of the Group's activities or supply chain.

Enel has systems and mechanisms to guarantee a continuous
and safe energy supply to the national electrical systems of
the countries in which it operates. Therefore, Enel is constantly
working to develop and improve the efficiency of the distribu-
tion network, in coordination with the other entities operat-
ing on the network infrastructure for various reasons. Enel is
carrying out maintenance on and modemising the network of
existing infrastructures in all countries, with the main aim of
reducing the number and duration of interruptions to service.
Enel is also constantly adopting operational efficiency and safe-
ty measures to ensure the correct functioning of all its power
plants. Lastly, the Group's assets are covered by adequate in-
surance mechanisms to protect the Company from potential
negative economic consequences resulting from future, uncer-
tain events.

Moreover, particularly in relation to the management of critical
events, Enel has drawn up a policy to ensure the effectiveness
of the decision-making process when managing any event that
could compromise the continuity of the public service and the
Company's activity, including global health emergencies.

Enel is implementing appropriate protocols, plans and actions
to ensure the smooth running of its economic activity all over
the world or— where necessary its rapid recovery in the event
of an interruption to service.

 

Risks
connected with
cyber attacks

The speed of technological developments that constantly
generate new challenges, the ever increasing frequency and
intensity of cyber attacks and the attraction of critical infrastruc-
tures and strategic industrial sectors as targets underscore the
potential risk that, in extreme cases, the normal operations of
companies could grind to a halt. Cyber attacks have evolved
dramatically in recent years: their number has grown exponen-
tially, as has their complexity and impact, making it increasingly
difficult to promptly identify the source of threats. In the case of
the Enel Group, this exposure reflects the many environments
in which it operates (data, industry and people), a circumstance
that accompanies the intrinsic complexity and interconnection
of the resources that over the years have been increasingly
integrated into the Group’s daily operating processes.

The Group has adopted a holistic governance approach to cy-
ber security that is applied to all the sectors of IT (Information
Technology), OT (Operational Technology) and loT (Internet of
Things). The framework is based on the commitment of top
management, on global strategic management, on the involve-
ment of all business areas as well as on the units involved in
the design and management of our systems. It seeks to use
cutting edge technologies, to design ad hoc business process-
es, to strengthen people's IT awareness and to implement reg-
ulatory requirements for IT security.

In addition, the Group has developed an IT risk management
methodology founded on “risk-based” and “cyber security by
design” approaches, making business risk analysis the funda-
mental step in all strategic decisions. Enel has also created its
own Cyber Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) in order to pro-
actively respond to any IT security incidents.

Finally, in 2019, the Group also took out an insurance policy for
cyber security risks in order to mitigate IT threats

Further information on how this risk is managed can be found
in the chapter “Innovation and digitalization’”
