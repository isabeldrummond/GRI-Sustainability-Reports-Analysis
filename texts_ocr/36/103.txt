critical stage of life. In this context, New Parents New En-
ergy is a training programme operating in Italy, designed to
elevate the value of parenting skills in the work context and to
support new parents in reconciling roles and managing their
daily lives. Also active is the MAAM-CHILD digital platform,
which stimulates active reflection on individual experience in
order to bring it to the table in a work-related setting and that
uses life and caring experiences as an opportunity for devel-
oping essential soft skills for effective work activities, namely
organisational, innovative and relational capabilities. Finally,
various awareness initiatives were carried out on the subject
of violence against women.

As a testament to the commitment concerning the topic of
gender equality, for the first time this year Enel was included
in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index (GEl). The Group is
in fact one of the 325 companies of the approximately 6 thou-
sand businesses listed on the stock exchange in 84 countries
assessed based on the degree of dissemination and success
of their inclusion initiatives. Also Enel's Spanish subsidiary
Endesa was included in the index for the first time. The recog-
nition is due to the practices aimed at promoting the presence
of women on the Board of Directors, in managerial positions
and among new recruits, helping to guarantee equal remu-
neration and social benefits and work-life balance solutions
for all employees.

Age diversity

The tutorship programmes proceeded in 2019 for new junior
recruits, in order to support their induction into Enel. There
are also knowledge transfer programmes in place where
each Country and Business Line identifies the most suitable
methods to facilitate intergenerational exchanges, involving
both senior (mainly on technical topics) and junior (mainly on
digital skills) Enel people as internal coaches or experts. In
2019, around 1,100 seniors shared their know-how with more
than 12 thousand co-workers, and around 300 juniors did the
same with more than 7 thousand co-workers. Furthermore,
on the global level, a programme of manager to manager
and manager to upcoming juniors “Job Shadowing” was
launched, aimed at facilitating the exchange of Open Power
competences, managerial styles, values and approaches, in
order to promote mobility and dissemination of knowledge
and to consolidate the professional network. New recruits are
also assigned a tutor as an informal point of reference for

102

professional development, to help them get to know the or-
ganisation and the value system.

The tutorship is currently part of the onboarding process,
which also envisages a global training project dedicated to
graduates between 22 and 28 years of age from all over the
world. The project promotes the Open Power culture and
makes participants Open Power ambassadors in their coun-
tries of origin. In this context, the promotion and development
of new skills has been assured by setting up “Click Labora-
tories”, innovation centres addressed to young new recruits
with the aim of developing cross-sector and knowledge inte-
grated with digital competences and soft skills.

Disabilities

 

There are 2,254 people with disabilities in Enel, of whom
around 1,700 in Italy. Specific statutory legislation in many of
Enel's countries calls for minimum numbers of disabled staff
in the workforce, and all countries in the Group were found
to be in line with the related provisions. In each of the rele-
vant countries® there is a reference focal point dedicated to
identifying needs and promoting initiatives aimed at assuring
the inclusion of people with disabilities. In consideration of
the large number of disabled staff in Italy, 2 focal points were
created. Including diversities also means providing people
with tools, services and working methods to allow them to
perform their duties in a fully independent manner. In Italy,
several initiatives within the “Avanti tutti” project have been
adopted, aimed at delivering tools to make processes and en-
vironments inclusive and to promote autonomy, making life in
the organisational context more simple and productive. Exam-
ples include Pedius for safety, the app that allows the hearing
impaired to receive and make telephone calls thanks to a voice
synthesis system integrated with safety functions, company
guidelines for accessibility to web contents and a large range
of specific training initiatives. In Spain, a personalised coun-
selling and Plan Familia service is active for Enel people with
disabled family members, in addition to the Company's volun-
tary activities aimed at the employability of disabled persons
at risk of social exclusion. In addition, various communication
campaigns have been launched to promote awareness on the
importance of the inclusion of people with disabilities through
the use of virtual reality tools, workshops and interviews.

5 Relevant countries are those in which there is at least one disabled mem-
ber of staff.
