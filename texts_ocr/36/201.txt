1 In line with the Global Reporting Initiative, the 9 members of the Board of
Directors all belong to the over 50 age group.

With regard to succession plans for executive directors, in
September 2016, the Board of Directors — upon the proposal
of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, together
with the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Commit-
tee — shared the contents of a specific “contingency plan”
aimed at regulating the steps to be taken to ensure the
Company's proper management in the event that the Chief
Executive Officer ceases to hold office before the end of his/
her ordinary term (so-called “crisis management” case).

In January 2018, the Board of Directors, upon the proposal
of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee
and of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, in im-
plementation of the provisions of the Italian Consolidated
Financial Act, approved a Diversity Policy, which describes
the optimal features of the composition of the Board itself,
in order for it to exercise its functions in the most effective
way, taking decisions with the contribution of multiple quali-

200

fied viewpoints to examine the issues being discussed from
different perspectives.

Towards the end of financial year 2019 and during the first
two months of 2020, the Board of Directors carried out —
with the assistance of a specialised consultancy firm — an
evaluation of the size, composition and functioning of the
Board itself and its committees (“board review"), in line
with the most advanced corporate governance practices
followed abroad and adopted under the Corporate Govern-
ance Code. The assessment was carried out according to
the “peerto-peer review” method, i.e. by evaluating not only
the functioning of the body as a whole, but also the style
and content of the contribution made by each director. As
part of this board review, the questionnaires and interviews
regarded — among other things — the adoption of sustain-
ability principles into the Company and Group's strategies
and business model, together with the focus of the Board of
Directors on issues of sustainability.

In 2019, the Company also organised a dedicated induction
programme to give directors adequate knowledge of the
Group's business activities, as well as its corporate dynamics
and their evolution, market trends and legal framework; Stat-
utory Auditors also took part in this programme. Initiatives
in 2019 included the creation of sustainable value (referring,
among others, to the Enel Group's 2019-2021 Sustainabili-
ty Plan and the positioning of the Group companies in the
main sustainability indices), the activities and strategies of
the Enel X Global Business Line, as well as in-depth meet-
ings dedicated to Latin America Region and the principles of
correct risk management.
