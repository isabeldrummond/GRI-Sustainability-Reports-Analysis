in the existing thermal plants, it is also evolving to-
wards mixed sources, renewable energies, in addi-
tion to reducing power generation from fossil fuels
sources by changing the scope of its power stations.
The total water requirements for the Group's production
activities are covered by withdrawing from sources that
are non-scarce (seawater), scarce (surface freshwater,
groundwater and water from industrial aqueducts) or
through the use of wastewater from production process-
es. The Group is committed to reducing water consump-
tion in its production processes, specifically promoting
water recirculation within the plants. In some coal-fired
power stations, for example, drainage water from the
closed-circuit cooling towers is reused in desulphuri-
sation, whereas the use of crystallisers downstream
to the desulphurisers allows the total recovery of the
wastewater.
Enel is constantly monitoring all its production sites lo-
cated in areas at risk of water scarcity in order to man-
age the water resource as efficiently as possible. In par
ticular, site monitoring takes place through the following
levels of analysis:
> mapping of the production sites located in potential
“water scarcity” areas, where the average value of
the renewable water resources per person is below
the benchmark set by the FAO (mapping is done
using the Global Water Tool of the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development);
> identification of “critical” production sites, i.e.
production sites in “Water Scarcity Areas" with a
freshwater supply;
> more efficient water management to maximise
wastewater and seawater supplies
In 2019, approximately 8% of total energy produced
by the Enel Group used freshwater in so-called “water
stressed" areas®. In these areas, water is withdrawn
mainly from scarce source and comprises 14% of the
Group's overall supply.
The high increase in the number of solar plants, natural-
ly suited to installation in “water stressed" areas, had
brought to the fore a new water use connected with
the cleaning of dust deposits on the surfaces of the
photo-voltaic panels. Although these represent insignif-

which, after recovery and reuse for internal purposes,
is returned to the original surface water bodies. Water
is always discharged downstream to the treatment pro-
cess, removing any potential pollutants present to avoid
any negative impacts, always within the national bench-
marked and regulatory standards. Where locally permit-
ted, Enel uses, as incoming water resources for its own
processes, wastewaters, typically supplied by waste
management consortia downstream to the treatment
processes.

Responsible and integrated management of the hy-
dro-geological basins to preserve their multiple land
uses and water quality. The activities of hydroelectric
power stations are an important element of water man-
agement. These power stations, which do not contrib-
ute to the Group's water consumption in that the water
withdrawn is completely returned to its source, provide
a series of additional services for the Company in solely
generating renewable energies.

In fact, a variety of power stations, jointly managed by
public stakeholders and private entities, manage the
water resource for multi-purpose services ranging from
flood control, drinking water and irrigation, fire preven-
tion services, to river waste dam retention works, with-
out forgetting numerous cultural initiatives, leisure and
nature-based activities organised with respect to the
installations themselves. The contribution of the hydro-
electric power plant reservoirs is particularly relevant in
counteracting the effects of climate change as the plant
increases the level of community protection in areas
where communities are consistently subject to increas-
ingly frequent extreme flooding events or long periods
of drought.

It can be furthermore underlined the management of the
outflows from the hydroelectric power stations through
specific programmes to ensure the required volumes to
preserve river ecology (minimum vital water flows).
