Cyber security

Digitalization opens new opportunities but also throws down
new challenges in the security field. In the electrical sector
in particular, service continuity is of critical importance, mak-
ing it essential to be able to withstand cyber attacks. Indeed,
a large-scale power outage could impact private citizens,
businesses, institutions and essential services. Enel has
adopted a systemic model that makes it possible to increase
prevention and the ability to respond to possible attacks for
all of its assets.

Policies and management

In September 2016, the “Cyber Security” unit, headed by
the Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), was set
up within the Global Digital, reporting directly to the Chief
Information Officer (ClO). The unit is engaged in guaran-
teeing the operation, management, and control of cyber se-

In 2019, electricity consumption outside normal working
hours? continued to be monitored. This is related to the IT
workstations (desktops, laptops, monitors) of Enel people
working in Italy. This measurement is possible thanks to
a Microsoft® feature available on the workstations, which
made it possible to identify when they were turned on and
not used. Following the analysis, specific awareness actions
were defined aimed at mitigating electricity consumption.
While showing an increase in hours of inactivity, the new IT
tools made available to Enel people have enabled a reduc-
tion in emissions.

2 Monday-Friday (from 7pm to 7am); Saturday and Sunday. The monitoring
excluded servers and personal computers that must always remain on (for
example, GESI application, Enel Points, Power Exchange, etc.). Specifically,
the indicator represents the amount of CO, associated with the electricity
consumption of desktops, laptops and monitors, to which the average CO,
emission value is then applied per unit of electricity produced (gCO,/kWh)
relative to the mix of sources in Italy.

curity issues, defining strategies, policies and guidelines in
compliance with national and international legislation, and
monitoring Group cyber security by means of process-based
and technical checks.

The unit operates in synergy with the Business Lines and
with the technical units responsible for design and manage-
ment of the systems, thanks to the “Cyber Security Risk
Managers” and “Cyber Security Response Managers”. The
CISO and Cyber Security Risk Managers also set up the
“Cyber Risk Working Committee” with the aim of evaluat-
ing IT risks horizontally in order to consolidate the approach
to risk treatment and achieve the Group's risk posture. The
“Cyber Security Risks Committee", chaired by Enel’s
Chief Executive Officer and composed of his main front
lines, approves the cyber security strategy and periodically
checks the progress of its implementation. Each Group area
department participates actively in implementing the cyber
security strategy by means of an integrated operating plan
