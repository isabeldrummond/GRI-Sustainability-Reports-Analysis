Environmental
risks

Social dimension

Last year saw the continuation of the growth in the sensitiv-
ity of the entire community to risks connected with develop-
ment models that generate environmental impacts and exploit
scarce natural resources (including many raw materials and
water). In some cases, the synergistic effects between these
impacts - such as global warming and the growing exploitation
and degradation of water resources — increase the risk of envi-
ronmental emergencies arising in the most sensitive areas of
the planet, with the risk of various water resource uses having
to compete, such as industrial, agricultural and civil uses.

In response to these needs, govemments have imposed in-
creasingly restrictive environmental regulations, placing ever
more stringent constraints on the development of new indus-
trial initiatives and, in the most impactful industries, incentiviz-
ing or requiring the elimination of technologies no longer con-
sidered sustainable

In this context, companies in every sector, and above all indus-
try leaders, are ever more aware that environmental risks are
increasingly economic risks. As a result, they are called upon
to increase their commitment and accountability for developing
and adopting innovative and sustainable technical solutions and
development models.

Enel has made the effective prevention and minimization of en-
vironmental impacts and risks a foundational element of each
project across its entire life cycle.

The adoption of ISO 14001-certified environmental manage-
ment systems certified in all Group divisions ensure the imple-
mentation of structured policies and procedures to identify and
manage the environmental risks and opportunities associated
with all corporate activities.

Also contributing are the multitude of actions to achieve the
challenging environmental improvement objectives set by Enel,
such as, for example, those regarding atmospheric emissions,
waste production and water consumption, especially in areas
with high water stress.

The risk of water scarcity is directly mitigated by Enel's devel-
opment strategy, which is based on the growth of generation
from renewable sources that are essentially not dependent on
the availability of water for their operation. Special attention
is also devoted to assets in areas with a high level of water
stress, in order to develop technological solutions to reduce
consumption.

Finally, ongoing collaboration with local river basin manage-
ment authorities enables us to adopt the most effective shared
strategies for the sustainable management of hydroelectric
generation assets.

Risks linked to
human capital

The profound transformations of the energy sector, which has
experienced sweeping technological developments, require
the presence of new professional profiles and skills, as well as
an important cultural and organizational change. Organizations
must move to adopt new agile and flexible business models.
Policies to enhance diversity and to manage and promote tal-
ent have become key factors for companies that are managing
the transition and have a widespread geographical presence

Enel places the people who work for it at the centre of its
business model: the management of human capital is a pri-
ority for which specific objectives have been established. The
main goals include: the development of the digital capabilities
and skills made necessary by the Fourth Industrial Revolution,
as well as the promotion of reskilling and upskilling programs
for employees in order to support the energy transition; the
effective involvement of employees in the pursuit of the corpo-
rate purpose, which ensures the achievement of better results
while offering greater satisfaction to our people; the develop-
ment of systems for evaluating the working environment and
performance; the dissemination of diversity and inclusion pol-
icies to all countries in which the Group operates, as well as
instilling an inclusive organizational culture based on the prin-
ciples of non-discrimination and equal opportunity, a key driver
in ensuring that everyone can make an effective contribution.
In addition, Enel is developing specific initiatives to foster the
diffusion of agile working methods in business processes.
