Quality of service
and promotion

of responsible consumption

The leadership of a company like Enel involves customer
care and attention to providing a quality service, not only
in the supply of electricity and/or natural gas, but also and
above all in the intangible aspects of the service related to
customer perception and satisfaction. The multiple areas of
activity include: the development of new contact methods
and channels; the improvement of back-office processes;
monitoring of complaints and enquiries in order to reduce
processing times and ensure proper management; analysis
of customer reports, in order to understand customer per-
ception and any critical issues in progress, so that the appro-
priate corrective actions can be implemented immediately
without compromising overall customer satisfaction.

In 2019, Enel promoted the adoption of new solutions and
innovative technologies aimed at improving the customer
experience and also involving startups and stakeholders, as
well as sharing best practices in order to spread them to the
various countries of operation with specific market-related
customisations, thus minimising time-to-market. Relations
with consumer associations have been intensified, exploring
collaboration opportunities aimed at improving the relation-
ship with customers and working together to create services
that increasingly respond to new needs and requirements,
without neglecting the weaker sections of the population.
In April 2019, the Company launched the “Mass customi-
zation & inclusion” challenge, aimed at gathering innovative
ideas and proposals for customised products and services
considering diversity and inclusion issues. The winning pro-
posal was the “e-domorent” project for the sustainable use
of home appliances. In addition, four creative sessions were
organised involving over 100 people from the retail area, in
Bogota and Bucharest, aimed at finding new and innovative
ideas to launch cutting-edge solutions, products and servic-
es on the market.

Finally, the main lines of action for the next three years, con-
cerning customer centrality, circular economy, digitalization
and sustainability, were identified and shared. Putting the
customer at the centre means developing new relationship
models that promote listening and involvement to ensure

the continuous improvement of services. Enel also under-
takes to enhance the contribution that each individual cus-
tomer can make to decreasing their impact on the planet,
adopting consumption styles geared towards the use of
renewable energy, recycling and reuse, sharing and reduc-
ing waste, starting with paper contracts and bills. A push to
simplify all stages of the “customer journey” by disseminat-
ing innovative services that support the customer, from the
signing of new exclusively paperless contracts and simple
interactions to check energy use and receive digital bills, to
electronic payments, including instalment plans, through vir-
tual assistants, apps and chatbots. Enel’s commitment to
the right energy transition for everyone puts it at the fore-
front in offering innovative and inclusive services for elderly
customers, weak, destitute, marginalised, vulnerable fami-
lies or disabled people (Pedius, Braille bill, compatible sites
for the visually impaired).
