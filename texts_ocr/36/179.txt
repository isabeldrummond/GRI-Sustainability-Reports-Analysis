in terms of energy efficiency were implemented. In Italy, for
example, in 2019, for E-Distribuzione, a total of 1,651,295
ESC (Energy Saving Certificates*) were purchased, in ad-
dition to 769,033 ESCs to finalise the quotas due for 2018
(end May 2019); during the period June-December 2019,
necessary ESCs were purchased to acquit the annual 2019
obligation due on May 31, 2020. Romania on the other hand
saw savings for approximately 160,000 GJ, thanks to main-
tenance and upgrading works carried out in the stations and

5 Energy Saving Certificates (also known as white certificates) issued by Ge-
store del Servizio Elettrico (Electrical Services Authority) are the equivalent
of saving 1 ton of oil equivalent (toe) which is the standard measurement
unit commonly used in energy reports to express all sources of energy, ta-
king into account their calorific value. Electricity distributors can thus achie-
ve their targets of energy efficiency increase by realising energy-saving
projects and by obtaining the associated issuance of ESCs, or by buying
ESCs from other parties,

substations as well as the replacement of equipment and
power transformers, restructuring works and upgrades of
the transformation stations and the installation and use of
smart meters. In Spain, in the Puentes nuclear power plant,
83,450 GJ where saved due to upgraded cooling towers, tur
bines as well as interventions to minimise the losses from
the air pre-heaters and the replacement of conventional
equipment with LED devices.

Responsible use of water resources is one of the strategic
targets of the environmental policy and requires the adop-
tion of an integrated approach based on three lines of action
as shown below.

+ Efficient use of water resources also through con-
trol of leaks. The Enel Group collects water from water
sources mainly for industrial uses, such as cooling and
airborne abatement systems (for example desulphuri-
sation, the abatement of nitrogen oxides), and uses it
for the most part for thermal and nuclear generation. In
2019, total water requirement amounted to approxi-
mately 773 mil m3, down by around 20% compared to
2018 (96.3 mil m*), due to a lower thermal generation,
especially from coal®. The Group's specific water re-
quirement, including thermal, nuclear, geothermal, and
other activities for industrial uses, amounted to 0.33 I/
kWh,, in 2019, about 13% lower than the previous year
in line with the target to reduce the Group's specific wa-
ter requirement’.

Enel pursues the target of reducing its specific water
requirement. The target of a 30% reduction by 2020,
with respect to the 2010 values, was achieved by the
2017 results, three years in advance. The Group set a
further reduction target of 50% for water specific con-
sumption by 2030 in relation to 2017. From the results
achieved, and based on the three-year Industrial Plan
which envisages an efficient use of water resources

o

This value does not include water used in open-cycle cooling because the
same quantity of water used is returned to the original water body without
any altered chemical characteristics and with minimum temperature va-
riations (always within the limits fixed by the statutory regulations of the
countries where Enel operates)

7 Compared to the base year 2010, there was a 51% reduction in specific
water requirement.
