Responsible community relations consti
tute a pillar of Enel's strategy. Constantly
and proactively considering the needs and
priorities of society makes it possible to
accept new challenges and redefine an in-
creasingly competitive business model, de-
veloping new strategies and innovating in
processes, also through scalable solutions.
In 2019, with around 1,800 projects and
more than 4 million beneficiaries in the
countries in which it is present, Enel made
a tangible contribution to development and
social and economic growth of local areas:
from the expansion of infrastructure to ed-
ucation and training programmes, from ini
tiatives aimed at social inclusion to projects
designed to support cultural and economic
activities. The essential lever to carry out

these projects is the recourse to around 800
partnerships with organisations, compa
nies, and institutions operating on the local
and intemational level that promote devel
opment of the territory through innovative
and tailored interventions.

Sustainability of the strategy is confirmed
also by the progress made in terms of the
Group's contribution to achieving the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
with special reference to projects aimed
at guaranteeing inclusive and equitable
quality education (SDG 4), offering ac-
cess to affordable, reliable, sustainable
and modern energy (SDG 7) and promot-
ing sustained, inclusive and sustainable
economic growth (SDG 8).

Awareness of the context in which Enel
operates and active attention to all stake-
holders are essential factors to combine
economic and social growth over the long
term. Enel adopts a creating shared value

(CSV) model that integrates sociatenviron-
mental factors in the business process-
es and throughout the entire value chain,
with special reference to operations of
business development, engineering and
construction, in addition to management
and maintenance of assets. The model is
composed of six stages that can also be
carried out on an individual basis: context
analysis, stakeholder identification, anal-
ysis of materiality and potential risks/op-
portunities, definition of a plan of shared
actions, execution of the plan in question,
monitoring, assessment and reporting.
1,375 applications of the CSV model’
were executed in 2019 in the various
phases of the value chain, with an inclu-
sive approach towards stakeholders.

7. An application is construed as the use of atleast one
CSV instrument in relation to an asset, in any phase
of the value chain and in any Business Line.
