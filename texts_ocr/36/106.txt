be conducted in accordance with the model set down in the
Enel Global Framework Agreement (GFA) signed in Rome in
2013 with the Italian federations and the global federations
IndustriALL and Public Services International. The agreement
is founded on the principles of human rights, labour rights
and of the best and most advanced transnational industrial
relation systems of the reference multinational groups and in-
stitutions on the international level, including the ILO. These
principles include the principle on remuneration, whereby the
minimum compensation of the Group's employees cannot be
lower than the level established by the collective bargaining
contacts and legislative and regulatory treatments in force in
the various countries, in line with the matters set down in the
ILO conventions. Enel guarantees that the equal pay principle
is respected in all countries in which it is present and it is
committed to guarantee a living wage to all its employees.

In the framework of this agreement, Enel recognises the right
of its employees to set up or participate in trade union as-
sociations in order to protect their interests. It also awards
them the right to be represented, in the various generation
units, by trade union organisations and other forms of rep-

resentation elected in compliance with the legislation and
practices in force in the countries concerned. Enel recognises
the value of collective bargaining as a tool to determine the
contractual conditions of its employees and to regulate rela-
tions between company management and trade union asso-
ciations. Enel complies with the principle of independence of
unions and does not interfere in any way with the organisation
of representation, allowing access of its employees’ repre-
sentatives to the workplaces in order to communicate with
their members, in compliance with the law and the industrial
relations systems in force in each country. Enel supplies ad-
equate information to its employees and to the trade union
organisations that represent them, in order to facilitate col-
lective bargaining. The GFA agreement was also recognised
and acclaimed as a best practice among European and non-
EU multinationals. Enel provides its people with a full range
of information concerning collective labour agreements and
trade union agreements, in accordance with the provisions of
statutory legislation and by means of the company intranet.
