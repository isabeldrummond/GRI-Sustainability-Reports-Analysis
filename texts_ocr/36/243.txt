Assessment of priorities to the issues
in company strategies

(as=1)

The materiality of the various issues in Enel’s strategies has
been assessed through the involvement of the various compa-
ny Functions and has been submitted for review by the Chair-
man and Chief Executive Officer. This analysis reflects the stra-
tegic guidelines set by the 2020-2022 Strategic Plan, the goals
of the Functions/Business Lines and the commitments made
by the Group through its policies and rules of conduct. The
aspect examined for the issues subject to analysis measures
the level of the impact of the issues on company strategies.
In order to identify the Company's positive and negative
impacts on socio-economic development and on the envi-
ronment in the countries in which it operates, as well as its
contribution to sustainable development, an “Impact Evalua-
tion” pilot project was launched in 2019. The project, which
involved five countries", was carried out by each local Sustain-
ability unit, with the involvement of all Functions responsible
for managing the issues subject to analysis, and included an
assessment of the extent of the impact, in accordance with
the main standards of reference; in addition, each issue was
analysed according to its direct and indirect contribution to the
SDGs, in line with the commitment made by the Group, and

observance of the management tools implemented to moni-
tor those impacts.

In particular, the analysis conducted in Brazil provides an ex-
planatory overview of the project described above. Indeed,
with regard to one of the material issues, “Energy distribu-
tion”, the Country concluded that the development of the
network gives rise to several positive external impacts, such
as improvement of service, the creation of new job opportu-
nities, through the spread of smart meters, and the poten-
tial reduction of possible environmental incidents thanks to
a more efficient and modern network. However, this issue
also entails negative impacts, such as possible workplace
incidents related to network development activities, and the
potential loss of biodiversity due to the pruning operations.
In addition, during 2019 the “Actual Response” project,
launched in 2018, was developed. This project involved nine
countries and aimed to collect and elaborate the measures
taken by Group companies to manage the highest priority
issues, such as risk analysis, definition of targets and the
study of the performances achieved, in order to conduct a
comparative assessment of the Company's level of presidi-
um on these issues.

Reconciliation of the issues of the
materiality analysis and GRI Standards

 

The joint analysis of the stakeholder and Company aspects,
through its representation in the materiality matrix present-
ed in the “Materiality analysis” section of the “At a Glance”
chapter, enabled an assessment of the degree of “align-
ment” or “misalignment” between the priority of action
assigned by the stakeholders to the various issues and the

degree of commitment that the Group has made to each of
them. The following table contains the codes for the topics
included in the materiality analysis as established in the GRI
Standards or the “Aspects” of the GRI supplement dedicat-
ed to the electric utilities sector ("Electric Utilities Sector
Disclosures") of reference, along with an indication of the
context internal and external to the organization and the lim-
itations on the scope.
