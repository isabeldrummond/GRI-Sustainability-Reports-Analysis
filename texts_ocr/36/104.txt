Enel is attentive to organisational and personal well-being, and

has pursued an undertaking for several years to promote solu-

tions to improve work-life balance and to support the tangible

and daily needs of individuals in order to respect all the situ-

ations, also of a contingent nature, that an individual may be

required to deal with during his or her working life. The caring

activities, which involve all Enel people, concern the spheres

of personal and family life, psychological-physical weltbeing,

organisational matters, and work-life balance.

In particular, Enel promotes:

> organisational caring: various forms of flexibility, including
smart working, which was launched in Italy in 2016 and
then extended to the Group's other countries, and which
leverages individual responsibility and the relationship of
trust between the individual and the Company and that
also supports a contribution to reducing environmental im-
pact. At the end of 2019 more than 10 thousand people in
Italy and 17 thousand in the entire Group were involved in
smart working initiatives;

> personal caring: mindfulness courses, workshops on nu-

 

tritional and relational well-being, programmes to promote

physical exercise, courses in yoga, pilates and postural
gymnastics, and life saving actions for proactive manage-
ment of psychological-physical welHbeing, both at work
and in personal life. Cultural meetings were also staged
to promote discussions concerning relevant topics in the
company and personal sphere;
> family caring: specific projects such as “Together Digital
Day’' a cyber security and coding laboratory for employees
and their children from 8 to 16 years of age, and “Millen-
nials Enel Day’ a workshop with the purpose of orienting
employees’ children aged from 18 to 27 in their choice of
educational and professional paths in an increasingly com-
plex job market. In 2019 these initiatives involved around
100 young people.
Staff in Italy can also transfer holidays and time-off for solidari-
ty motives among co-workers of the same company to assist
young children or adolescents, parents, spouses, members of
a civil union or unmarried couples who require constant treat-
ment or in the case of very serious personal or family situa-
tions. In addition to holidays donated by co-workers, Enel offers
an equal amount of paid leave.
