 

situation in question, as well as current best practices at
national and international level.

The various risk types are included in the paragraph “Setting
priorities” and in the 2019 Annual Report, available on the
Company website (www.enel.com).

For a detailed description of the tasks and responsibilities of
the main individuals involved in the SCIGR, as well as their
respective coordination procedures, refer to the Guidelines of
the Internal Control and Risk Management System available on
the Company website (www.enel.com, “Investors” section).

Main ESG risk types

Due to the nature of its business and geographic presence,

the Group is exposed to various types of environmental, social

and governance-related (ESG) risks, of which the main types

are indicated in the table below, together with the activities for

mitigating their effects and ensuring their proper management.

The following was considered in identifying potential risks:

+> the results of the materiality analysis (see the section ‘Ata
Glance" - “Definition of priorities” and the Methodological
note in this document);

> the 2020 Global Risk Report of the World Economic Forum
(WEF), involving more than 1,000 experts and leaders
from around the world;
the risk assessment carried out as part of Enel's due
diligence process on human rights, which involved a
wide range of experts from different sectors, including

Sound governance

civil society, academic institutions, local communities,
customers and suppliers, in the various countries where
the Group operates;
> the analyses of some of the world’s most highly
acclaimed ESG rating agencies, which use specific risk
assessment systems to rate companies’ sustainability
performance.
The risks identification from the analysis of these results,
which gather the level of risk perceived by the relevant external
stakeholders, is aligned with the overall identification of the
risks carried out by Enel to select the main risks (financial,
strategic, governance, operational, digital and compliance)
to which it may be exposed and which require continuous
monitoring through the internal auditing process.
Moreover, in the risk identification and assessment stage,
the “Precautionary Principle"* was applied, particularly to
risks relating to the environment, health and safety. For each
type of risk, specific actions have been identified to mitigate
their effects and ensure their proper management. Enel
also applies this principle to risk management, especially
with regard to the development and introduction of new
products/technologies, planning of operating activities and
the construction of new plants/assets.
