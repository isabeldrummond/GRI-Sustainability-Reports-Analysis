Commitment to
the fight against
climate change

Enel’s action against
climate change

According to the estimates of the IPCC! (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change), global warming has become a reality. The temperature has increased 1
°C compared with pre-industrial levels and, if it continues to grow at the current
rate, the increase will probably reach 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2050. The green-
house gas (GHG) emissions have been constantly increasing over the past decade
and there is no clear signal that they will peak over the upcoming years. The sci-
entific community is asking for urgent action to speed up the transition towards
a zero-emissions economy in order to minimise the impact of climate change.
In 2019, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) pointed out that, if
global greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced 7.6% every year between 2020
and 2030, it will not be possible to reach the targets of the Paris Agreement.

In this context, it is essential to promote collaboration between governments,
companies, financial institutions and civil society by developing the awareness of
the various stakeholders about topics related to climate change. Companies play
a fundamental role as they are responsible for the majority of global emissions
but, at the same time, they have a unique ability to develop innovative solutions to
contribute towards their reduction on a large scale. The electricity sector can work
towards reducing emissions related to the energy production and at the same
time promote the electrification of the energy demand in order to support the
decarbonization of other industries and services. Being aware of this challenge,
Enel has set itself the objective of reaching the decarbonization of its energy
mix by 2050, as announced publicly in 2015 when the United Nations launched
its sustainable development goals, with particular reference to SDG 13 “Climate

1 The IPCC, founded by UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and WMO (World Meteorologi-
cal Organization) in 1988, is the main international organization for climate change monitoring. The IPCC
provides regular assessments of the scientific basis of climate change aimed at supporting governments
in the definition of climate policies.
