In order to consolidate the culture of safety and promote
the adoption of behaviours that are consistent with compa-
ny policies, Enel supports social dialogue and participation
of workers’ representatives. Joint committees have been
set up for this purpose in the main countries in which Enel
is present, dedicated to monitoring the issues and projects
concerning workers’ health and safety on the national level
and also in terms of Business Lines. In Italy, in implementa-
tion of the matters provided for by the national trade union
agreement on the “Italian model! of Enel Italia industrial

analogous bilateral commission at the Group level, which
defined a “joint recommendation” concerning health and
safety standards applicable in all Enel countries. In 2019 ne-
gations were set in motion to renew the Enel Global Frame-
work Agreement to be signed in 2020. The following details
