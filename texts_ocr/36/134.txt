SDGs 9 and 11, to virtualization of the asset management
operating activities, and to promoting the use of videocom-
munication systems, in accordance with SDG 12.

Digital transformation in Enel is guided by the “Global Dig-
ital Solutions” unit which, working together with all the
Holding's Business Lines and Functions, guides strategic

choices, defines the paths of development and guarantees
their implementation. The Enel operating models call for an
agile working approach to anticipate market demand, with
constant attention paid to the satisfaction of internal and ex-
ternal customers, to guarantee innovation and flexibility and
the Company's ability to adapt and react to change rapid-
ly. The “Global Customer Digital Hub” was created in 2019
starting from customer-focused activities managed by Coun-
try/regional units, in order to maximize the digital impact
and promote synergies generated by the integration of the
competences of the IT platforms and teams from different
countries. This has guaranteed consistency and uniformity
among projects and initiatives in different countries, efficien-
cy of costs through centralised sourcing, and faster time-to-

Innovation and digitalizatior

market. In addition, the “Enel X Digital Hub” Function has
been reorganised, with the introduction of a Digital Factory
for each Product Line to manage design, development and
adoption of the associated digital solutions.

To support the business over the next three years specif-
ic investments are planned to develop the platform busi-
ness model, which will primarily involve the three com-
pany areas of Global Infrastructure and Networks, Retail,
and Enel X. For Infrastructure and Networks the global
platform will make it possible to standardise operations
and maintenance, customer management processes, and
allocation of resources and systems. For Retail, a global
platform will be constructed to allow standardisation of
processes and the back-end and front-end systems, such
as the development of global products, thus constructing
the operating model around products and services rather
than around local markets. Finally, Enel X is a business
platform by design model, in which innovative products
and services are developed and supplied to customers all
over the world. This constitutes an enormous opportunity
to create new markets.
