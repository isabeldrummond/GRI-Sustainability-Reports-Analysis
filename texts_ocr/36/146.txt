tion of operating activities, guaranteeing optimal condi-
tions of good health, safety, comfort and well-being;

+ rigorous selection and management of contractors and
vendors, promoting their involvement in safety perfor
mance continual improvement programmes;

+> constant attention towards communities and towards
all those who work with or come into contact with the
Group's activities by sharing a culture of health and safe-
ty protection;

> annual definition of specific and measurable goals and
continual monitoring to check their effective implemen-
tation through the involvement of top management.

In January 2019 Enel updated its Health & Safety Policy in

compliance with the principles set down in the Statement of

Commitment to Health and Safety and in the Code of Ethics.

In pursuit of the Policy, each of the Group's Business Lines

is equipped with its own Occupational Health & Safety Man-

agement System in compliance with international standard

ISO 45001, based on identification of hazards, qualitative

and quantitative risk assessment, planning and implemen-

tation of preventive and protective measures, verification of
the effectiveness of preventive and protective measures,
and on any corrective actions to be undertaken

The Management System involves both Enel people and the

personnel of contractors working on Enel's plants/sites. Each

system that involves both Enel people and the personnel of
contractors working on Enel's plants and sites includes the
following shared aspects:

+ prior evaluation, elimination and/or reduction of risks
through application of the latest technical know-how;

+> identification of the necessary preventive measures and
the associated implementation programme;

+ adoption of residual risk mitigation measures, awarding
priority to collective rather than personal solutions;

+> active, responsible, and integrated intervention of all
parties concerned with safety, involving workers and/
or workers’ representatives, starting from the identifi-
cation of risk situations up to the choice of solutions to
prevent and/or reduce them;

> appointment of a medical officer, when required, and
setting up health surveillance for workers responsible
for specific high-risk processes;

> preparation of a programme of information and training
of workers in order to increase awareness when dealing
with situations of risk;

+> regular upkeep and cleaning of workplaces.

From an organisational perspective, the Holding Health,

Occupational health and safety

 

Safety, Environment and Quality unit (HSEQ) assumes the
roles of supervision, guidance and coordination, promoting
the dissemination and sharing of best practices within the
Group and external health and safety benchmarking with top
international players in order to identify improvement oppor
tunities and ensure constant commitment in the area of risk

reduction. Alongside the Holding Function, the Global Busi-
ness Lines HSEQ structures orient and support the business
in relation to health and safety issues, define improvement
plans and monitor their execution.

In confirmation of the strategy implemented and the safety
policies put in place by Enel, several initiatives were carried
out in 2019, aimed mainly at strengthening horizontal activi-
ties across Business Lines and/or Countries. “Country Com-
mittees” have been set up with the goal of favouring syner
gies between the Business Lines operating in the Country in
order to improve safety performance. Committee meetings
are held periodically, usually once a month, and chaired by
the Country Manager. The committees are attended by all
the managers of the Country Business Lines and the asso-
ciated HSEQ managers plus the heads of the People and
Organization, Procurement and Legal Functions. The Safety
KPls are analysed during the meetings, sharing also best
practices and information concerning events of particular sig-
nificance in terms of safety related aspects; moreover, the
states of completion of projects shared by multiple Business
Lines and launched by the committee in question are coor
dinated and analysed. The committees are currently active in
all countries in South America, in the USA, Italy, Spain and
Russia
