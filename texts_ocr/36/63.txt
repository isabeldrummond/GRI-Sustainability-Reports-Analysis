Identification, assessment
and management of
transition-related risks
and opportunities

As regards the risks and opportunities associated with transi-
tion variables, Enel uses the different reference scenarios in
combination with the various elements that make up the risk
identification process (e.g. competitive context, long-term vi-
sion of the industry, materiality analysis, etc.). Priority is given
to the most material phenomena. The main risks and oppor-
tunities identified within this framework are described below.

Policy and Regulation
+ Limits on emissions and carbon pri
actment of laws and regulations that introduce more

 

ing: the en-

stringent emissions limits by government action
(non-market driven) and market-based mechanisms,
such as a carbon tax in non-ETS (Emissions Trading
System) sectors or an expansion of the ETS in other
sectors.
> Opportunities: command & control regulations
and market-based mechanisms strengthening
CO, price signals to foster investment in car-
bon-free technologies
> Risk: lack of a coordinated approach among the
various actors and policy-makers involved and
limited effectiveness of the policy instruments
deployed, with an impact on the speed of the
trend towards electrification and decarbonization
in the various sectors, compared with a decisive
group strategy focused on the energy transition.
+ Incentives for the energy transition: development
incentives and opportunities with a view to the en-
ergy transition, consequently guiding the energy
system towards the use of low-emission energy re-
sources as the mainstream approach in the energy
mixes of countries, greater electrification of energy
consumption, energy efficiency, flexibility of the elec-
trical system and upgrading of infrastructure, with a
positive impact on the return on investment and new
business opportunities.
> Opportunities: additional volumes and great-
er margins due to additional investment in the
electricity industry, in line with the electrification

62

strategy, decarbonization and the upgrading of
enabling infrastructure.

> Risks: obstacles to achieving energy transition
targets due to regulatory systems that do no ef-
fectively support the energy transition, delays in
permitting, no upgrading of the electricity grid,
etc.

Resilience regulation To improve standards or intro-

duce ad hoc mechanisms to incentivise investments

 

in resilience in the context of the evolution of climate
change.
> Opportunities: benefits from investments that
reduce service quality and continuity risks for the
community.
> Risks: in the case of especially severe extreme
events with a greater-than-expected impact,
there is a risk that recovery could be slower than
planned, with an associated reputational risk.
Financial measures for the energy transition: |n-
centives for the energy transition through appropri-
ate policy measures and financial instruments, which
should be capable of supporting an investment frame-
work and a long-term, credible and stable positioning
of policy-makers. Introduction of rules and/or public
and private financial instruments (e.g. funds, mecha-
nisms, taxonomies, benchmarks) aimed at integrating
sustainability into financial markets and public finance
instruments.

 

> Opportunities: the creation of new markets and
sustainable finance products consistent with the
investment framework, activating greater public
resources for decarbonization and access to fi-
nancial resources in line with energy transition
objectives and the related impact on costs and on
finance charges; introduction of subsidised sup-
port tools (funds and calls) for the transition.

> Risks: actions and instruments are not sufficient
to provide incentives consistent with an overall
positioning tailored to the energy transition, un-
certainty or slowdown in the introduction of new
instruments and rules due to the deterioration in
the public finances or differences in application
in the geographic areas in which the Group oper-
ates.
