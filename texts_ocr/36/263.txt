n.a. not applicable

(1) For projects entered into operation by September 30, 2019, the actual production data are reported and consequently the amount of CO, avoided.

(2) For projects entered into operation after September 30, 2019 or which have not yet entered into operation, the expected annual production data and the expected
amount of CO, avoided are reported.

(3) The share of production for only repowering cannot be separated from the rest of the plant because it is not possible to precisely determine the share of energy fed
to the network only due to the increase in power.
