Alto Bio Bio plants
(Ralco, Pangue
and Palmucho — Chile)

Enel Generacion Chile manages three hydroelectric power
plants in the area of Alto Bio Bio (Ralco, Pangue and Palmu-
cho), an area that is characterized by the historical presence
of the indigenous Pehuenche populations. In numbers, the
Pehuenche population in the area of influence of the plants
amounts to approximately 3,000 people, made up of 800
families in 10 communities (Pitril, Callaqui, El Avellano, Aukifi
Wallmapu, Quepuca Ralco, Ralco Lepoy, El Barco, Guayalli,
Pewen Mapu and Ayin Mapu).

In February 2017, an important collaboration agreement was
signed with 25 families of the Aukifi Wallmapu community
to start local development projects. The agreement resolves
the conflict regarding the impacts generated during the con-
struction of the Ralco plant. In March 2017, Enel Generacion
Chile officially handed over its ancestral cemetery to the
community of El Barco. This was made possible thanks to
the support of the Director General de la Corporacién Na-
cional de Desarollo Indigena (CONAD)) of the Bio Bio region,
thereby concretely demonstrating the commitment the
Company made with the community following the construc-
tion of the Pangue power plant. In June 2017, Enel Gener-
acion Chile also signed two agreements with the El Avellano
and Quepuca Ralco communities.

Social-economic development

Following a request made mainly by the El Avellano com-
munity, a community project was created in 2018 for the
collection, transformation and sale of hazelnuts. In 2019,
the production department was inaugurated, which made it
possible for the community to transform its autochthonous
hazelnuts into subproducts to supply to the market, thereby
expanding sales to other customers. The project is promot-
ed by Enel Generacion Chile, together with the University
of Concepcion, the community of El Avellano, the munici-
pality of Alto Bio Bio and the Pehuén foundation. It made it
possible to transform a traditional activity into a micro-entre-
preneurial activity for the community, while also preserving
the natural hazelnut forest. In consideration of the touristic
and recreational potential of the areas near the plants, and
in order to promote the social-economic development of the
local communities, specific projects promoting sustainable

Community and shared value

 

tourism were started. In particular, one was started for the
area adjacent to the El Barco Laguna, where local business
people currently offer camping, tour and gastronomy ser-
vices. More than 6,000 tourists visit the area every season,
representing an important potential for this initiative. The
collaboration between Enel and the community was carried
out mainly in order to improve the health situation of the
area, install new toilet facilities and drains for the treatment
of the waste water. A project is being developed in Los Cha-
icanes to promote potato cultivation. The initiative, which in-
itially aimed to sell the tuber locally to be eaten fresh, led to
the production of seed potatoes and the recognition of the
project by the agricultural and zootechnical service (Servicio
Agricola y Ganadero - SAG) as one of the 17 producers au-
thorised to sell seed potatoes in the 32 communities of the
region of La Araucania.

As concerns the direct support of local families and stu-
dents, Enel assigns scholarships to finance school fees, the
accommodations for young people in the cities where the
schools are located and other school materials. This initiative
has involved more than 700 students.

Shared and sustainable

water management

The Chilean Ministry of Public Works and Enel Generacion
Chile have signed an agreement, which was subsequently
ratified also with the local associations that manage the irri-
gation channels in the area of Saltos del Laja, in the Bio Bio
region. The objective of the agreement is to improve the
flexibility of use of the water, ensuring the supply to families
and the power generation. The initiative is the result of a
