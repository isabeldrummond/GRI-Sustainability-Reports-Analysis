Remedy

Around 160 actions have been planned, covering 100% of
operations and sites. New actions were launched in each
country of operation: for example, in Spain due diligence
assessments on human rights were applied to merger &
acquisition processes; in Italy, the E-Distribuzione proce-
dures were carried out with a key focus on human rights
aspects; in Romania, reporting mechanisms were devel-
oped for all areas with potential impacts; in Russia, human
rights aspects were included in the sustainability surveys
carried out with internal and external stakeholders. Also in
South American countries, numerous measures were tak-
en following the approval of the due diligence improvement
plan: in Argentina, communication on the use of the ethical
channel and on anti-bribery policy has been stepped up;
in Brazil, new business development processes were re-
viewed with the inclusion of due diligence on human rights;
in Peru, specific projects were implemented to promote
gender equality; in Chile, stakeholder groups were mapped
out that may be interested in the activities launched or with
the potential to be developed; in Colombia, five different
due diligences were carried out at the coal supplier sites.
With respect to labour rights lastly, on average, these are
perceived as being less risky, and also their monitoring
operations and processes comply with both the principles
of the most common international guidelines and with the
Group's internal policies. However, minor areas of improve-
ment have been identified in some countries, as shown in
the table below.

Security and Human Rights

 

“Taking the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human
Rights as its reference, Enel is committed to ensuring that
private security forces operating to protect Group people
and property in their areas of activity act consistently with
applicable national laws and international rules and stand-
ards, while encouraging law enforcement agencies to act in
the same manner” (paragraph 2.2.1 of Enel’s Human Rights
Policy). In general, according to national regulations, the se-
curity service can only be assigned to public or private forces
in the absence of legislative provisions.
Security management at Enel is assigned to a dedicated
Holding unit and to specific units in the various countries
where the Group operates. The principles of action concern:
+> Proactivity: continual collection of data and information
for the detection and interpretation of weak signals;
+> Holistic Vision: integrated assessment and manage-
ment of security risks for all potentially exposed assets
(people, infrastructure, intangible assets);
> Open Power: cooperation with Business Lines, refer
ence institutions and other operators of critical infra-
structure;
+> Resilience: adoption of measures to ensure the conti-
nuity of the system's operation and not only its passive
protection;
