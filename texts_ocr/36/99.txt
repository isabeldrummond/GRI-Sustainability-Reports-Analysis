The Enel training model is open to the outside, through the
Schools and Academies, which were reinforced in 2019.
The purpose of the programmes is to respond to the spe-
cific technical and specialised training needs of the various
business areas and to contribute to the development and
upskilling of technical and managerial competences they
contain, performed in collaboration with strategic academic
partners and with the support of Fondazione Enel. In par-
ticular, nine Schools were set up between 2016 and 2019,
engaging partners in the form of universities and renowned
research institutes, and five Academies were opened

In 2019, the process of qualitative and quantitative perfor-
mance appraisal saw the engagement of Group people at
various levels in a fluid process of exchange and across the
board feedback (360°feedback), shifting the focus towards
the organisational network rather than pursuing an hierarchi-
cal model. In particular, 100% of eligible and reachable peo-
ple were engaged in 2019', of whom 99%? were assessed
In contrast, the quantitative assessment was performed
for the population with variable remuneration, providing for
the allocation of objectives and their subsequent apprais-
al. Finally, the new campaign was launched for definition
of Succession Planning, the process whereby all Group
managers are required to identify the best talents available
to fill managerial roles in the short term (Ready) and in the
medium term (Pipeline). To complement the development
of successors, the manager and the People and Organiza-
tion Function identify personal growth projects based on
their individual and professional profile, in relation to the
positions for which they have been identified. Successor
identification is performed in accordance with the follow-
ing reference criteria: celebration of meritocracy, diversity
and functional osmosis. The appointment of new manag-
ers then occurs following an aptitude assessment, which
serves to check alignment between the level of responsibil-
ity to assign to the person in question and the management
model that the Company deems necessary for today and

Eligible and reachable: those who have an open-term contract and who
were in the workforce and active for at least three months in 2019.

the future. The assessment methodology is designed to
analyse competences, aptitudes, motivation and potential
of future managers and to assess their ability to interpret
Enel’s cultural identity in their daily actions, in a horizontal
manner with respect to the Group's professional families.
The assessment is designed to identify people capable of
implementing Open Power values and behaviours, to meet
the challenges that Enel intends to overcome. Specific
guidelines have been defined for management and identifi-
cation of future candidates in all the Group's countries
