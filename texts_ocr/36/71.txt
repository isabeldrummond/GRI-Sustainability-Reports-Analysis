1 Does not include managed capacity, equal to 3.7 GWin 2019 and 4.2 GWin 2018.

2 Does not include generation from managed capacity, equal to 10.2 TWh in 2019 and 9.7 TWh in 2018.

3. The % was calculated based on new methodology that does not consider the Italian oil & gas plants in the decommissioning phase/considered marginal. The
values do not include consumption and generation for the cogeneration related to the Russian thermoelectric park. The average efficiency value is calculated
based on the plants in the park and weighed based on generation values.

Net electricity production in 2019 totalled 229.1 TWh, a sions sources amounts to approximately 55% of total con-

decrease on 2018 that reflected an 18.7% decline in thermal solidated production (a significant increase in comparison to

production compared with the previous year, mainly due to 2018, equal to 49.2%), whereas it is equal to around 57%
