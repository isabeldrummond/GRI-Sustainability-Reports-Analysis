In line with the current transformation scenario, which re-
quires new skills and professional profiles, selection and
recruiting, training and development processes play a
key role in the Company. There were more than 3,700
new recruits in 2019, mainly in Italy and Latin America;
relations with universities were consolidated by means of a
series of ad hoc initiatives, and a new Recruiting Day pilot
project was launched based on an aptitudinal model aimed
at supporting the various recruiting requirements, creating
a pipeline of young people. Testing was also carried out on
new digital instruments that will support the selection pro-
cess in 2020: a video interview based on IA and a gamifica-
tion experience.

In a transformation scenario characterised by a high level
of automation, ever more advanced technological evolution
and new technical and professional profiles, Enel has devel-
oped upskilling and reskilling programmes that promote
the evolution of talents and skills. In particular, the upskill-
ing programmes focus on the development of existing pro-
fessional competences, adding new skills according to the
needs dictated by innovative technology and processes.
Conversely, reskilling is aimed at creating new professional
profiles, replacing skills that have become obsolete or are
no longer required, and allowing people to work on new
activities.

Continuous learning plays a core role for Enel. A total of
2,600,000 training hours (38.8 average hours pro capite)
were delivered in 2019, with the involvement of 62,482
people, equal to 91.5% of the entire workforce. Training
activities concern all aspects and targets: technical, be-
havioural, managerial, agile linguistic, onboarding expe-
rience for new recruits, training in health and safety, and
in digital skills and culture. This is an authentic lab aimed
at increasing the occupational and personal competitive-
ness of all people, providing them with tools and methods
to allow them to adopt an aware stance when facing the
radical processes of change that impact working methods
from a cultural and organisational perspective. In addition,
the Company's commitment continues to support not only

the dissemination of digital competences and learning, but
a digital culture above all. At 2019 Enel had engaged 46%
of people in training activities on digital skills, in line with
the goal of achieving 100% of its people within 2022. In
continuity with the evolutionary path of leadership started
in 2017 (from leader to coach), Enel has designed a cultural
transformation journey called “Leadership in Digital and
Data-Driven Transformation” addressed to management.
During these meetings, dialogue was promoted between
the best Italian and international companies, innovators in
transformation of the business model and in digital culture
development. In 2019, between April and December 19
training sessions were launched in Italy with the partici-
pation of more than 500 managers, and 12 sessions in the
rest of the world, with around 300 managers taking part.
This initiative is accompanied by experiential training activi-
ties such as mentoring, coaching and job shadowing.

In April 2019, global adoption was completed of the eDu-
cation learning platform, thanks to which management and
monitoring of all training initiatives is guaranteed by means
of a common service model in all Group countries. eDuca-
tion also is the interface providing access to residential and
online courses for all Enel people: to date nearly 90% of the
Enel population has completed at least one course on the
platform. The eDucation platform allows Enel people to ac-
cess around 200 multiple online contents in several lan-
guages selected from the best providers on the market and
constantly updated and expanded, in addition to the cours-
es produced by Enel. Apart from freely making use of the
courses, participants can become content promoters, sug-
gesting books, courses, articles, videos, links, documents
and reports, also from external sources, by means of the
“learning playlists", exchanging comments and attracting
followers, in an expression of the principles of networking
and knowledge sharing. In 2019, the main online courses of
global interest released concerned language skills for Ital-
ian, English and Spanish, which attracted more than 15,000
self-training participants worldwide; digital training on the
Office suite; knowledge of the e-commerce sector; training
