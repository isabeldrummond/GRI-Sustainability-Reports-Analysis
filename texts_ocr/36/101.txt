adequate tools to deal with situations of this type. The policy
provides definitions and indications on the whistle-blowing
and investigation process and on the related disciplinary and
preventive measures and is applicable to employees and third
parties working with Enel people in all contexts in which the
Company conducts its operations. Publication of the global
policy was followed by publication of various local policies
which, in certain cases, adapted the global policy to match
the regulatory framework in individual countries. The policy
concerns both moral and sexual harassment, referred to any
undesirable behaviour or conduct such that results in the cre-
ation of work conditions that are degrading, hostile, humili-
ating, intimidating, offensive or unsafe. In this context, har-
assment means physical, verbal or visual acts or behaviours.
The policy regulates harassment events that take place in the
workplace and also those that occur outside, such as during
work travel, luncheons, dinners, external visits and social
events linked to the Company's business. The policy provides
a whistle-blowing mechanism using the Enel Code of Eth-
ics channel, and adequate disciplinary actions and penalties
(commensurate with the seriousness and frequency of the
conduct), which can result in termination of employment in
the most serious cases. Also internal training and awareness
activities are planned on the subject of ethics in the work-
place, behaviours to adopt, and respect for diversity.

Enel's approach to diversity and inclusion is based on core
principles of non-discrimination, equal opportunities and equal
dignity for all forms of diversity, inclusion, and work-life bal-
ance set down in the related policy of 2015. Application of the
policy in recent years has made it possible to develop global
and local projects celebrating diversity of gender, age, nation-
ality, and abilities, and disseminating a culture of inclusion,
with awareness and communication initiatives that involved
all organisational contexts, thanks also to the commitment of
company management and of all people who, in line with the
requirements of Open Power behaviours, recognise the value
of each person regardless of individual differences.

2019 saw the production of “Inclusion Ongoing” — the edi-
tion of the D&l Days organised since 2017 — with the aim
of focusing on the concept of inclusion = value and the path
leading from the culture of inclusion to inclusive behaviours,
with the active engagement and empowerment of all. At the
same time, an awareness campaign was launched called “In-
clusiON": the name of the initiative is designed to commu-
nicate the idea that inclusion is an attitude that must be acti-
vated — switched ON — and that each individual is responsible
for assuming.

Enel has confirmed its commitment in relation to the topic of
diversity and inclusion, also through the definition of specif-
ic public targets that form part of the Sustainability Plan and
the progress of which is reported in the Sustainability Report.
These documents are analysed by the Corporate Governance
and Sustainability Committee and the Control and Risks Com-
mittee, and subsequently approved by the Board of Directors.
In 2019, the Board of Directors was given a specific training
session on the subject of disabilities at the time of Enel’s par-
ticipation in “Valuable 500”, the global initiative addressed to
500 private sector companies with the aim of providing an
outlet to express the potential of disabled personnel in the
corporate, social and economic spheres.

Gender diversity

At December 2019, women accounted for 21% of the en-
tire Group population and their presence in the initial stages
of selection processes was recorded at 42%° (39% in 2018),
in line with the goal of reaching 50% by 2022 in order to guar-
antee equal representation. Women managers have followed
an upward trend in recent years (2014: 14% vs 2019: 21%),
while women in executive roles currently total 11.1% (2 out
of 18). The 2019 equal remuneration rating - ERR manager*
concerning the managerial population is 83.7%. In general,
the trend of global equal remuneration ratings is influenced
by the different average salaries in the countries in which the
Group operates and by the incidence of newly acquired com-
panies or divested companies.

Enel carries out periodic monitoring of the presence of wom-
en in managerial positions and on salary equity, and the
2020-2022 Sustainability Plan provides for an increase in the
number of women in management and middle management
positions. In this context, Enel is committed to the develop-
ment of women for senior positions, implementing specific
management actions whose results however can only be fully
appreciated in the medium/long term, considering the effects
of the generational dynamic. In the short term, salary equity
is anyway guaranteed de facto for new appointments to man-
agerial positions, and a dedicated budget has been created
to guarantee equal pay for equal roles. Moreover, the salary

3 Blue collar workers and the US scope were excluded from the selection
pool because local regulations protecting anti-discriminatory practices
during recruiting operations prevent monitoring of this parameter.

agers / fixed + variable male managers.
