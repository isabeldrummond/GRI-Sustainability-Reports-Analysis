terest-free instalments and has specific support channels.
Finally, working with the Endesa Foundation and in collab-
oration with the Red Cross and Ecodes, Endesa has been
promoting an energy volunteering project since 2015 to
support specific vulnerable situations by providing training
on efficient consumption, personalised advice and taking
money-saving and safety measures in homes. In 2018
2019, the project benefited 2,410 households, 772 of them
in 2019. The project has been re-launched for 2020. During
2019, Endesa signed an agreement with the city of Mala-
ga to protect vulnerable families at risk of social exclusion,
making it easier for them to receive financial help from so-
cial services by trialling an innovative digital platform (Con-
ffa project).

In Romania, tailor-made solutions are constantly being
sought to meet the needs of the most vulnerable custom-
er groups. Enel has a presence in the Ferentari district of
Bucharest, one of the most disadvantaged. By appointing
a trusted person from that community, called an “energy
mediator”, Enel has been able to gain a better understand-
ing of local needs to ensure a more appropriate offer of
services. The energy mediator also helps the population
of the neighbourhood to perform seemingly simple tasks
such as reading meters, signing contracts or accompanying
local people to the Enel shop when necessary.

In Brazil, customers who rely on life-preserving elec-
tro-medical equipment have priority over other customers
on the telephone channel and their requests are monitored
and promptly supported.

In addition, Enel appropriately manages customers with
special subsidies offered by the government, such as
the “Social Electricity Tariff” (TSEE) subsidy provided for
low-income people.

In 2019, Enel promoted several initiatives that focused on
energy efficiency aimed especially at low-income custom-
ers: the replacement of fridges and lights, seminars on re-
sponsible energy use and household budgeting, inclusion
in the TSEE lists.

In Chile, Enel Distribucion Chile's “oficina movil” (mobile
office) continued to contribute to caring for the most vul-
nerable customers, bringing the company closer to their
homes.

In Peru, the “More light, more life” project aims to bring
electricity to developing areas of housing. In 2019, Enel
carried out work in 94 areas through this programme, in-
volving more than 190 thousand households and contribut-
ing to their well-being, safety and quality of life.

A transparent relationship
with customers

02-16] [ J (former EU24) |

   

In the various companies of the Enel Group, in accordance
with the Code of Ethics, all contracts, communications ad-
dressed to customers and advertising messages must be:
+ clear and simple, written in language that is as close as
possible to that normally used by the people to whom
they are addressed;
+> compliant with current regulations, without resorting to
elusive or incorrect practices;
+> complete, without neglecting any information needed
by the customer to make a decision;
+> accessible to the customer.
In all the countries where the Group operates, specific cus-
tomer service channels have been set up: physical, tele-
phone and online, to keep customers constantly informed
about the features of the products and services offered. Ac-
cess to information has also been strengthened through the
use of social media channels, such as Facebook and Twitter,
and specific apps. In order to guarantee that communica-
tion with customers is truly transparent, correct and effec-
tive, Enel undertakes to ensure that any cultural, linguistic,
illiteracy or disability barriers do not affect equal access to
information for customers. Services dedicated to deaf peo-
ple have been developed in Spain and Peru, thanks to the
collaboration with the Italian startup Pedius, which has been
operating in Italy since 2018.
In Italy, in addition to the www.enel.it website, which allows
customer relationships to be set up and maintained for com-
mercial and management purposes, there is a specific Enel
Energia app designed to manage users quickly and easily,
providing access to all the data relating to bills, usage, pay-
ment status, etc. It also allows the services associated with
the various supplies to be activated or changed, information
to be received about new offers and promotions, while also
providing access to the dedicated loyalty program.
As part of the “Enel Social Services” programme, created in
collaboration with the Prime Minister's Office, the National
Electricity Service sends the bill in Braille to blind custom-
ers. There is also a chat function for deaf customers on the
Enel Energia website (www.enel.it). Also on the Enel Ener-
gia website there is a guide with visual and audio contents
explaining the bill.
