Fuel procurement
(025) Gi

 

Suppliers of solid and liquid fuel are selected through the
“Know Your Customer” process, which evaluates each
party's reputational and financial aspects and possession
of the appropriate technical and commercial requirements.
It is also checked that the suppliers are not on any specif-
ic “Black Lists” of the United Nations, European Union or
OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control).

These are lists that identify individuals or organisations as-
sociated with terrorist associations, organisations under
EU financial sanctions, and the so-called Specially Desig-
nated Nationals (SDNs) which are subject to United States
sanctions on terrorism or drug trafficking charges amongst
others.

To assess the sustainability aspects of coal sources, an
internal process has been established to prove that the
requirements in line with the Group's standards on occu-
pational health and safety, environment and human rights
have been fulfilled.

Purchase contracts agreed with each supplier are subject
to the principles adopted by the Group with regard to the
Code of Ethics and Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan, with
which suppliers must comply. Enel reserves the right to
terminate contracts in severe cases of non-compliance
with said principles.

Lastly, to mitigate risks arising from shipping fuels, Enel
has adopted a tool to vet the carriers it uses. Vetting is
a recognised industry standard for oil transportation; but
for a few years now, Enel and an increasing number of
operators have already begun to apply this method also for
transporting bulk cargoes.
