Enel's corporate governance structure complies with the
principles set out in the Corporate Governance Code for
listed companies’, as last amended (edition July 2018), and
adopted by the Company, and is inspired by international
best practices. The corporate governance system Enel and
its Group have adopted is essentially aimed at creating value
for shareholders over the long term, taking into account the
social importance of the Group's business operations and
the consequent need to adequately consider all the interests
involved when conducting them. In accordance with Italian
legislation on listed companies, the Company's organisation
includes:
> aBoard of Directors, which is in charge of the corporate
management;
> aBoard of Auditors, which is responsible for monitoring:
(i) the Company's compliance with the law and bylaws,
as well as compliance with proper management
principles when carrying out the Company's activities;
(ii) the financial disclosure process and adequacy of
the Company's organisational structure, internal audit

system, and administration and accounting system; (iii)
the auditing of the annual and financial statements and
independence of the auditing firm; and (iv) lastly, how
the rules under the Corporate Governance Code are
actually implemented;

> the Shareholders’ Meeting, which is responsible for
passing resolution — in ordinary or extraordinary sessions
— oni: (i) the appointment or removal of members of the
Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors, as
well as their compensation and responsibilities; (ii) the
approval of financial statements and allocation of net
earnings; (iii) the purchase and sale of treasury shares;
{iv) the remuneration policy and its implementation; (v)
share-based compensation plans; (vi) amendments to
the Company's bylaws; (vii) merger and demerger oper
ations; (viii) the issue of convertible bonds.

The audit of the accounts is entrusted to a specialised firm

enrolled in the relevant registry appointed by the Sharehold-

ers’ Meeting, based on a reasoned proposal by the Board of

Statutory Auditors.
