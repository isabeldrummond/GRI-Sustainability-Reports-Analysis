complished in 2019 for the entire perimeter of Enel applica-
tions, the number of “Internet web applications protect-
ed by means of advanced cyber security solutions” has
now reached 100%.

Main collaborations with ex-
ternal bodies and agencies

In line with SDGs 9 and 17, Enel numbers activities in the
area of digitalization and innovation within activities for the
promotion of global partnerships with external bodies and
authorities, including private organisations, institutions,
academies and universities. In line with the Open Power
approach, this method makes it possible to share best prac-
tices, develop channels for sharing information and create
new standards and regulations in which Enel makes its ex-
perience available to increase the security of the ecosystem.
Active participations proceeded in 2019 with several work
groups for the definition of cyber security regulations and
standards in the electricity industry, notably in the context
of the “International Electrotechnical Commission TC57/
WG'15 - Data and Communication Security” and the “IEC
Technical Committee 57”.

There were also several collaborations with institutional
partners and participations in high-profile national and inter-
national symposia in 2019, with the aim of maintaining an
active role in the industry's international community, sharing
the Enel cyber security model and the approach employed.
In this context, Enel took part as a founder member in “The
National Observatory for Cyber Security, Resilience and
Business Continuity of Electrical Grids”, a group of experts
that acts as a focal point for innovation and research initia-
tives on critical electrical infrastructure.

Enel takes part in the World Economic Forum work groups
and, in 2019, contributed to drafting the paper entitled “Cy-
ber Resilience in the Electricity Ecosystem: Principles and
Guidance for Boards”, which aims to provide the Boards of
Directors of companies in the electricity sector with a series
of general and cross-platform principles for governance in re-
lation to cyber resilience of the electricity sector ecosystem.
Furthermore, the Group played an active role in the Conseil
de Cooperation Economique task force for cyber security in
the energy sector, in order to provide information and rec-
ommendations concerning cyber security, of use for Euro-
pean Commission initiatives.

Training
and information

The Company pressed ahead with its commitment to dis-
seminating the “cyber security culture” in 2019, staging
16 cyber security knowledge sharing events.

After the first plan launched at the end of 2015, the Cy-
ber Security Awareness Program has now become a
constant and ongoing initiative at Group level, aimed at
creating a culture of cyber security to increase awareness
of threats and attacks exploiting the human vector.

In this context, the Company proceeded with the “Hack-
ers love data. Save it.” cyber security awareness cam-
paign started in 2017 and addressed to everyone in the
Group; in the second half of 2019 two waves were ded-
icated to “Spear Phishing” and “Social Engineering” at-
tack methods.

Furthermore, 16 cyber security knowledge sharing events
were organised at Group level in 2019 and also a con-
tinuous and widespread information activity was carried
out concerning the main cyber threats (as occurred, for
example, in May 2019 after one of the world’s main in-
stant messaging systems was hacked), by means of ap-
propriate communications to all Group employees, carried
out primarily via the intranet. The Group intranet not only
disseminates news concerning cyber security matters
rapidly, but also provides access to all the relevant organ-
isational documents and technical guidelines.
