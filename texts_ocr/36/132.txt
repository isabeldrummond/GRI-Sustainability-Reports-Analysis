to repair valuable components subject to wear (turbine
blades, burner components) and redesign and make in-
novative components with complex geometries and in
special materials.

> Energy Storage — The use of storage systems produc-
es an improvement in levels of reliability and an increase
in network quality indicators. Together with traditional
generation, energy storage guarantees balancing of the
network and stability of system loads on a country-wide
level. The use of batteries is of critical importance in
supporting microgrids, especially for the network ser-
vice on minor islands.

> Green hydrogen — A community was set up in 2019 to
study applications linked to the production of hydrogen
by means of electrolysis processes powered by electric-
ity from renewable sources.

Intellectual property:
innovation driver

Intellectual property is the essential driver of innovation and
Enel has launched a specific project for its measurement
and assessment, also in order to share the impacts and gen-
erate value among the various stakeholders.

For this purpose, in liaison with a research group guided by
Roma Tre University and composed of researchers from
several academic institutions, the project involves the var-
ious Business Lines and is aimed at identifying and organis-
ing intellectual property, construed as the portfolio of intan-
gible assets created by human ingenuity (such as patents
or software). A digital platform for monitoring and evalua-
tion has also been launched, making it possible to map the
patents held by the Group for the first time and to do the

Innovation and digitalization

 

groundwork needed to gain insights and perform actions of
a strategic and organisational nature in the future.

At the end of 2019, the Group held a total of 826 patents
for industrial inventions, subject to specific normative pro-
tection, mainly concerning the Global Infrastructure & Net-
works (506 patents), Enel X (188 patents) and Global Power
Generation (132 patents) Business Lines. 83% of the pat-
ents have already completed the registration procedure,
while the remaining 17% is awaiting the result of the patent
office examination phase. On a geographical basis, the pat-
ents owned by the Group are distributed across 57 different
countries, mainly in Italy (652), then in the US (137), Brazil
(19), Spain (9) and Colombia (9).

In the framework of the Global Infrastructure & Networks
Business Line, the patents portfolio is mainly related to smart
metering systems and other technologies, resulting from a
multi-annual activity of research and development aimed
primarily at extending the functions and information acces-
sible to customers, at simplifying the remote management
of devices, optimising processes of communication with the
central systems, and preventing any tamper attempts.

The most significant patents of the Enel X Business Line
include smart charging technologies for charging points that
take into consideration system requirements, customer be-
haviour, and environmental factors (patent granted in the
US) and optimisation mechanisms for B2B customer energy
systems which, through the management of electricity con-
sumption, help to identify the ideal balance point between
economic sustainability and system efficiency (patent grant-
ed in the US and pending in Canada, Australia and South
Korea).

The Global Power Generation Business Line has developed
patents related in particular to decarbonization of the energy
mix and digitalization. Patents of special significance include,
for example: patent for hydroelectric plant application that
allows hydraulic turbine performance optimisation (patent
granted in Italy and Spain and pending in Brazil), patent for
thermoelectric plants that makes it possible to detect the
buckets closed condition automatically, thus increasing the
efficiency and safety of solids loading and unloading pro-
cesses (patent granted in Italy and pending in France and
Germany), and, for photovoltaic plants, a patent for improved
efficiency of solar cells (patent granted in Italy, with proce-
dures currently under way for extension to France, Germany
and Spain and, beyond the EU, to the US, Japan and China).
