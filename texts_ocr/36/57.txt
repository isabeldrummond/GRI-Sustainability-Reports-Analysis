Main risks and opportunities
linked to climate change

The identification, assessment
and management of risks and
opportunities

The process of defining the Group's strategy is accompa-
nied by a careful analysis of the risks and opportunities con-
nected to it, also including the aspects related to climate
change.

Every year, before approving the Strategic Plan, the Control
and Risk Committee, which is appointed by the Board of
Directors, is presented with a quantitative analysis of the
risks and opportunities related to the Group's strategic posi-
tioning, which includes aspects related to the climate, such
as regulatory factors and weather-climatic events.

Climate change and the energy transition will impact Group
activities in a variety of ways. In order to identify the main
types of risk and opportunity and their impact on the busi-
ness associated with them in a structured manner consist-
ent with the TCFD, we have adopted a framework that ex-
plicitly represents the main relationships between scenario
variables and types of risk and opportunity, specifying the
strategic and operational approaches to managing them,
comprising mitigation and adaptation measures.

There are two main macro-categories of risks/opportunities:
those connected with developments in physical variables
and those linked to the evolution of the transition scenarios.
Physical risks are divided in turn between acute (i.e. ex-
treme events) and chronic, with the former linked to ex-
tremely intense meteorological conditions and the latter to
more gradual but structural changes in climate conditions.
Extreme events expose the Group to the risk of prolonged
unavailability of assets and infrastructure, the cost of restor-
ing service, customer disruptions and so on. Chronic chang-
es in climate conditions expose the Group to other risks or
opportunities: for example, structural changes in tempera-
ture could cause changes in electricity demand and have an
impact on output, while alterations in rainfall or wind con-
ditions could impact the Group’s business by increasing or
decreasing potential electricity generation.

The energy transition towards a more sustainable model
characterised by a gradual reduction of CO, emissions has
risks and opportunities connected both with changes in the
regulatory and legal context and trends in technology devel-
opment, electrification and the consequent market devel-
opments.

Consistent with the climate and transition scenarios used by
Enel to determine risks and opportunities, the main transi-
tion-related phenomena are beginning to emerge in relation
to customer behaviour, industrial strategies being adopted
in all economic sectors and regulatory policies. Between
2020 and 2030, the transition trends will become visible in
response to the evolution of the context: the Enel Group has
decided to facilitate the transition, and is therefore ready to
seize all the opportunities that may arise from an acceler-
ation in that transition. As discussed previously, our stra-
tegic choices, which are already strongly oriented towards
the energy transition, with more than 90% of investment
dedicated to the transition, enable us to incorporate risk mit-
igation and opportunity maximisation “by design”, adopting
a positioning that takes account of the medium and long-
term phenomena we have identified. The strategic choices
are accompanied by the operating best practices adopted
by the Group.

The framework illustrated on the next page also highlights
the relationships that link the physical and transition scenari-
os with the potential impact on the Group's business. These
effects can be assessed from the perspective of three time
horizons: the short term (1-3 years), in which sensitivity
analyses based on the Strategic Plan presented to investors
in 2019 can be performed; the medium term (until 2030),
in which it is possible to assess the effects of the energy
transition; and the long terms (2030-2050), in which chronic
structural changes in the climate should begin to emerge.
The main sources of risk and opportunity identified, the best
practices for the operational management of weather and
climate phenomena, and the qualitative and quantitative im-
pact assessments performed to date are discussed below.
As declared by the TCFD, the process of disclosing informa-
tion on the risks and opportunities connected with climate
change will be gradual and incremental from year to year.
