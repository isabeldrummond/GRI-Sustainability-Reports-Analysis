Environmental risk analysis

 

In order to identify and minimise environmental risks related to

its activities, Enel, as well as adopting the ISO 14001 certified

Environmental Management Systems across every single pro-

duction site and operational unit, also uses an important analyt-

ical and intervention tool at Group level which works in synergy

across all these entities to protect the environment.

> Group Policy for the classification and analysis of
Accidental Environmental Events. Accidental Environ-
mental Events are classified according to their type and
relevance. This classification is based on their possible
impact on the environmental matrices and on any poten-
tial sensitive areas (eco-systems and protected areas),
in addition to their negative impact on the organisation
itself. The policy defines the communication procedures
for such events, analysing their causes, monitoring sub-
sequent corrective actions and improvements in accord-
ance with their classification and relevance. Rigorously
applying them across all the Group organisational activ-
ities ensures Enel’s ownership of a robust and timely
environmental control tool.

> Environmental Risk and Opportunity Assessment
Policy. Throughout 2019 and at Group level, over 1,200
environmental risk analyses were performed in as many
operational sites and Staff Functions across all the geo-
graphical areas where Enel operates, consolidating pre-
vious divisional approaches into one single model which
is a shared, organic and homogeneous analytical model.
This analysis, specifically, has ensured a more effective
identification, classification and management of risks
and opportunities both for the environment and for the
organisation. The adoption of this approach, with an in-
creased focus on the entire life cycle, involved the anal-
ysis of the processes and operational activities carried
out at each site or territorial environment. It assesses
potential interactions with the environmental matrices
as well as using controls or regulatory compliance, in-
cluding the most stringent self-imposed targets, to en-
able continuous improvement. Risk assessments were
also extended to environmental issues related to gov-
ernance and to the strategic guidelines applied from the
organisation's central Functions.

> Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) Policy. ECoS is a planning
and site visit tool used by groups of inter-departmental

174

 

experts for power stations and operational structures
in order to identify improvement plans and to share
best practices. In 2019, the Business Lines across all
the countries where the Group operates realised over
230 ECoS (between safety and environment). With a
structured approach contained in specific assessment
clusters, ECoS have analysed workplaces, control and
management systems, organisational structures and
environmental practices, in addition to health and safety
practices.

Supplier Environmental Assessment. Considering the
importance of suppliers in defining the Company's com-
plex environmental services, at the end of 2019 Enel de-
cided to adopt a structured and homogeneous supplier
environmental assessment procedure across the Group.
This supplier assessment can be implemented during
the supplier qualification phase, especially for high-risk
environmental activities requiring a minimum standard
to be qualified as an Enel supplier. However, if signifi-
cant environmental events should occur, a supplier may
undergo an extraordinary assessment for the purposes
of identifying the areas for improvement, which the sup-
plier is then required to implement, to prevent this event
from re-occurring in the future.
