Values and pillars of company ethics

The Enel Group's activities are supported by a sound
ethical foundation: its constantly evolving nature is aimed
at incorporating best practices at national and international
level. Everyone who works at Enel and for Enel must respect
and apply these practices in their daily activities. This system
is based on specific compliance programmes, such as: the
Code of Ethics, Human Rights Policy, Zero Tolerance of
Corruption Plan (ZTC Plan), Enel Global Compliance Program
(EGCP), Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01
and other national compliance models that may be adopted
by Group companies in accordance with local regulations.

Code of Ethics

In 2002, Enel adopted its Code of Ethics, which expresses

the commitments and ethical responsibilities it follows

in conducting business, by regulating and harmonising

corporate conduct according to standards based on the

utmost transparency and integrity towards all stakeholders

The Code of Ethics is valid both in Italy and abroad, while

taking into account the cultural, social and economic diversity

of the various countries where Enel operates. Specifically,

the document is divided into:

+> general principles for stakeholder relations, which define
the values that the Group uses as inspiration in carrying
out its various activities;

> criteria of conduct towards each class of stakeholders,
which provide the guidelines and standards that Enel peo-
ple are required to follow to ensure compliance with the
general principles and to prevent the risk of unethical con-
duct;

> implementation mechanisms that describe the control sys-
tem designed to ensure compliance with the Code and
its continuous improvement. Enel also requires that all
affiliates and subsidiary companies, main suppliers and
partners adopt ethical behaviour in line with the Code's
general principles.

In 2019, the Code was updated in order to incorporate

224

 

several international references on human rights and to align
the tasks of the units responsible for the update with the
current organisational structure.

Reports
by stakeholders

Any violation or suspected violation of Enel Compli-
ance Programs can be reported, including anonymously,
through a single platform at Group level (“Ethics Point”),
which is accessible at the following address: www.enel.
ethicspoint.com.

Reports can also be sent by e-mail or regular mail. The Au-
dit Function receives and analyses these reports, perform-
ing the related checks and ensuring uniform treatment at
Group level, in compliance with company policies and lo-
cal regulations

The report management process is governed by the
whistleblowing policy, “Management of anonymous and
non-anonymous reports’ which reiterates the guarantee
of anonymity and protection against any form of retalia-
tion and also ensures adequate protection against ground-
less reports made in bad faith for the purpose of harming
people and/or companies.
