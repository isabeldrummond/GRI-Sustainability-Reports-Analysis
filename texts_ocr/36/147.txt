This rate is calculated by establishing the ratio between the number of injuries (all injuries, also those with 3 days of absence or less) and hours worked/'1,000,000.
‘Sum of: injuries that resulted in more than 6 months’ absence from work as at December 31, 2019; injuries that are stil open and considered severe (initial progno-

sis > 30 days) as at December 31, 2019; injuries categorised as “Life Changing Accidents” (LCAs), regardless of the resulting days of absence from work.

The Lost Time Injuries Frequency Rate is calculated by relating the number of injuries (all accident events, also those with 3 days of absence or less) with hours

Considering all areas in which the Group operates and the activities managed, including companies consolidated using the equity method and companies for which

the BSO (Build, Sell and Operate) mechanism has been applied, the total number of fatalities is 8.

The injuries frequency rate (FR) combined for Enel people and
contractors in 2019 confirmed the downward trend already re-
corded in prior years, with a total of 0.73 injuries per million
hours worked, a figure that is 18.2% lower than that of 2018.
In detail, the FR of Enel people decreased, totalling 0.90 in-
juries per one million hours worked (-5% versus 2018), and
also that of contractor personnel, totalling 0.65 injuries per
one million hours worked (-25% versus 2018), thus confirm-
ing the effectiveness of the strategies adopted and of the
safety policies implemented in the Group.

In 2019 there was 1 fatality involving an employee of the
Enel Group (Spain) and 6 fatalities involving contractors (2 in
Brazil, 2 in Chile, 1 in Italy and 1 in Romania ). The causes are
mainly of mechanical type.

In 2019 there were 3 High Consequence injuries involving Enel
Group employees (2 in Italy and 1 in Russia) and 16 involving
contractors (5 in Italy, 2 in Spain, 2 in Peru, 2 in Mexico, 1 in
USA, 3 in Brazil and 1 in Argentina ), mainly of mechanical type.
Enel has a specific injuries management policy (Policy 106
“Classification, communication, analysis and reporting of
incidents") that defines roles and methods employed to
guarantee prompt communication of incidents, ensuring the
related causes analysis process, definition of improvement

146

plans, and monitoring of the associated actions depending
on the event type.

The criteria prescribed by Policy 106 are applicable not only
to injuries of high industrial significance but also to minor
events, including those not involving personal injuries (near
misses). Therefore, all fatalities or severe injuries (or events
that could have potentially caused a fatal or severe injury)
involving Enel people or the personnel of contractor compa-
nies are analysed by a group of experts. The improvement
actions identified are constantly monitored and followed
until the time of completion. If the event analysis reveals
serious safety breaches by contractor companies, suitable
provisions are adopted (contract termination, suspension of
qualification, etc.).

In addition, the Extra Checking on Site (ECoS) activity pro-
ceeded in 2019 with 230 ECoS carried out, in line with the
150 planned. The purpose of the ECoS is to assess adequacy
of the organisation and processes implemented in a specif-
ic operational area. These checks are carried out by expert
HSEQ personnel external to the operating units affected by
the investigation, assisted by technical profiles specific to
the business, and they make it possible to define adequately
monitored corrective actions for preventive purposes.
