zon's cloud-hosted smart voice service, is designed to offer
maximum ease of use. Using the voice commands, you can
ask Alexa to increase or decrease the temperature of the
apartment, set reminders for daily activities, ask for informa-
tion about electricity and gas bills, provide updates on traffic
conditions, weather or access to Amazon Music.

Finally, as part of the development of electric mobility solu-
tions suitable for all types of customers, Endesa has con-
tinued to establish agreements with large companies to
promote the use of electric mobility for their vehicles. For
example, Endesa X and Pascual have reached an agree-
ment for the installation of 76 charging points between the
company's 27 sales offices, the 6 factories and the central
offices located in Madrid; as well as for use of the public
charging infrastructure, managed by this company across
the country. This project aims to achieve a 20% reduction in
CO, by the end of 2020.

In Italy, the “Piano Italia” project to promote the electrifica-
tion of mobility and sustainable transport is intended to plan
and install a network of 28,000 charging points for electric
vehicles by 2023.

Also Italian is the “Energy efficiency for condominiums”
project of Enel X, aimed at all centrally heated condomini-
ums of more than eight units that are interested in carrying
out energy redevelopment and efficiency work on the com-

Set up in 2017 with the aim of guiding the transformation

of the energy sector by providing value-added services for

customers, Enel X operates according to an open strategy

based on digitalization, sustainability and innovation and acts

as a circularity accelerator, both with its suppliers and cus-

tomers and on the market. In particular, Enel X:

> involves customers, commercial and industrial, in the
energy transition, allowing them to save costs and mon-
etise their flexibility by offering sustainable and innova-
tive solutions;

> supports the electrification of cities and energy efficien-
cy, creating an ecosystem of digitalized infrastructure

mon parts of the building. In 2019, the new “Ore FREE” of-
fer was also launched, which further contributed to ensuring
the centrality of the customer in the offer of Enel Energia
services. With Ore FREE, customers use only energy from
renewable sources for their household consumption and can
choose the time slot in which to take advantage of three
hours of free energy. This important change is the first step
towards achieving more responsible consumption and great-
er attention to increasingly sustainable behaviour thanks to
the new open meter services.

In Brazil, numerous energy efficiency projects have been
launched to improve people’s awareness of energy con-
sumption, promoting the replacement of obsolete electrical
equipment (fridges, freezers, lighting), with a significant im-
pact on energy consumption and on improving energy effi-
ciency in homes. In 2019, around 267,000 customers ben-
efited from educational projects on responsible energy use.
Mobile units equipped with an explanatory model showing
how energy is generated, transmitted and distributed trav-

and simulate different types of energy use with fun activi-

homes for a year.

A model that allows urban ecosystems to be connected with
industrial districts and production chains, mobility needs and
individuals. Many different connections are made: distribu-
tion systems and energy storage batteries, smart lighting
solutions and low-energy LEDs, electric mobility and fast
charging services, tools for the smart management of ener-
gy and equipment in houses, buildings and cities, software
to control energy exchanges in distributed self-production
systems (demand management & response).
