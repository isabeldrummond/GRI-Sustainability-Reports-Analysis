towards ambitious climate objectives. Coordination is also
guaranteed with the various company areas and the differ-
ent countries of the Group in order to ensure that all of the
regulatory processes in which the company is asked to par-
ticipate, on a European and national level, will be fully in line
with Enel’s strategy towards the promotion of a low carbon
energy model and the electrification of energy demand.

Enel welcomes the various climate policies and regulatory
measures announced and implemented in 2019 in the var-
ious geographical areas where it operates, in particular in
Europe. For this reason, the company considers the Green
New Deal presented by the European Commission as a
great opportunity for accelerating the European Union's path
towards a decarbonized and sustainable economy, which in
turn will bring business opportunities that are in line with the
Group's strategy and sustainable business model.

During 2019, Enel also actively participated in public consul-
tations, meetings, conferences, workshops and events con-
cerning the four measures published as part of the Clean
Energy Package. It welcomes the recognition of energy ef-
ficiency as a key pillar towards the transmission to low car-
bon emissions energy and contributes towards establishing
areliable system for increasing the renewables and meeting
the challenges of the future electric energy markets in an
efficient manner in terms of costs and promoting coopera-
tion among Member States. The fixed objectives will stim-
ulate Europe's industrial competitiveness, boost renewable
energies, create new jobs, reduce energy bills, contribute
towards facing energy poverty and improve air quality.

Enel is also working together with the governments and
stakeholders in Europe, Latin America and Africa to devel-
op an energy transition roadmap with an open approach,
sharing policy design and technical knowledge to contrib-
ute towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
Their development typically involves four main activities: a)
greenhouse gas scenarios for 2050, developing technologi-
cal mixes on an economic level and corresponding emission
profiles in line with the objectives of decarbonization and the
national circumstances; b) greenhouse gas emission scenar-
ios for 2030 that identify intermediate objectives in line with
the 2050 scenarios and outline the trajectories to follow to
reach the long-term decarbonization objectives; c) political
recommendations targeted towards creating a political and
regulatory context that is favourable for the investments
necessary for an efficient energy transition and for reach-
ing the 2030 and 2050 objectives; d) dialogues between the
concerned parties that enable participation with the institu-

tions, the NGOs and other operations in an open exchange
regarding the most critical issues to guarantee the success
of the energy transitions.

Enel's position on carbon pricing

Enel believes that the “cap and trade” system is the most
efficient method for reducing emissions, especially in indus-
trialised economies. The definition of an absolute emissions
objective guarantees the efficiency in reaching the environ-
mental objective, whereas the signal of the price fixed by the
market guarantees economic efficiency and minimisation of
costs. In general, Enel believes that the institution of a “cap
and trade” system that is based on a solid regulatory frame-
work guarantees the certainty of long-term climatic objec-
tives and permits market mechanisms to determine prices
that are coherent with the macroeconomic cycles and with
market conditions. Instead, environmental taxation works
well for countries with a weaker institutional framework and
for sectors with distributed sources of emissions. The de-
bate regarding the suitability of “cap and trade” or a carbon
tax must be developed from a multitude of prospectives,
balancing the cost-effectiveness of policy instruments with
technical and political feasibility. The selection of the policy
option should also include an evaluation of the sectors that
must be covered by the system as well as an assessment of
the current policy framework.

Therefore, Enel recognises the role of EU ETS in providing
a suitable price signal associated with CO, emissions in the
