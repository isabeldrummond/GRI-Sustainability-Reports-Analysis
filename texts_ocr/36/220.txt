country and global level are set up, with recurring meetings
between all of the Group's Tax Managers in order to ensure
the appropriate alignment.

Tax risks

The Group has a Tax Control Framework (TCF) whose main
aim is to provide the Tax units with a single and consistent
set of guidance for adopting a correct and effective approach
to tax risk management within the Group. The framework
sets out guidelines and methodological rules so as to
consistently assess, monitor and manage the relevant
tax risk for the Group companies, in accordance with the
principles and guidelines set out by the tax strategy, and
in the awareness that the Group companies operating in
different jurisdictions must adopt the TCF with respect for
the specific societal context and domestic regulations of
the individual countries in question. In accordance with the
principles and guidelines set out in the tax strategy, the Enel
Group aims to proactively manage the tax risk and believes
that adopting aTCF can ensure the timely detection, correct
measurement and control of the risk tax. The task of the
TCF is to identify the sources of tax risk for the purpose of
compliance and interpreting tax regulations, while mapping
out the respective processes and activities in order to forma
network of risk detectors, to be associated with the resulting
control measures. In particular, as the set of detectors and
control measures identify sources of risk, the TCF can provide

a broad spectrum of control. As such, any materialisation of
the tax risk can be intercepted and managed by each relevant
Tax unit. The effectiveness and ongoing updates of the TCF
are ensured through periodic monitoring of the risk mapping,
regular internal audit processes, as well as through the tax
authority systems set out under cooperative compliance
regimes (where implemented).

Mechanism for reports
by stakeholders

For the Enel Group, tax compliance is considered a key aspect
of the Company's ethical and responsible management.
As such, the violations that can be reported through the
Company's internal channels also include those relating to
tax. The Group's Code of Ethics is the framework of “ethical
management” which Enel operates, also tying in fully with
the tax strategy. There are appropriate provisions on Code of
Ethics violations to ensure its effective implementation, and
these requirements must also be considered to cover the
provisions of the tax strategy.
