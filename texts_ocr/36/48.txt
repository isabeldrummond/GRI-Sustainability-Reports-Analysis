1 Includes the electricity production from renewable and nuclear sources.
2 The GHG Protocol requires considering the consumption of electricity when calculating the Company's carbon footprint as indirect emissions (Scope 2)

3 Includes the contribution of the "Global Power Generation” Business Line.

4 Other Scope 1 emissions are equal to 0.4 mil t CO,. See the paragraph “Greenhouse gas emissions” for further details.

5 SAIFI, System Average Interruption Frequency Index.

6 Other Scope 2 emissions are equal to 1.5 mil t CO, (according to location-based methodology). See the paragraph Greenhouse gas emissions” for further details.
