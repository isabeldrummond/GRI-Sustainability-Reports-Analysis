Enel manages relations with its suppliers in a fair, trans-

parent and collaborative way, promoting long-term partner

ships. A global strategy with the aim of maximising value

creation in its various forms (security, savings, time, quality,

performance, revenue, flexibility, risk reduction) and improv-

ing stakeholders’ end-to-end experience. The transformation

that has been ongoing in recent years is based on:

> expanding the professionalism of buyers through us-
erfriendly technologies and by recognising everyone's
contribution in a multicultural trust-based working envi-
ronment driven by passion;

> enhance integration and communication with internal
customers, setting out together solutions to fulfil the
business’ needs;

+> involving suppliers from the moment the need comes
about, listening to their proposals and developing inno-
vative approaches together.

In 2019, Enel set out specific procedures to adopt new

methods such as “Design to Value’ which aims to establish

innovative solutions in close collaboration with suppliers

with an approach that's open to change, and “Should Cost”

to develop quantitative analyses and support negotiations

between buyers and suppliers.

Procurement processes are carried out in compliance with the

applicable local laws, ensuring the quality of service in full com-

pliance with the principles of economy, efficiency, timeliness

Sustainable supply chain

 

and fairness. Every procurement procedure is aimed at guar
anteeing the principles of free competition, equal treatment,
non-discrimination, transparency, proportionality, rotation, and
public access. Moreover, the economic principle may be sub-
ject to criteria laid down by the tender, inspired by social de-
mands, as well as protecting health and the environment and
promoting sustainable development and social stability.

In terms of environmental sustainability and reducing paper
usage, the Groupis promoting digital processes with its sup-
pliers for qualification/registration, tender management and
issuing contracts.

Enel carries out structured analyses and monitoring of the
procurement process. In particular, it conducts a risk assess-
ment on 100% of the procurement merchandise categories.
The main identified risks concern economic, environmental,
social and reputational aspects.

95% of Tier 1 suppliers (approximately 10,000 suppliers")
were considered “critical suppliers” based on their strategic
nature related to the business, purchase volumes and poten-
tial economic, social and environmental impacts.

The Enel Group's relations with its suppliers undergo basic
steps to ensure that the best partners are selected and that
contracts are executed to the highest sustainability stand-
ards.

1. “Tier 1" suppliers are those with active contracts as of December 31, 2019
of more than 25 thousand euros.
