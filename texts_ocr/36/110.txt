The essential lever to carry out these projects is the recourse
to around 800 partnerships with organisations, companies,
and institutions operating at the local and international level
that promote development of the territory through tailored
interventions.

The sustainability of the strategy is also confirmed by the
progress made in terms of the Group's contribution to the
achievement of the SDGs. During 2015-2019, the Group ob-
tained the following results?:

+> SDG 4 -projects supported to guarantee inclusive and
equitable quality education, which involved 1.3 million

beneficiaries (6.3 million during 2015-2018);

+> SDG 8 - promoted sustained, inclusive and sustainable

lion beneficiaries (1.8 million during 2015-2018).
