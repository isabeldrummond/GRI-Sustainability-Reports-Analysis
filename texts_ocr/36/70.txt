Even if Enel constantly monitors Scope 2 emissions and is
actively committed to their reduction, the Group has not set
a specific reduction target, as they represent less than 4%
of the total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2017 (base
year of reference for new emission reduction targets an-
nounced in 2019). Therefore they are considered marginal
and fall within the criteria of exclusion according to the SBTi
methodology, which fixes a margin of 5% of total Scope
1 and Scope 2 emissions. Furthermore, the Scope 2 emis-
sions, being connected to specific emissions per country,
are estimated as being decreasing progressively, as the gen-
eration mix in countries in which Enel is present are chang-
ing following the increase in electricity production from re-
newable sources.

Financial, operational
and environmental metrics

Financial metrics

The main metrics and the financial objectives used to
measure and manage the risks and opportunities related
to climate change are presented below. In 2019, Enel's
EBITDA associated with low carbon emissions technolo-

gies, services and solutions was equal to 1.62 billion eu-
ros, with a growth of 10.7% in comparison to 2018. This
results from greater renewable capacity, the expansion of
the grids and the growth of final users. Furthermore, the
Capex technologies, services and solutions with low car-
bon emissions has grown approximately 17.5% as com-
pared to 2018, reaching 9.1 billion euros, equal to 92% of
total Capex.

Revenues from coal-fired power plants, following the
company’s strategic decisions that have inspired a sus-
tainable business model that pursues, among others, the
objectives of fighting climate change and decarbonization,
are continuing to decrease. In particular, in 2019 revenues
related to coal-fired power plants amounted to 2.8 billion
euros (a 30.8% decrease as compared to 2018), equal to
3.5% of the Group's total revenues. Furthermore, total
revenues from thermal generation (coal, oil & gas and
CCGT) represent 12.8% of total revenues, equalling 10.3
billion euros (a 5.5% decrease as compared to 2018).
The “General Purpose SDG-linked bond”, which Enel
launched on the US and European stock market, included
specific targets related to the installed renewable capac-
ity ratio and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,
while contributed towards reaching 22% of the debt relat-
ed to the sustainability objectives.

1 The 2018 data regarding EBITDA and Capex were reclassified due to a change to the calculation methodology for those metrics in comparison to low-carbon

products and services.

2. The “low-carbon products, services and technologies” category considers the Enel Green Power, Infrastructure and Networks, Enel X and Market Business

Lines (excluding the sale of gas)

3. The value was calculated considering the impact of the financial instruments, which include sustainability criteria for the entire gross debt.
