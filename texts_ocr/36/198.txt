Relations with shareholders and the financial community

Since the listing of its shares on the Stock Exchange, Enel has deemed it appropriate to set up corporate structures

dedicated to dialogue with institutional investors and with the majority of shareholders. As such, the Company set

up: (i) the Investor Relations unit, currently within the Administration, Finance and Control Function; (ii) an area in the

Corporate Affairs Unit, which is in turn part of the Legal and Corporate Affairs Function. In this context, Enel maintains

dialogue with investors based on the principles of fairness and transparency, in compliance with EU and national

regulations on market abuse, as well as in line with international best practices. Among other things, the Investor

Relations unit draws up Enel's “equity story” and organises meetings between the Company's top management and ES
institutional investors and financial analysts. It also oversees the documentation to be submitted to the latter when
disclosing periodic financial data to the market and updating of the Group's Strategic Plan as part of Capital Markets Day.
This is accompanied by ordinary activities, which include group or individual meetings, conference calls and interaction
with financial analysts, with the aim of supporting them in their analysis and, lastly, facilitating the correct assessment
of the Company by the financial community. The Investor Relations unit — with the support of the Innovability Function
—also discusses environmental, social and governance (“ESG") issues with investors, topics which can have major
financial repercussions in the medium and long term. Moreover, Enel’s website (www.enel.com, “Investors” section)
contains economic, financial, environmental, social and governance information and updated data and documents of
particular interest, providing a multidisciplinary and integrated vision.

Capital Markets Day 2019

Capital Markets Day 2019 has proven to be a sustainable event, in line with the Group's business model, centred on
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through the Resex Rio PretoJacundé REDD+ project,
created by the Brazilian company Biofilica, Enel contributed to the conservation of the Amazon rainforest, the largest
tropical forest in the world and one of the main sources of oxygen on the planet. This way it has been possible to offset
the CO, emissions caused by the main financial marketing events of the last year. Further details can be found in the
“Investors” section of the website www.enel.com
