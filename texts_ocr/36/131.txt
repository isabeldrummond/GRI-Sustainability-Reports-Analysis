The culture of Innovability

In 2019 Enel opened a new Idea Hub in Peru, thus strength-
ening the promotion and development of a culture of innova-
tion and entrepreneurship within the Company, with 6 Idea
Hubs already present in Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Italy, Iberia
and Romania. 2019 saw the continuation of the “Innova-
tion Academy” training project launched in 2017 in order to
provide Enel people with skills and know-how on innovative
working methods and provide soft skills training. The themat-
ic areas addressed were creativity, development of ideas, col-
laboration, emotional intelligence, customer focus and listen-
ing in order to drive change starting from individuals. In 2019
the Academy operated in Italy, Spain, Chile, Colombia and
Brazil with part of the courses delivered by internal tutors and
with the participation of the Idea Hubs and Innovation Ambas-
sadors. The Innovation Ambassadors project, launched in
2018, has been expanded and upgraded by bringing in more
than 200 Enel people from various Functions and company
areas in Italy, Brazil, Chile and Colombia, in order to make in-
novation an integral part of daily activities by means of spe-
cific working methods. Ongoing initiatives also include the
“MAKE IT HAPPEN!” entrepreneurship programme, created
to allow Enel business people to emerge, with the opportu-
nity to propose and develop new business models or internal
improvement projects able to create value for the Company.
110 project proposals were submitted in 2019, of which 62
in the planning phase, one in the acceleration phase, and two
in the implementation phase, with the involvement of more
than 300 people in 11 countries.

Innovation Communities

Energy storage, blockchains, drones, augmented and vir-

tual reality, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, wearables,

robotics and green hydrogen are just some of the tech-
nologies addressed by the innovation communities, which
involve various areas and skills within the Company.

+ Drones - The use of drones continued also in 2019 in
activities of asset monitoring and maintenance, inspect-
ing solar energy fields, wind farms, hydroelectric dams
and reservoirs, closed components in traditional plants
and electricity distribution networks with the aim of
boosting the efficiency of operating, maintenance and
functional processes and, especially, reducing work-
ers risk exposure. The community also works actively

130

alongside the Italian regulatory bodies to support the
development of civil aviation regulations applicable to
drones.

Augmented reality devices and wearables — Enel is
active in collaboration and trials for spectacles and devic-
es to assist with various work activities, and innovative
methods for virtual meetings and new forms of remote
collaboration. Wearables are mainly applied for worker
safety, such as sensors to check correct use of personal
protective equipment, to track personnel on job sites
to avoid interference, and devices to help people carry
out their work in “hands free” mode, without having to
interact with potential sources of distraction including
smartphones and paper documentation. The latest ap-
plications include safety jackets and thermal clothing,
and applications are currently being studied for tracking
stress and health indicators.

Robotics — Robotic systems are equipped with inno-
vative sensors and enormous capacity for data man-
agement, processing and transmission, thus becoming
ever more versatile and reliable. Enel is extending the
adoption of Exoskeleton technology to reduce the
muscular effort required for heavy work, and Remotely
Operated Vehicles (ROV) used for inspection and main-
tenance of plants (solar and hydroelectric).

Artificial intelligence — The community includes vari-
ous data scientists, is the most numerous, and covers

 

a vast range of applications on safety processes, video
analysis, machine learning and deep learning for classifi-
cation, fault detection, predictive maintenance and virtu-
al assistants. Enel is applying more than 40 digitalization
and artificial intelligence technologies to manage South
American electricity networks for the first time. The in-
itiative includes the development of a 3D replica of the
Vila Olimpia electricity grid, plus installation of around
4,900 sensors to collect network performance data
Network Digital Twin® technologies, which include
more than 170 initiatives and new collaborations and
24 partners, will allow remote access in real time, im-
proving operation of the Enel network and hence the
service quality supplied to customers in the region.

Additive manufacturing by means of 3D printing —
Additive manufacturing of mechanical components can
benefit from the new Direct Energy Machines Addi-
tive printer, which was installed this year in the Santa
Barbara facility. Together with laser scanners and ma-
terials testing laboratories, the 3D printer allows Enel
