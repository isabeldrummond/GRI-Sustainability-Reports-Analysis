that include: develop of infrastructures, development of edu-
cation, health care, development of services, poverty, social
services, land ownership and protection of cultural heritage.
Furthermore, an Environmental Social Impact Assessment
(ESIA) was carried out in compliance with the standards of
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and with the guide-
lines of the European Bank, for investments in the Midelt pro-
ject, which is being carried out for the Boujdour project and
will be developed for the remaining projects.

ONEE (Office National de I'Electricité et de I'Eau Potable) car-
ried out a process of consultation with various stakeholders,
with the involvement of the Enel Green Power-Nareva con-
sortium in Midelt, Boujdour and Jbel Lahdid. At the end of
each consultation, a question and answer session was held.
The process of analysing the project impacts and benefits will
guide the definition and adopting of the Sustainability Plan for
each project.

Enel Green Power operates in full compliance with the laws
applicable to the investment in question. This investment
does not involve extraction activities, and the use of local re-
newable resources will support the social, economic and en-
vironmental development of the various areas involved. The
investment also complies with the principles adopted by the
international community concerning environmental protection
and the reduction of emissions from coal. In all of the areas in-
volved in the projects, the consortium will carry out a second
SEECA, also to identify any updates to the analyses that were
carried out previously. The actions and projects identified by
the analyses will be developed when the plant is in opera-
tion. However, starting from the project development phase,
the consortium will also implement sustainability activities to
mitigate the environmental impacts, in particular as concerns
water, emissions and waste, by creating a sustainable con-
struction site. The impacts on local social and employment
aspects will also be managed through the requirements of
technical specifications during every tender phase prior to the
construction of the plant, and will be monitored as a result.
For the Midelt plant, the financial close took place on Novem-
ber 5, 2018, and the construction phase started in December
2018 and will end in November 2020. The Midelt construc-
tion site has been constructed according to the model of a
sustainable construction site. It is creating positive impacts on
local communities in terms of employment and the training/
transfer of skills: 300 workers, selected from local commu-
nities, were trained and employed by contractors and active
local SMBs, for example in the transport, hotel, restaurant and
cleaning sectors.

Community and shared value

Furthermore, the environmental impacts were measured
and therefore mitigated by adopting virtuous solutions and
actions regarding emissions, water consumption and waste.
The main solutions that were implemented are indicated be-
low:

+> CO, emissions: photovoltaic mini-grid to power the base
camp and auxiliary services; generation of photovolta-
ic energy integrated with batteries used to power the
turbine monitoring phase, autonomous photovoltaic
modules to power prefabricated buildings/containers at
the base camp; street lights powered by photovoltaic
plants;

+ the use of water, encouraging recycling: the construc-
tion of small dams for rain water and water collection
systems with tanks on trucks; the reuse of rain water
for the production of concrete, while avoiding pollution
due to dust; restoration of the drilling well used by the
community and installation of a pumping system via a
photovoltaic system; installation of the water treatment
system;

> use of materials and recycling: crushing and reuse of
100% of the excavation materials originating from
works during construction to improve the conditions of
the roads and hillsides, and to create new access roads
and bridges used also by the community; recycling of
waste water using a septic tank; recycling waste deriv-
ing from liquid oil, recycling of the utilised wood pallets
to create signs at the site.

Further actions will be implemented during the construction
phase in Midelt during 2020, and a second SEECA was al-
ready started at the site in order to update the issues that
emerged during the first analysis and develop specific sus-
tainability projects during the O&M (Operation and Mainte-
nance) phase.
As regards the Boujdour project, the consortium has start-
ed the preliminary activities in view of the construction that
will start during the second half of 2020. The sustainability
actions applied to Midelt will be replicated also at Boujdour,
including the actions for supporting the creation of jobs for
the local community and the use of local SMBs.
