Company and by the combustion of diesel in the auxiliary
motors used in renewable (hydroelectric) and nuclear tech-
nologies, as well as the distribution of electricity. The com-
bustion processes from fossil fuels also include the genera-
tion of N,O (GWP=265) and CH, (GWP=28) expressed as a
CO, equivalent. These values were recalculated also for the
two previous years.

Other direct CO, equivalent emissions originated from the
leakage to the atmosphere of SF, (GVVP=23,500) which
occurs mainly within the scope of electricity distribution and,
secondarily in energy power plants. SF, is used in high and me-
dium voltage electrical equipment due to its capacity to isolate
and extinguish electric arcs and as of today it is irreplaceable for
these applications. The quantities released to the atmosphere
in 2019 as related to the entire perimeter of the Group amount
‘to 8,367 kg, which equals 197 thousand t of CO, equivalent. In
percentage terms, SF, contributes towards 0.28% of Scope 1
emissions, which represents an extremely limited amount. As
regards Scope 1, Enel considers the emissions of leakage to
the atmosphere of gases and mixtures containing greenhouse
gas that were calculated by applying the average global warm-
ing potential value of the family gases.

Scope 2 emissions

Scope 2 emissions concern the indirect emissions deriv-
ing from the generation of the electricity purchased and
consumed by the Company. Scope 2 includes the CO,
emissions associated with electricity consumption taken
from the electricity network for civil uses or for the gener-
ation of energy in thermoelectric and hydroelectric plants.
Since 2016, all supplies of electricity for the offices and Ital-
ian power plants come from renewable sources. This supply
includes the issue of green certificates by the competent
authority. The calculation of Scope 2 for the consumption of
energy taken from the network is reported according to two
points of view, one is location based, equal to 1.55 mil ty
and the other is market based, equal to 2.30 mil tg

In compliance with the GHG protocol, this category includes the
indirect emissions deriving from technical losses from Enel's
distribution network and the transmission network of the elec-
tricity system in which the Group operates, calculated for all
countries of operation for 2017-2019. The emissions caused
by the losses were calculated based on the part of energy that
exceeds the quota produced in the considered country, to avoid
the double accounting of emissions already included in Scope
1. An additional division was made for the fraction distributed

and sold in the retail market by Enel and for the share distribut-
ed on behalf of other market competitors. These losses, as for
Scope 2 for Enel’s distribution and transmission network, were
calculated based on the market share exceeding generation. In
2019, the total value of Scope 2 for distribution and transmission
grid losses equalled approximately 3.8 mil 1a {according to the
location-based methodology).

Scope 3 emissions

Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in
Scope 2) that occur in Enel’s entire value chain, from gener-
ation and transport to the sale of energy. They do not derive
from controlled or owned sources.

With reference to the power generation business, an esti-
mation was made of the fugitive emissions of methane from
coal mining during extraction as well as emissions from the
transport of the utilised fuels (coal and diesel) for the opera-
tion of its plants.

In 2019, Enel expanded the categories used to account for
Scope 3 emissions and has recalculated the 2018 and 2017
values for its entire operational perimeter during those two
years. As a result, a calculation is provided for the emissions
related to the gas and electricity retail market in Europe and
the electricity retail market in Latin America generated as a
consequence of the use of sold products (electricity and gas)
by end customers. The Group has assessed that for the gas in
the European market, this value is approximately 23.9 mil t,,,
and that the value of emissions produced by the consumption
of electricity by its customers is approximately 29.0 mil t,,.

CO, reduction targets

The Group's ambition for leadership in the fight against cli-
mate change was further strengthened in 2019: the target for
the reduction of direct emissions from electricity production
by 2020, which was set in 2015 at 350 g/kWh,, of CO,, with a
25% reduction compared with 2007, was achieved one year
early. In fact, 2019 closed with a reduction of 37%, to 296 g/
kWh,, of CO,. This target has been certified by the Science
Based Target Initiative (SBTi) as consistent with the 2DS sce-
nario (2-Degree Scenario) of the International Energy Agency
(IEA), which defines an energy system development path and
an emissions trajectory consistent with at least 50% chance
of limiting the average global temperature rise to 2 °C in 2100.
As a result, the reduction target for 2020 has been upgraded
in the new 2020-2022 Strategic Plan to 254 g/kWh,, of CO,.
