MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND MITIGATION ACTIONS

 

 

Risks connected
with
digitalization,

IT effectiveness

and service
continuity

The Group is carrying out a complete digital transformation
of how it manages the entire energy value chain, developing
new business models and digitalizing its business processes. A
consequence of this digital transformation is that the Group is
increasingly exposed to risks related to the functioning of the IT
systems implemented throughout the Company, which could
lead to service interruptions or data losses.

These risks are managed using a series of internal measures
developed by the Global Digital Solutions (GDS) unit, which is
responsible for guiding the Group's digital transformation. It
has set up an internal control system that introduces control
points along the entire IT value chain, enabling it to prevent the
emergence of risks relating to such issues as the creation of
services that do not meet business needs, the failure to imple-
ment adequate security measures and service interruptions.
The internal control system of the Global Digital Solutions unit
oversees both the activities performed in-house and those out
sourced to external associates and service providers. Further
more, Enel is promoting the dissemination of a digital culture
and digital skills within the Group in order to successfully guide
the digital transformation and minimize the associated risks.

in the chapter "Innovation and digitalization”

 

Risks connected
with the
protection of
personal data

The collection and processing of personal data represents one
of the biggest challenges in the era of digitalization and global-
ization of markets. The Group has taken up this challenge by ac-
celerating the digital transformation process while it is experi-
encing an important stage of global growth in terms of number
of customers and geographical areas. This implies an exposure
to the risks connected with the protection of personal data, an
issue that must also take account of the substantial growth
in privacy legislation, whose inappropriate implementation can
cause economic or financial losses and reputational harm.

In order to manage and mitigate this risk, Enel has adopted
a structure aimed at guaranteeing that protection of personal
data, relating to all persons with whom it interacts, is fully en-
sured. This due to the appointment of Data Protection Officers
("DPOs"), who are responsible for supporting the business ar
eas in the adoption of a “privacy by design” approach, in which
the protection of personal data a key element of the design of
any initiative or business process.

Compliance
risks

Enel may be exposed to the risk of judicial measures or admin-
istrative sanctions, economic or financial losses and reputation-
al damage as a result of:

> unlawful conduct, including acts of corruption, by internal
staff to obtain an unfair or unlawful benefit. External staff
of suppliers of Enel Group companies, commit to comply
with the ethical clauses set out in their respective contracts,
which refer to Enel’s commitment to business integrity in
conducting its activities;

> the violation of international or national laws relating to an-
titrust, market disclosures, financial, tax or other applicable
legislation (such as permitting, purchasing rules, electricity
market regulation).

Enel has adopted an Internal Control and Risk Management
System set out in the company rules and procedures which
all those who work at Enel or for Enel are required to follow
through their respective contractual commitments. The Internal
Control System also includes specific compliance programs,
such as: the Code of Ethics, the Zero Tolerance of Corruption
Plan ("ZTC Plan"), the Human Rights Policy, the Enel Global
Compliance Program ("EGCP"), the Model pursuant to Legisla-
tive Decree 231/01 and other national compliance programmes
adopted by the Group companies in compliance with national
regulations (for example, in Spain, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Peru,
Argentina and Mexico).

Furthermore, to further pursue its commitment to fighting
corruption, Enel voluntarily decided to certify its Anti-Bribery
Management System (SGPC) in compliance with the require-
ments of international standard ISO 37001 :2016 on anti-bribery
management systems. This certification process involved the
Group's main foreign subsidiaries.

The ongoing monitoring of regulatory developments at national
and international level is ensured thanks to the operations of
the relevant company Functions.
