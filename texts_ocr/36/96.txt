accelerate agile transformation in Enel. In addition, onboarding
initiatives have been carried out together with communication
campaigns designed to disseminate the agile culture and to
engage people. Job change has been promoted to allow peo-
ple to open up to new possibilities and challenges, facilitating
cross-fertilisation at all levels and diversification of competenc-
es, and to bring aptitudes to bear in different contexts, creat-
ing increasingly horizontal and complete professional profiles.
30,000 hours were dedicated to mentoring and shadowing
activities in 2019, in order to exchange experiences, acquire
different outlooks, expand competences, and strengthen the
network of relationships, with more than 4 thousand individ-
uals engaged in coaching activities since 2017. In the past
year the shadowing project was further extended to involve

all Group managers worldwide and thereafter white collar staff
of the main metropolitan sites in a peer2peer experience to
gain familiarity with new organisational contexts, experiment
with new activities and extend their network. Also promoted
was the voluntary participation “I-coach” initiative designed to
disseminate the coaching and feedback culture that supports
the Open Power transformation, stimulating the capacity of a
personal vision, of coaching towards new objectives and chal-
lenges, of improvement and self-development. The course
is delivered by certified Enel coaches who share their skills,
applying all their passion for serving others. Each course day
consists of an alternation of practical and theoretical sessions.
Finally, in the 2018-2019 period around 545 thousand feedback
messages were exchanged

Our pillars

Enel has taken action to deal with the emergency linked to the spread of Coronavirus (Covid-19), also to support the
countries in which it works. Smart working was immediately implemented for around 50% of staff, protecting their
health and guaranteeing business continuity, and a specific task force has been set up with the aim of monitoring the ~
phenomena, defining suitable actions and sharing experience across the various countries.
A dedicated section has been created on the company intranet with useful information, advice and materials. Specif- =
ically, the new section contains recommendations for prevention and behaviours to adopt together with information
concerning work in the field (preventive and protective measures, how to don disposable gloves, how to use face
masks, and travel permit forms) and digital working, also with a focus on the prevention of cyber fraud.

Also, the eDucation global platform contains the following sections, which are updated on a daily basis with new
learning contents:

+ ‘Lavorare insieme”, coaching pills, advice and suggestions to use IT tools and equipment to their best advantage;
> ‘Informarsi", support for smart working activities;

> “Rigenerarsi”, tutorials on the subject of personal and family well-being.

In addition, Enel has asked its people for ideas on how the Company could contribute to facing and overcoming the
emergency in Italy in the optimal manner. There is no restriction on the areas of application and type of resources to xz
use, internal or external, although solutions must be practical, realistic and rapidly implementable. 2

 

Enel people in the world

As of December 31, 2019 the Enel Group employed 68,253
people (down by 1,019 with respect to the end of 2018).
The reduction in the Group workforce is the effect of the net
balance between new recruits and terminations in the year
(-1,094 people) and the change in scope (accounting overall
for +75 people), including decommissioning of the Mercure
plant, which is part of Enel Produzione in Italy, acquisition in
March of the Tradewind company in the US, sale of the Reft-
inskaya GRES plant in Russia and acquisition of PayTipper

Our people and their value

Since 2015, Enel has adopted a model of values and con-
ducts, the “Open Power” model, which takes form in var-
ious operational aspects, in order to increase the involve-
ment and participation of the people working at Enel, and
which serves as the point of reference for all people man-
agement and development processes. Specifically, there are
4 values (responsibility, trust, innovation and proactivity) and
