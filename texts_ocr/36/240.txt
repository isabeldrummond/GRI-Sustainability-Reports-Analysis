This process is aligned with the AA1000APS standard and
responds to the principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and
Responsiveness

Data collection, aggregation and processing of information are
managed using a dedicated IT system that is upgraded each
year to ensure increasing traceability, share best practices for
stakeholder engagement and monitoring and permit a degree
of coverage consistent with the company's organizational
model. The system allows specific views to be obtained, not
only at the level of the Group and individual companies, but
also by Business Line/Company Function and individual asset
(i.e., potential or actual operating site).

The Holding’s Sustainability Planning and Performance
Management unit plays a guidance and coordination role,
providing guidelines and methodological support for the
analysis conducted by the local personnel with the involvement
of the stakeholders and key people at the company level. The
results achieved at the level of the individual company and/
or country are then consolidated by the Holding Company
to prepare the Group's materiality matrix (see the section of
the “At a Glance” chapter entitled “Materiality analysis” for
detailed information on the results of the analysis)

 

The scope of the materiality analysis for 2019 has been
further expanded to include the new “Enel X” Business
Line, together with increasing integration of the results of the
application of CSV tools to the Group's assets. In particular,
in 2019 the analysis extended to 310 engagement initiatives,
including 18 countries, 51 companies and 22 assets

Identification of issues

and stakeholders

 

Regarding the 2019 materiality analysis process, the issues
and categories of stakeholders analysed were revised on the
basis of indications received from the Company's internal
and external stakeholders.

The issues subject to analysis were defined on the basis of
various aspects, including company policies and principles
of conduct, stakeholder feedback initiatives, the topics of
greatest interest to sustainability rating agencies, industry
benchmarking studies and the Company's strategic orien-
tation

The various units responsible for relations with stakehold-

Methodological note

ers, involved in the analysis process each year, are tasked
with identifying and updating the list of categories of rele-
vant stakeholders to draw up a complete list of current and
potential stakeholders and to ensure constant alignment
with the sustainability context in which Enel operates.

The methodology adopted involves an annual update to the
results achieved in the previous year and, every two years,
an analysis to determine a possible revision of the issues
and categories of stakeholders subject to analysis, to take
account of any changes in the context in which the Compa-
ny operates
