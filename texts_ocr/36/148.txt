Safety in contract processes

Safety is integrated in tender processes and the performance
of companies is monitored both on a preliminary level, by
means of the qualification system, and during contract exe-
cution through a large number of control processes and tools
such as the Supplier Performance Management tool (SPM).
A specific “HSE Terms” document has been prepared and
attached to all contracts since March 2019; the document
in question must be signed by contractors when the works
are awarded. The document, which is the same throughout
the entire Group, defines the obligations in relation to health,
safety and environmental aspects that the contractor must
respect, placing the same obligation on its subcontractors.
Any violation of the contractual conditions in question will
produce specific penalties up to termination of the contract
and/or suspension of qualification.

Significant impetus has also been given during the year to
“Safety Supplier Assessments’; which consist in the execution
of specific checks concerning safety issues, conducted in the
vendor's headquarters and on its job sites. The assessments
are carried out during the qualification phase for each new ven-
dor, or in cases in which criticalities emerge (severe or fatal inju-
ries) or low SMP rating scores. 746 assessments were carried

out in 2019 in the various countries and Business Lines.

One area of action, already started in 2018 but greatly de-

veloped in 2019, concerns the creation of a “Safety Partner

ship” with vendors having the following basic stages:

+> definition of a safety rating to measure companies’
management and operational performance. The perfor
mance parameters considered include the Contractors
Safety Index (CSI), an indicator based not only on detec-
tion of non-conformity in the field and ranking of the re-
lated severity, but also on the number and seriousness
of accidents. This indicator makes it possible to detect
faint signals and operational criticalities of contractors so
prevention can be selectively focused on the most crit-
ical companies in order to take increasingly responsive
actions to prevent accidents before they happen;

+> the adoption of targeted actions with personalised ac-
companiment plans for companies in order to reach the
required standards

In critical cases, Enel creates hybrid work teams with the com-

panies to carry out joint analysis of gaps to be filled, define tan-

gible actions to raise safety standards, and then track the imple-

mentation phase and effectiveness of the measures adopted.

Infrastructure safety
and technological innovation

Enel views technological innovation as a valid tool capable of
improving a large number of processes from the H&S per
spective. Several innovation projects on safety proceeded
and various new projects were launched in 2019 in order to
improve processes, starting from personnel training, con-
tinuing with the implementation of preventive and protec-
tive measures, up to the execution and analysis of corrective
checks.

Personal voltage detectors, i.e. portable devices designed
to identify electrical voltage on low- and medium-voltage
power lines located at operationally significant distances
from the worker but not necessarily involved in the activity

Occupational health and safety

in progress, have been adopted in the Infrastructure and Net-
works area. Promoted initiatives include an app that uses
uploaded confirmation photos to guarantee that all activities
calling for preparatory electrical disconnection of live parts
have been carried out in full compliance with the globally
adopted rules to ensure complete safety.

2019 also saw the experimentation of the sober-eye service,
which consists in monitoring the physical condition of work-
ers — in real time and by means of an app — by analysing the
pupil and its response to light stimuli (specifically, by record-
ing changes in the pupillary light reflex).
