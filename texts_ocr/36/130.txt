startups, providing access to all 20 of the Group's laboratories
specialising in the main areas of technological development,
including smart grids, renewables, and digitalization, with the
aim of promoting direct liaisons between Business Lines and
startups. Thanks to its capillary presence in innovation eco-
systems and the organisation of more than 25 bootcamps —
scouting initiatives dedicated to specific technologies of inter-
est to the Group, in 2019 Enel established contact with some
2,500 startups and launched more than 60 new collabora-
tions. Projects started in 2019 include collaboration with a
Catania-based startup engaged in building an automated plat-
form for the remote control of photovoltaic plants. In addition,
a network of partners has been created to help startups and
small and medium-sized enterprises working with the Group
to grow, gaining access to capital and industrialising their
solutions to streamline wide-sale dissemination.

In conformity with statutory legislation and Enel's compliance
programs, innovation activities are managed by the Innovabil-
ity (Innovation and Sustainability) Function in liaison with the
Holding Functions and Business Lines in all the Group's oper-
ating countries. Dedicated facilities on the Business Lines lev-
el have been set up to facilitate the development and dissem-
ination of innovative solutions. A three-year innovation plan
is drafted annually, in line with and supporting the Group's
strategic priorities. The plan is subject to approval of the
Group Innovation Committee, which is chaired by the Chief
Executive Officer, and shared with top management. The in-
novation priorities for the period 2020-2022 are connected
to the Group's strategic pillars and achievement of the Sus-
tainable Development Goals, and they concern: digitalization

of customer relations (apps for customers, chatbots on social
networks, virtual assistants), digital payments and digital ex-
tended payment plans (“Everywhere commerce"), “Voice of
customer” for continual improvement, circular economy and
bill discounts, inclusive offers for senior, disadvantaged, low
income, and vulnerable customers, alongside a paperless sys-
tem and innovative and inclusive digital services, responsible
consumption, and flexible offers thanks to the use of the new
Open Meters. The innovation process is monitored through
the use of specific indicators.

The “openinnovability.com" online crowdsourcing plat-
form is a digital meeting place where the dialogue is always
open and the ideas limitless. The five steps that make up
the crowdsourcing process consist in identifying a need,
issuing a challenge, sharing it with the outside world, as-
sessing proposals received and finally, rewarding the best,
also economically. The initiatives are inspired by the UN
Sustainable Development Goals and oriented towards fa-
cilitating access to energy by promoting new technologies
and seeking innovative and sustainable solutions to unre-
solved problems. The community created is composed of
some 400 thousand solvers and has allowed Enel to es-
tablish a global presence, with more than 100 countries
having actively participated in the challenges. In 2019, Enel
launched 25 innovation and sustainability challenges, of
which 10 cross-posted also on partner platforms, 4 dedi-
cated exclusively to people working within the Company
and 9 that offered the winners the opportunity of working
with the Group. A total of 73 challenges have been issued
since the platform was established. Among the challenges
launched in 2019, we draw your attention to “Mass cus-
tomization & inclusion", aimed at collecting innovative

 

ideas and proposals for customized products and services
in relation to diversity and inclusion issues, in which the
winning proposal was the “e-domorent” project for sus-
tainable use of home appliances. A challenge was also
launched to identify chemical free solutions for cooling
circuits treatment, with the aim of eliminating or reducing
the use of chemical products.
