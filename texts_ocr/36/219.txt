Intercompany transactions

For tax purposes, intercompany transactions are regulated in
accordance with the arm’s length principle — described in the
OECD's Model Tax Convention andTransfer Pricing Guidelines
—with the aim of aligning, as correctly as possible, transfer
pricing and conditions with the places of value creation
within the Group. In order to minimise tax risks, and in line
with the applicable regulations, the Enel Group encourages
the signing of rulings (Advance Pricing Agreements — APAs)
with the local tax authorities on establishing transfer pricing
determination methods, on attributing profits and losses to
permanent establishments and on applying rules on cross-
border flows between Group entities.

Low-tax jurisdictions

The Group does not invest in — or through — countries
considered to be tax havens for the sole purpose of reducing
its tax burden. Such investments may only be proposed if
they are supported by sound economic/strategic reasons
and have the aim of developing the activities included in the
Group's corporate purpose.

If, in circumstantial situations (for example, in the event of
third-party purchases of a group of companies), structures
were found to be have been created for the sole purpose of
reducing the tax burden or in areas deemed to be tax havens,
the Group — failing any sound economic/strategic reasons
other than mere tax savings — will commit to removing such
structures as quickly as possible.

Tax incentives

Tax incentives are a key, development-oriented mechanism
for economic policy, which countries use to stimulate growth
and attract investment to support the national policy. The
use of tax incentives generally results in a reduction of long-
term tax liabilities. Some countries where the Enel Group
operates offer various incentives. The Enel Group uses
widely applicable tax incentives for all operators, respecting
all specific regulations, where the incentives are in line with
its industrial and operational objectives and are consistent
with the economic substance of its investments.

Tax governance, control
and risk management

Governance body

In Enel’s organisational model, the Holding Company's Tax
Affairs unit is tasked — among other things — with developing
the Group's tax strategy, identifying, analysing and managing
the various optimisation initiatives, monitoring the key tax is-
sues and providing its support to the various Business Lines.
Alongside the Holding Function, the Tax Affairs units of the
various countries — acting in accordance with the values and
principles of the tax strategy set out by the holding company
—are responsible for managing compliance, tax planning and
tax monitoring at local level.

Organisation

The Enel Group has adopted a set of rules, procedures and
standards which are part of the Group's wider organisation
and control system and which are considered key points
of reference that all parties, depending on their type of
relationship with the Group, are required to observe". The
various policies and procedures applicable both at Group
level and country level regulate the activities, as well as their
management procedures and Tax Affairs responsibilities
including in relation to other corporate Functions. These
documents are published on the company Intranet and are
accessible to all Enel people; they form the general rules
of conduct applicable within the Group when carrying out
activities. Specifically in relation to taxation, in addition to the
tax strategy there are specific organisational documents —
both at global and local level — regarding the processes of Tax
Compliance, Tax Planning, Tax Monitoring, Transfer Pricing
and Tax Risk Management.

The general principle is that the Tax units must be the
appropriate size and equipped with the necessary skills to
perform the role of a decision-making analysis centre within
the governance and business processes, in addition to the
role of overseeing compliance performance. For this purpose,
specific and ongoing training initiatives on tax issues at both
