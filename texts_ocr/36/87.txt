ies, which holds regular meetings and participates in various
industry forums with a view to adopting increasingly appropri-
ate measures for the continuous improvement of customer

In Romania, the www.enel.ro website has introduced an
English version for non-Romanian customers. In 2019, a part-
nership was established with Pago, a bill payment app, with
an Enel customer loyalty offer.

In Chile, new digital platforms have been developed to pro-
vide the same information and the same level of customer
service, regardless of whether customers choose to be as-
sisted in person, remotely or digitally.

In Brazil, there is a wide range of customer communication
channels, with 80% of contacts made through digital chan-
nels. Using the website at www.enel.com.br, text messaging
and the app, customers can access information and services
while maintaining a transparent relationship with Enel. They
can also communicate with Enel through the main social me-
dia (Facebook, Twitter or Instagram), using specific applica-
tions for each social network, and an assistant can also be
contacted via chat (WhatsApp, Messenger, DM-Direct Mes-
sage or e-mail). Virtual assistant Elena, a WhatsApp chatbot,
is also available to interact with customers and show them
the easiest way to fulfil their requirements.

Enel complies with current customer privacy regulations in
all the countries where it operates. The Company also under-
takes to monitor all third-party companies that may be in a
position to use customers’ personal data. To this end, dedi-
cated clauses are included in contracts with partners who use
personal data to carry out specific activities, for example sales
services or customer satisfaction surveys. Customer data
are an expression of the individual's personality and identity,
therefore they must be treated with due caution and guaran-
tees. Enel considers personal data to be a shared asset and

a corporate asset at the same time. The Group has therefore
appointed a Data Protection Officer to guarantee full respect
for the privacy of all the individuals with whom it interacts. For
further details, see the “Sound governance” chapter.

ers in the solar self-consumption market in Spain. Thanks to
the experience gained and its technical knowledge, it sup-
ports customers in enhancing the technology needed to ac-
celerate the efficient consumption of energy, contributing to
achieve clean and renewable energy, savings of up to 50%
on annual electricity bills and a reduction in CO, emissions
into the atmosphere. The photovoltaic projects contracted
with Endesa X in 2019 will lead to a reduction in emissions
from customers of up to 13,500 t/year.

Furthermore, together with Amazon, the e-Home Business
