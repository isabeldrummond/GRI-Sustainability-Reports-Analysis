Environmental
Management Systems

One of the strategic objectives of the Group's Environmen-
tal policy is the application of the ISO 14001 certified Envi-
ronmental Policy Systems, across the whole organisation
structure. By the end of 2019, practically all the operational
businesses had activated and certified Environmental Man-
agement Systems (production plants, networks, services,
buildings, sales, etc.). Preparatory work has been commenced
for new plants and installations in view of their certification.

Given the complexity and the variety of its activities, the
Group decided to adopt management systems using a
modular approach. Thus, an ISO 14001:2015 certified man-
agement system was established at Holding level, providing
guidelines and coordinating the Business Lines in terms of
environmental issues. Each Business Line then launched its
own Environmental Management System focussed on its
own specific activities. The management systems adopted
comply with the new requirements introduced under the
most recent regulatory standards (14001:2015). In particular,
with respect to context analysis, the systems use the ana-
lytical data from the Sustainability Report (for further infor
mation, refer to the chapter on the “Definition of priorities”)

Enel Stop Work Policy

which take into account both internal and external contexts.
Enel is also registered with the EMAS Scheme (Eco-Man-
agement and Audit Scheme, https://corporate.enel.it/it/sto-
ries/a/2016/11/certifications-emas) for its main thermoelec-
tric and geothermal production sites in Europe. Moreover,
in complying with the four fundamental pillars that form the
basis of Enel’s environmental policy, specifically in terms of
our commitment towards “protecting the environment by
preventing adverse effects’ in 2018 the Group's “Stop Work
Policy” was defined, whereby all employees are temporarily
required to stop working when risks arise affecting not only
their own health and safety, but environmental safety too.
Training is one of the strategic objectives of the Group's pol-
icy and forms an integral part of the Environmental Manage-
ment System. In 2019, around 33,000 training hours were
given on the Environmental Management Systems, which
included, for example, water and waste management, envi-
ronmental remediation, and preventative works.

2019 saw the completion of an environmental training pro-
gramme aimed at upskilling technical personnel, whilst
increasing the environmental awareness of operations
management staff. Launched in 2018, across the Thermal
Generation in Italy, this programme was extended to oth-
er Business Lines and will be extended to other countries
throughout 2020.

 

At Enel we are constantly working to promote and consolidate a culture of health and safety for everyone involved in our
activities wherever they are in the world. We are raising awareness of risks and promoting responsible behaviour in order
to ensure that work is carried out to a high quality standard without accidents or injuries, because everyone who works
with us represents our most precious resource, deserving of our protection.

We are committed to protecting the environment, with the conviction that preventing risks and promoting responsible
behaviour is key to defending our wel-being and that of future generations.

We therefore ask each and every one of you to intervene quickly and stop any activity that might jeopardize your
health and safety or that of others or, similarly, that might cause harm to the environment. Specifically, these are acti-
vities that could be detrimental to the quality of environmental elements (air, soil, water, flora and fauna), or to a site's
archaeological and artistic heritage.

We also ask you to promptly report to your immediate superior or to a higher local Enel representative, any unsafe
behaviour and any action, omission, or situation that could potentially lead to a workplace injury or environmental damage.
The order to Stop Work must be applied without fear of consequences. No blame or responsibility will be attributed to
an employee or subcontractor who reports in good faith a situation of particular risk or who stops work, even if this action
should subsequently prove to have been unnecessary.

Our daily commitment is to the health and safety of workers and the protection of the environment, which take
priority over any other need.
