The importance of local actions

In Italy Enel manages Futur-e, a project for the requalifica-
tion of 23 power plants, with the goal of finding new solu-
tions and methods of use based on the criteria of social,
environmental and economic sustainability. This activity is
in close collaboration with local administrations, companies
and communities to develop energy reconversion and the
circular economy, while promoting innovation.

In 2019 the project was also extended to the thermoelectric
plants in Spain for which decommissioning by the end of
2020 has been announced. In particular, the project relat-
ed to the Compostilla power plant involves specific areas
of action that range from the active search for employment
for directly involved personnel to training for improving the
employability of plant personnel and the local community, as
well as the promotion of economic, employment and sus-
tainability activities in the area of reference.

Awareness and research

activities

The Just E-volution 2030 study carried out by The Eu-
ropean House - Ambrosetti in collaboration with Enel and
Fondazione Centro Studi Enel was presented in September
2019. The study used an innovative econometric model to
estimate the impact of the energy transition in progress,
supported by increasing electrification, digitalization and
generation from renewable sources, on industrial produc-
tion, employment, air quality in the European Union and in
more specifically in Italy, Spain and Romania.

Conference of the Parties (COP)

The Conference of the Parties (COP) of the United Na-
tions Framework Convention on Climate Change meets
once a year with all the countries that signed the Kyo-
to Protocol and the Paris Agreement, which are the two
main international treaties that reflect the global commit-
ment to combat climate change.

In particular, the agreement that was reached during the
2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in
Paris (COP21) marked a fundamental step towards cli-
mate action. The conference instituted a shared approach
on a global level to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions
that cause climate change. This is supported by sound
regulatory governance which however still lacks the rules
that would permit the redistribution amongst the individ-
ual countries of the additional reduction that is necessary
to reach the main objective of the agreement. The objec-
tive is to maintain the average increase in world tempera-
ture well below 2 °C as compared to pre-industrial levels,
aiming to limit it to 1.5 °C. COP25 was held in Spain in
2019 with the objective of promoting further progress in
the key points of the Paris Agreement, in particular arti-
cle 6 regarding international carbon markets. COP25 also
concentrated on pushing countries to reinforce their am-
bitions in view of the presentation in 2020 of new and
updated national action plans for climate change (NDC
- Nationally Determined Contribution). Enel and its Span-
ish subsidiary Endesa have played a proactive role as a
conference sponsor. They convened and participated in
various side events and governmental meetings that were
held during the conference.

“European Green Deal”

On December 11, 2019, the European Commission pre-

sented the “European Green Deal” (EGD), a growth strat-

egy that aims to improve the well-being of persons. The

European Union intends to achieve net zero emission by

2050, protect human, animal and plant life by reducing

pollution, help companies become world leaders in clean

products and technology, contribute towards a just and in-

clusive transition. On March 4, 2020 the Commission pre-

sented the first European legislative proposal regarding

climate to transform this political commitment into a legal

obligation and stimulate investments. To achieve these

objectives, all of the following sectors must act:

+> energy: decarbonize the energy sector;

+> construction: restructure buildings, help people re-
duce their energy bills and energy use;

+ industry: support the industry to innovate and become
world green economy leaders;

> mobility: introduce cleaner, more economic and
healthier private and public means of transport.

An assessment of measures to define a more ambitious

greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2030 is en-
