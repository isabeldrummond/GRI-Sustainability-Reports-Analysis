The 2017 and 2018 figures have been recalculated in line with the reclassification of the turbogas plants in Italy (2,223 MW restated from CCGT

to Oil & Gas).

In some thermal plants, multiple technology units are present.
Additional renewable capacity, excluding disposals and changes in scope, mainly in North, Central and Latin America.
In 2018, the distribution company Eletropaulo was acquired in Brazil
The distributed energy figure for 2018 takes into account a more precise determination of the quantities transported.
The 2018 data were adjusted to reflect the IFRS Committee (IFRIC) interpretations given in the March 2019 Agenda Decision, which resulted in a
different classification — without affecting the margins recorded — of the effects related to contracts of purchase and sale of commodities measured
at fair value in profit and loss (refer to the information given in note 4.3 of the Enel Group 2019 Financial Report).
