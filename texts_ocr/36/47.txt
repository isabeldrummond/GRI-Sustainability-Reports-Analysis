 

Electricity is essential to guarantee the sustainable progress
of modern societies and represents a key factor in reaching
the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, in particular
SDG 7, to guarantee everyone accessible, reliable, sustaina-
ble and modern energy, and SDG 13, regarding climate action.
The electricity production has always played a key role in
climate change, as the use of fossil fuels is a considerable
source of greenhouse gas emissions. Technological devel-
opment, in particular in the area of renewable energies, has
however completely transformed this scenario by making
electricity one of the main solutions for reducing the carbon
footprint world-wide. Enel is aware of these impacts and im-
plements specific actions to minimise them, promoting the
decarbonization of the energy system and the electrification
of the energy demand. As a result, this reduces the green-
house gas emissions along the entire value chain.

Enel's electricity production from fossil fuels (mainly coal and
gas) has traditionally represented the main source of green-
house gas emissions. In particular, in 2019 the direct emissions
(Scope 1) related to generation from fossil fuels were around
69.4 mil t CO,, whereas indirect emissions (Scope 3) related
to the extraction and transport of fuels were equal to 4.0 mil t,,
of CO, (considering also those relating to the transport of raw
materials and waste). Enel is minimising this impact by accel-
erating the decommissioning of coal plants, with a reduction
of capacity in 2019 equal to 4.1 GW. In parallel, the Group is in-
creasing the development of renewable capacity that, together
with the contribution of nuclear generation, has avoided 77 mil
tof CO, emissions. Furthermore, Enel is actively committed to
the development of energy storage systems that support the
integration of renewable capacity, with a total installed capac-
ity of 110 MW in 2019. The decarbonization of the energy mix

also has a positive impact on the reduction of indirect green-
house gas emissions (Scope 2) associated with the acquisition
of electricity to cover the requirements of business activities.
The management of the electricity network involves the
generation of indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2)
associated with energy losses on the grid, equal to 3.8 mil t,,
of CO, in 2019. Enel is actively investing in the digitalization
and automation of the electricity grid to reduce these losses
and increase reliability, while promoting the diffusion of re-
newables in the energy system.

Even if Enel does not have a direct impact in terms of green-
house gas emissions in the retail market, the use of products
sold by its own customers generates greenhouse gas emis-
sions that are accounted for as indirect emissions (Scope 3).
In particular, the emissions connected to the use of electricity
sold to customers equalled around 29.0 mil t,, of CO, where-
as those related to gas sold equalled 23.9 mil t,, of CO,. Enel
regularly monitors these emissions and adopts measures
aimed at minimising them. In particular, Enel is committed
to reducing its indirect emissions associated with the sale of
natural gas on the retail market 16% by 2030, with respect to
the 2017 values. This goal has been certified by the Science
Based Targets initiative.

Finally, Enel offers its customers sustainable energy solutions
to reduce the carbon footprint of their energy consumption
in a wide range of sectors, including transport, buildings as
well as industrial processes and services. For example, with
Enel X the Group is promoting the deployment of charging
infrastructures for electrical vehicles (79,565 charging points
installed in 2019), the development of energy efficiency solu-
tions, distributed generation, consultancy services, smart
public lighting and circular cities.
