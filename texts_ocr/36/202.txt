Remuneration policy

 

Enel’s 2019 remuneration policy, adopted by the Board
of Directors on the proposal of the Nomination and
Compensation Committee was widely welcomed by the
shareholders at the Shareholders’ Meeting of May 16, 2019.
It has been drawn up taking account of the best national and
international practices and the indications arising from the
favourable vote of the Shareholders’ Meeting of May 24,
2018 on the 2018 remuneration policy. The policy also takes
into account the results of the Company's engagement on
corporate governance issues between December 2018 and
February 2019 with the main proxy advisors and institutional
investors present in Enel’s share capital. In line with the
recommendations contained in the Corporate Governance
Code for listed companies, Enel's remuneration policy for
2019 is aimed at attracting, motivating and retaining the
resources with the most suitable professional qualities to
successfully manage the Company. Moreover, the policy aims
to encourage the achievement of the Company's strategic
targets and sustainable growth, as well as align the interests
of management with the priority target of creating sustainable
value for shareholders in the medium to long term. It also
serves to promote the Company's mission and values.
