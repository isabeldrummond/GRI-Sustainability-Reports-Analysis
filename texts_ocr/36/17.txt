The analysis of priorities (“materiality
analysis”) makes it possible to identify
and assess material issues for stakehold-
ers, weighted on the basis of their rele-
vance, correlating them with the Group's
priorities and with the business strate-
gy, considering impacts generated and
suffered, in order to check their “align-
ment” (or “misalignment") and identify
areas of possible improvement.

The result of this analysis is shown in
the priorities matrix (or materiality ma-
trix) and it supports the identification and
definition of issues for preparation of the
Sustainability Report and the objectives
to include in the Strategic Plan and in the
Sustainability Plan, the accomplishment
of which is guaranteed by contributions
from the various Group Functions and
Business Lines. The materiality analysis
is brought to the attention of the Corpo-
rate Governance and Sustainability Com-
mittee at the time of the Sustainability
Plan guidelines review. Moreover, the
Corporate Governance and Sustainabili-
ty Committee and the Control and Risks
Committee issue preventive opinions
concerning the Sustainability Report,
which includes the materiality analysis,
and submit them to the Board of Direc-
tors in its meeting convened to approve
the Report.

The process allows to identify not only
the priorities for the entire Group, but
also for single countries, down to the
level of detail of Business Line/Business
Function and individual assets (meaning
potential or actual operating sites).

The methodology employed was devel-
oped taking into account the guidelines
of several international standards, includ-
ing the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI),
SASB (Sustainability Accounting Stand-
ards Board), standard AA1O00APS and
the SDG Compass, which supports com-
panies in adapting their strategies to com-
ply with the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). Specifically, the issues sub-
ject to analysis cover all 17 SDGs.
The issues, classified in categories of
business and governance issues, social
issues and environmental issues, were
assessed in 2019 based on the priorities
assigned by stakeholders (horizontal axis
of the matrix) and by the Company (verti-
cal axis of the matrix). The overall Group
matrix considers the contributions of the
main companies involved in the process,
based on their relevance with respect to
the type of business in which they op-
erate. Below, some of the main material
issues are shown, highlighting their relat-
ed motivations and main impacts.
> Occupational health and safety —
Enel considers people's health, safe-
ty and psychological and physical
well-being one of the main priorities
of the Group. Optimal management
of this issue contributes to generate
trust and boost the commitment of
people in relation to the Group and
the work they perform, also helping
to improve performance, raise pro-
ductivity and reduce labour cost. In
confirmation of the constant com-
mitment assumed by Enel in relation
to safety, the total combined injury
Frequency Rate (FR) in 2019 for Enel
people and contractors was down
by 18% compared to 2018.

italization and the spread of new
technologies are accelerating the
transformation of a large number
of sectors. This context offers new
opportunities based on the devel-
opment of energy solutions that
promote sustainability and make it
possible to diversity the offering of
the products and services the Group
proposes to its customers, both in-
fluencing the traditional business
and promoting the creation of new
models. Innovation of products,
services or processes is a strategic
priority that guarantees the Compa-
ny's long-term success against the
background of an increasingly com-
petitive and demanding market. In
this context, the Group has includ-
ed clear and precise objectives in
its 2020-2022 Sustainability Plan,
aimed at defining and developing
new products and services, promot-
ing the application of new technol-
ogies in the sphere of energy effi-
ciency, electric mobility, storage and
other sustainable energy solutions.
Sound governance and fair cor-
porate conduct - Ene! has estab-
lished a system of rules, models and
control mechanisms inspired by the
highest standards of transparency
and fairness in management of the
business, both internally and exter-
nally. This model generates trust
among stakeholders, an aspect that
is reflected also in the economic re-
sults and in positioning in the prin-
cipal ESG ratings and sustainability
indices.
