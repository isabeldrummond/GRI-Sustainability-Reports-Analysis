2019 marked the beginning of a new form of digitalized com-
plaint management providing an end-to-end view of the pro-
cess, made even more efficient by a shorter management
schedule, resulting in a more positive customer perception.
In Romania, customers can send reports using different
channels: dedicated e-mail address for complaints and re-
quests, website, direct call centre helpline or visiting a Punto
Enel.

In Colombia, a digital transformation of the process has
started and an automated procedure (RPA - Robot Process
Automation) adopted for the management of complaints
about energy consumption, in order to speed up the process
of responding to customers.

In Brazil, a customer experience team analyses the causes
of complaints using analytical tools (for example, geograph-
ical analysis of complaints), surveys and forums with cus-
tomers themselves, to develop improvement actions.

Care of vulnerable
customers

 

Enel is attentive to people’s needs, improving and main-
taining access to electricity in the most disadvantaged
areas and the poorest people. All the countries in which
the Group operates in fact provide forms of support, often
linked to state initiatives, which make it easier for certain
sections of the population to pay electricity and gas bills,
thus allowing equal access to energy.

In Italy, since 2008 for the electricity sector and 2009 for
the gas sector, a discount has been provided for domes-
tic customers experiencing financial hardship and — for the
electricity sector only — for customers who use life-saving
electro-medical equipment (known as the “social bonus”).
The bonus is funded with state resources and specific tar-
iff components determined by the Authority. Applications
for the bonus are handled by the local town council and
— if approved — customers are awarded a credit on their
bill that varies according to their income and number of
people in the family. In 2019, the social bonus was award-
ed to approximately 512,000 customers of Enel Energia
and approximately 450,000 customers of Servizio Elet-
trico Nazionale. In general, protection is provided in case
of disconnection of the electricity supply: in the event of
non-payment, customers who have an electronic meter are
not cut off completely but their available power is reduced
and only cut off completely only if the default persists.

In Iberia, the social bonus regulation, which came into
force in 2018, with discounts of 25%, 40% or even 100%
depending on the level of vulnerability of the customer, was
consolidated. At the end of 2019, Endesa paid the bonus to
435,484 customers: 228,821 vulnerable and 206,663 seri-
ously vulnerable customers.

Furthermore, several agreements have been signed since
2015 with local/regional authorities and service sector or-
ganisations to avoid cuts in supplies to customers recog-
nised as “vulnerable” by social services. Currently there
are 272 agreements in force, including 6 with autonomous
regions and 5 with federations of municipalities. In 2019,
36,723 households benefited from these agreements,
which are estimated to correspond to over 110,000 people.
In addition, since 2018 Endesa has offered its customers
in vulnerable groups the opportunity to pay their bills in in-
