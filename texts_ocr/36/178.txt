Efficient energy use for Enel means, on the one hand, max-
imising the yields from mixed sources (thermal, nuclear and
renewables), and, on the other hand, constantly improving
network efficiencies. Enel's strategy for energy consump-
tion reductions thus involves investments to increase the
efficiency in all the Group's activities, from production to dis-
tribution, whilst focussing on increasing greater behavioural
awareness (for further information, refer to chapter “Com-
mitment to the fight against climate change”). In 2019,
improvement of process efficiency and implementation of
operational excellence programmes continued in the vari-
ous Business Lines. Energy consumption mainly includes
fossil fuels for the operation of thermal power plants and
uranium for nuclear power plants. A limited share of energy
consumption is related to operation of the plants generating
electricity from renewable sources.

Total direct consumption of fuel was 1,257972 TJ (30.1
Mtoe). Fuel energy consumption over the year recorded a
fall of 19% on 2018, due to lower thermal generation, spe-
cifically coal-fuelled production. Geothermal energy produc-
tion in Italy and Chile has remained substantially stable. The
Group's energy intensity, which provides a measure of its
operational efficiency, in 2019 was 5.4 MJ/kWh,,, down 10%
on the previous year. This decrease reflects the change in the
production mix in the year which is showing, with a decrease
in thermal generation, an increase in production activity from
renewable energies.

As per the previous year, during 2019 various interventions
