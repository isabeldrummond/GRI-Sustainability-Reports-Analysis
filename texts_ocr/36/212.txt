> the board review, coordinated by the Chair, which
is recommended to be performed annually with the
support — at least every three years — of an independent
and specialized advisor;

+ the directors’ induction, coordinated by the Chair, serves
to provide them with adequate knowledge of — among
other things — the sector where the company operates,
the company's business, the organisational structures,
as wellas changes tothe legal and regulatory framework;

> the management of inside information, with a
recommendation to adopt both corporate procedures to
prevent misuse of said information, as well as a register
of individuals who have access to the data itself;

> compliance with the reference markets’ corporate
governance codes and best practices, except in cases
where — in the opinion of the management body, there
are objective reasons justifying non-compliance or
partial compliance.

The Recommendations in question are available on the Enel
website and have been implemented by the relevant bodies
of the target companies in the course of 2016.
Subsequently, in 2017, a project was launched involving
Corporate Affairs managers from the Group's major listed
companies, supported by renowned academic experts in the
area of corporate governance. This project helped identify,
at the end of an in-depth comparative analysis, shared
solutions for the approval of intercompany transactions,
applicable across the Enel Group, within the limitations of
the regulations of the various countries where the Group
operates.

This has given rise to the dedicated Corporate Governance

Guidelines, which preliminarily identify the principles

underpinning the Group's corporate governance and

impose precise common principles to be applied in relation
to conflicts of interests of directors and transactions with
related parties.

It should be noted that these Guidelines go over and above

the controversial notion of “group interest’ the existence of

which is brought into question in various systems, while at the
same time providing a clear definition of corporate interest as

a useful benchmark for the management of both directors’

conflicts of interest and transactions with related parties.

Having been approved by Enel's Board of Directors in 2017

the Guidelines were adopted in 2018 by the competent

governing bodies of the listed subsidiaries. Moreover, they
have been presented during an international seminar on
multinational groups held in Madrid in October 2018, attended

Sound governance

by the representatives of the supervisory authorities of the
financial markets where the most relevant subsidiaries are
listed and by leading academics. The Guidelines are also
available on the Enel website.
Completing the Group's corporate governance system:
> the Group's Code of Ethics, approved by Enel’s Board
of Directors in 2002 and subsequently updated, which
sets out the reference values which guide the Group in
carrying out various activities, regulating and harmonizing
corporate behaviour in accordance with standards
based on maximum transparency and integrity towards
all stakeholders;
> the “Enel Global Compliance Program” approved in 2016
and that aims to step up the Enel Group's commitment
to preventing offences from being committed abroad
that might generate corporate criminal liability and the
related reputational risks;
> the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan - ZTC, adopted
in 2006 to give substance to Enel's adherence to the
UN Global Compact and to the Partnership Against
Corruption Initiative (PACI);
> the Human Rights Policy adopted in 2013 and activities
for achieving and/or maintaining the ISO 37001:2016
certification ("Anti-Bribery Management System”) by
the main Group companies.
Lastly, between the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020, Enel
made a further in-depth analysis of the corporate governance
of the Group's listed companies with higher capitalisation
and/or free float, with the support of a qualified advisor that
operates internationally.
This analysis was carried out in light of the Enel Group's
corporate governance reference model’, as well as the
recommendations of local corporate governance codes
and market practices of the countries where the various
companies in question operate. The analysis made it
possible to identify and add value to several best practices
specific to each of the companies concerned. At the same
time, it also drew a path towards achieving an evergreater
convergence of these companies towards the Enel Group's
corporate governance reference model. The overall structure
of the project in question is described in the graphs shown in
the following page, indicating the companies involved.

5 Thismodelis based on the parent company’s corporate governance system,
on the corporate governance recommendations of the Enel Group’s listed
companies, as well as on several international best practices relating to the
composition and functioning of the Board of Directors.
