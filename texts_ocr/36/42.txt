 

visioned: 50-55% less than the current target of 40%. To
this end, the European Commission will launch a review
of all relevant climate-related policy instruments in order
to align them with the new climate targets: in primis the
Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the possibility of
extending it to new sectors, the Energy Taxation Direc-
tive and the introduction of a “carbon border adjustment
mechanism” for specific sectors aimed at reducing the
risk of “carbon leakage” and preserving the competitive-
ness of EU industry.

A proposal has been advanced for a new sustainable
investment plan that includes a “just transition mecha-
nism” and a “just transition fund” aimed at helping vul-
nerable regions and sectors that are heavily dependent on
fossil fuels and mobilising the funds necessary to achieve
the objectives of the European Green Deal.

“Clean Energy for all Europeans”

legislative package

The “Clean Energy for all Europeans” legislative package,
proposed by the European Commission in 2016, laid the
foundation necessary for achieving greater integration
and regionalisation of markets for electricity, balancing,
flexibility services and capacity. Following the inter-insti-
tutional agreement reached in 2018, the following regu-
lations and directives completing the package were pub-
lished in the Official Journal of the European Union on 14
June 2019: the Electricity Market Regulation (2019/943),
the ACER Regulation (2019/942), the Risk Preparedness
Regulation (2019/941) and the Electricity Market Directive
(2019/944). The measures entered force on July 4, 2019,
with the regulations taking immediate effect, while the
directive must be transposed into the law of the various

EU countries by December 31, 2020.

The new legislation fosters the integration of the differ-
ent technologies and the participation of diverse market
operators. It also opens up the possible development of
mechanisms to provide long-term signals to investment in
decarbonization (e.g. auctions, PPAs) and the adequacy of
the electricity system (the capacity market)

Enel’s positioning

The European Union's decision-making and regulatory pro-
cesses affect the on-going energy transition, effecting
company business models, the behaviours of consumers
and individual citizens, with a direct impact on legislative
framework implemented on a national level in the countries
in which the Group operates. Furthermore, regarding its
transnational nature and the current global challenges, the
European legislative process is becoming increasingly com-
plex and, for that purpose, closer collaboration is required
between EU institutions and the other stakeholders.

In this context, Enel decided a few years ago to establish
the Europe and Euro-Mediterranean Affairs Function, which
monitors relevant topics and represents the Group on a Eu-
ropean level in relation to institutions, organisations, asso-
ciations and other active parties. A specific unit is dedicat-
ed to consolidating and representing the Group's position
on policies regarding climate change, low-carbon emission
strategies, international carbon market regulation, the envi-
ronment and the safety of procurements. Enel will therefore
use this unit to support climate protection and follow the
involvement of institutional stakeholders, professional asso-
ciations, non-governmental organisations and the academic
world. This activity of involving the stakeholders contributes
towards the evolution of the European regulatory framework
