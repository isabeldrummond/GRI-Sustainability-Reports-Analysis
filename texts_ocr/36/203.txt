of the EUROSTOXX Utilities - EMU index in the three-
year period 2019-2021; ROACE (Return on Average
Capital Employed) cumulative for the three-year period
2019-2021; CO, emissions from the Enel Group's power
plants in 2021.
The 2019 LT| Plan also provides that any premium accrued
is represented by a share component, to which a monetary
component can be added based on the level of achievement
of the various targets. In particular, it is envisaged that
100% of the basic premium of the Chief Executive Officer
and General Manager and 50% of the basic premium of
the DRSs will be paid in Enel shares, previously acquired
by the Company. The disbursement of a significant portion
of the long-term variable remuneration (equal to 70% of

the total) is deferred to the second financial year after the
relevant three-year period referred to in the 2019 LTI Plan (i.e.
deferred payment).

The 2019 LT! Plan sets a target for CO, emissions (grams per
kWh equivalent produced by the Group in 2021) and, as part
of the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager's short-
term variable remuneration plan, a target linked to safety in
the workplace with the aim of promoting the application of a
sustainable business model.

A detailed description of the remuneration policy for 2019
and compensations paid in 2018 is provided in the 2019
Remuneration Report available on the Company website

The Internal Control and Risk Management System
("SCIGR") consists of the set of rules, procedures, and
organisational entities aimed at allowing the main corporate
risks within the Group to be identified, measured, managed
and monitored.
The SCIGR is integrated into the more general organisational
and corporate governance structures adoptedby the Company
and by the Group and is based on national and international
best practices. In particular, the system takes into account
the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code
and is consistent with the “Internal Controls — Integrated
Framework" model issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organisations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO
Report”) — the internationally recognised benchmark for
the analysis and integrated assessment of the SCIGR's
effectiveness.
Specifically, the SCIGR:
+> sets out control actions at every operating level and
clearly identifies duties and responsibilities, so as to
avoid duplications of tasks and ensure coordination
among the main persons involved in the SCIGR itself;

202

 

+> ensures the necessary separation of operating and
control activities, so as to prevent or — where that is not
possible — mitigate conflicts of interest;

+> guarantees the traceability of the tasks of identifying,
assessing, managing, and monitoring risks, ensuring
the reconstruction of the sources over time and the
information that supports these tasks.

The SCIGR is divided into three distinct types of activities:

> “line” or “first level" controls, consisting of all control
tasks that the individual operating units or Group
companies perform on their processes in order to
ensure that operations are carried out properly;

> “second level” controls, which are entrusted to specific
corporate Functions and aimed at managing and
monitoring typical risk categories;

> internal audit activity ("third level” controls) aimed at
checking the structure and overall functionality of the
SCIGR, including by monitoring the “line” and “second
level” controls.

The SCIGR is subject to periodical tests and checks, taking

into account the evolution of corporate operations and the
