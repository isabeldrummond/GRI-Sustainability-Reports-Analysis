The reporting process

On the basis of the results of the materiality analysis, it was
possible to define the structure of the 2019 Sustainability Re-
port by focusing more on the material topics, to which spe-
cific detailed chapters have been devoted. Similarly, the level
of materiality of issues, which in turn have been divided into
detailed sub-issues, influenced the depth in which to discuss
the individual subjects and to report on the relevant GRI indi-
cators (GRI Standards and Electric Utilities Sector Disclosure)
in order to qualify as “in accordance” Core option, as well as
the choice of the tools best suited to representing them (2019
Annual Report and appended reports), to which reference
has been made for the discussion or further examination of
more specific topics relating to economic or governance per-

formance. The materiality analysis also formed the basis for
defining Enel’s sustainability goals for the 2020-2022 period,
as illustrated in the Sustainability Plan (see the “Ata Glance”
chapter, “The 2020-2022 Sustainability Plan”).

The process of reporting and monitoring the Key Performance
Indicators ("KPIs") relevant to sustainability involves the Holding,
with regard to transversal issues, and all Group Business Lines,
Functions and companies for issues and indicators specific to
the various sectors of activity.

Those responsible for collecting, verifying and processing the rel-
evant KPIs are identified within the units involved. The Sustain-
ability Planning and Performance Management unit, which is a
part of the Innovability Function, is responsible for consolidating
information and coordinating the entire process of preparing the
2019 Sustainability Report.

The Report was analysed and assessed by Enel’s Control and
Risks Committee and Corporate Governance and Sustainabili-
ty Committee on April 1, 2020 and approved by the Board of
Directors on April 2. The document will then be presented to
the General Shareholders’ Meeting together with the Group's
Annual Report.

This Report was subject to a limited audit by an independent
company, EY SpA, as the auditor also engaged to audit the Enel
Group's Annual Report. The limited audit was conducted in ac-

Methodological note

cordance with the international standard ISAE 3000 (Revised)?
and, accordingly, the Code of Ethics for Professional Account-
ants, including professional independence and verification of the
absence of conflicts of interest that may affect the ethical prin-
ciples of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and dili-
gence, confidentiality and professional conduct. The audit report,
which contains a detailed description of the principles adopted,
activities performed and conclusions reached, is appended.

In addition, a report on the green bond, also subject to an audit
by EY SpA according to the criteria indicated in the standard ISAE
3000, has been appended to this Report, together with the rele-
vant audit report.

The GHG Inventory Statements were audited by DNV GL, with
a reasonable level of certainty for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3
emissions, as limited to the sale of natural gas, and with a limited
level of certainty for the other Scope 3 emissions included within
the scope of application of the inventory. The audit was conduct-
ed according to the standard ISO 4064-3 for the compliance of
greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories with the WBCSDMWRI Cor-
porate Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol).
