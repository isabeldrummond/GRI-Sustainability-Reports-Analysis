economy and handle relations with institu-
tions, other companies (in all sectors) and
stakeholders. Synergy between the three
areas guarantees Enel’s effort to identify
innovative solutions.
Moreover, considering it to be essential to
evaluate the success and effectiveness of
the circular economy, Enel has developed
a circularity measurement model (“Cir-
culAbility Model”) that takes account of
all five pillars, expressed through specific
sub-indicators, namely flow circularity, which
considers all components of materials and
energy in the input and output phases, and
circularity of use, which measures the ma-
terials utilisation factor, both through the ex-
‘tension of life expectancy and taking account
of the application of sharing and “product
asa-service” principles. After identifying the
metric, the following Business Line-specific
approaches were outlined:
> Procurement: the supply categories
were subjected to a systematic analysis
of the entire life cycle ("Life Cycle As-
sessment"), to track environmental im-
pacts and all material and energy flows
during the supply generation process;
> Circular Assets: in order to manage
Group assets with a circular approach,
circularity of the design, construction,
operation and end of life phases is
measured, making it possible to identi-
fy operating initiatives that make it pos-
sible to increase the overall process
circularity rating;

> Enel X: measurement of the level of
circularity of the products and services
offered to customers (in order to pro-
vide a tool of comparison for interest-
ed end consumers sensitive to envi-
ronmental issues) and of the circularity
of industrial customers and the public
administration.

The circular economy projects that Enel

has launched are numerous and can be ar-

ranged in the following main areas:

> Global Procurement: the project
is designed to steer the entire sup-
ply chain towards circularity through
measurement of the circularity of the
products and services purchased by
‘the Group, introduction of K factors to
award vendors by means of specific
tender instruments for their use in the
transition towards a circular economy,
and the start of coinnovation projects
to review the supply chain from a cir-
cular perspective;

> Assets (GPG, G I&N): aimed at inte-
grating the benefits of electrification
in environmental, social and eco-
nomic terms, in order to rethink the
value chain from a circular perspec-
tive in terms of material and energy
flows. The circular approach is applied
throughout all stages of the life of as-
sets, from design to construction, op-
eration and up to the end of life;

> Customers (Enel X): aimed at acceler-
ating circularity, within the Company's

ecosystem of vendors, partners and
customers. A process of measure-
ment and improvement of circularity
of the solutions in the Group's port-
folio has been started with innovative
projects through the Circular Economy
Boosting Program;

Circular Cities®: for more than two
years, a work group that includes
the Business Lines, Countries, and
various staff areas is exploring chal-
lenges and solutions for the cities of
tomorrow in the context of the circu-
lar economy, to be expressed both in
Group activities and in collaboration
with stakeholders (institutions, other
industrial sectors, etc.);

Country: the Group pursues numer
ous initiatives in the Countries, both
with the government and with region-
al and local administrations, in addition
to the inception of extended collabo-
rations on the topic to strengthen the
role of the business, and ongoing col-
laboration with research centres and
associations to disseminate aware-
ness of the topic. The main Country
activities were started in Italy and then
extended to Spain, Chile, Colombia,
Argentina, Brazil, Peru and the US.

Enel’s positioning in respect of circular cities is
shown in the document “Circular cities. Cities of
tomorrow", which is available at the following link

be essential to open up to dialogue with parties that share our vision, involving the chains and promoting common initiatives

to safeguard natural resources and boost competitiveness of the country. In 2017 Enel launched the Alliance for the Circular
Economy and signed a Declaration of Intent with companies in the Made in Italy sector, occupying leading positions in a range
of manufacturing sectors. The goal of the Alliance is to guide a global evolution of the manufacturing scenario from a circular per-

spective that promotes the unique features of Made in Italy products, focusing on innovation, aiding the sharing of experiences

and best practices and stimulating constant dialogue with the entire ecosystem. In 2019, an increasing level of interest for the

initiative allowed the Alliance to achieve ever greater participation in terms of the number of companies involved and sectors

represented, in such a way as to increase the level of support for the development of circular business models.
