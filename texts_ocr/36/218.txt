Tax transparency

Enel is an industrial group whose main activity involves
electricity generation, distribution and sales. The choice of
countries where the Group operates is guided by business
choices and not by tax reasons.

Tax strategy

Since 2017, the Enel Group has adopted a tax strategy,
as a set of principles and guidelines inspired by values
of transparency and legality, which is published on the
website: www.enel.com. The Group's subsidiaries are
required to adopt the tax strategy approved by the parent
company, thereby assuming the responsibility of ensuring it
is acknowledged and applied.

Tax strategy objectives

Enel SpAs Board of Directors sets out the tax strategy

of the entire Group, with the aim of ensuring uniform

tax management for all entities involved. The strategy is

underpinned by the following approach:

+> correct and timely determination and settlement of
taxes due under the law and implementation of the
respective obligations;

> correct management of the tax risk, which is the risk
incurred for the violation of tax rules or abuse of the
principles and purposes of the tax system.

Tax strategy principles

The tax strategy principles are the guidelines for Group
companies, underpinning _ their operations
when managing the fiscal variable. The principles also
require suitable processes to be adopted to ensure their
effectiveness and application.

Values: in line with its sustainability strategy, the Group acts
in accordance with the values of honesty and integrity in
its tax management, being aware that tax revenue is one
of the main sources of contribution to economic and social
development of the countries in where it operates.
Legality: the Group pursues behaviour geared towards
compliance with the applicable tax rules and is committed to

business

Sound governance

interpreting them in a way that respects both the substance
and form.

Tone at the top: the Board of Directors has the role and
responsibility of leading the dissemination of a corporate
culture based on the values of honesty and integrity and
the principle of legality.

Transparency: the Group maintains collaborative and
transparent relations with tax authorities, enabling them —
among other things — to gain a full understanding of the facts
underlying the application of tax rules.

Shareholder value: The Group considers taxes as a business
cost and, as such, believes that it must be managed in
compliance with the principle of legality, with the aim of
safeguarding the Group's assets and pursuing the primary
interest of creating value for shareholders in the medium to
long term.

Governance

Enel SpA ensures that the tax strategy is acknowledged and
applied within the company through the governance bodies.
Its interpretation is left to the parent company, through the
Tax unit, which also manages its periodic updates.

Compliance

The Group entities must respect the principle of legality,
applying the tax laws of the countries where the Group
operates, to ensure that the wording, spirit and purpose of
the applicable tax rule or system is respected. Moreover,
the Enel Group does not undertake behaviours or domestic
or cross-border operations that result in purely artificial
constructions, that do not reflect the economic reality and
from which it is reasonable to expect undue tax advantages,
where they conflict with the purpose or spirit of tax provisions
or system in question and give rise to double deduction,
deduction/non-inclusion or double non-taxation, including
as a result of any divergence between the tax systems of
different jurisdictions.
