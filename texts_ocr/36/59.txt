Identification, assessment
and management

of physical risks

and opportunities

Taking the IPCC scenarios as our reference point, develop-
ments in the following physical variables and the associated
operational and industrial impacts connected with potential
risks and opportunities are assessed.

Chronic physical risks

The climate scenarios developed with the ICTP do not

provide definitive indications of structural changes before

2030, but changes could begin to emerge between 2030

and 2050.

The main impacts of chronic physical changes would be

reflected in the following variables:

> Electricity demand: variation in the average tempera-
ture level with a potential increase or reduction in elec-
tricity demand.

> Thermal generation: variation in the level and average
temperatures of the oceans and rivers, with effects on
thermal generation.

> Hydroelectric generation: variation in the average
level of rainfall and snowfall and temperatures with a
potential increase or reduction in hydro generation;

IMPACT DESCRIPTION

 

 

Risk/opportunity:
increase or decrease in
electricity demand,

Chronic physical Market

Electricity demand is also affected by temperature, whose
fluctuations can have an impact on Enel’s business.
Although structural changes should not emerge in the
short/mediurterm, in order to assess the sensitivity of
Group performance to potential temperature variations,
Enel has performed an analysis of sensitivity to changes
of +/-1% in electricity demand for the Group as a whole.

Short term

 

Risk/opportunity:
increase or decrease in
renewables generation

Chronic physical Market

Renewables generation is also affected by the
availability of resources, whose fluctuations can have
an impact on our business. Although structural changes
should not emerge in the shor/medium-term, in order
to assess the sensitivity of Group performance to
potential temperature variations, we have performed an
analysis of sensitivity to changes of +/-10% in potential
electricity output by technology

Short term

 

1 Time horizon: short (2020-2022); medium (up to 2030); long (2030-2050).
