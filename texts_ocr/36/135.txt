Machine learning

Machine learning — Digitalization and development of innovative tools based on machine learning technologies will
make it possible to carry out predictive analysis for maintenance of electricity distribution and generation plant com-
ponents, identifying faults early and taking action before the occurrence of breakdowns of major components, which
would reduce the availability of the plants concerned. Reducing the risk of malfunctions has a significant impact not only
in economic terms, but also in relation to the environment and personal safety. Enel is adopting digital technology such
as Big Data, machine learning and automation on its power network in order to develop intelligent infrastructure that
reduces power outages and energy losses and manages distributed generation assets proactively. Enel has leveraged
machine learning solutions to boost plant efficiency in terms of heat rate and combustion optimisation. Enel is investing
in digital assets in the burgeoning renewable generation sector both for Engineering & Construction and for Operations
& Maintenance, reducing the time-to-market of new plants (and hence anticipating the benefits of CO,-free generation)
and increasing their generation output. For example, artificial intelligence is used to predict the power generated and
optimise maintenance programmes. Another aspect worth considering is that the effects of digitalization on the end
use of energy are doubled. Smart meters provide consumers with full awareness of their energy consumption, while
the new Enel X subCo provides customers with innovative energy services for efficiency, in addition to “smart” tech-
nological systems. This is reflected in major savings of energy consumption and CO, emissions.

Cloud

In 2019 the cloud was an essential strategic enabler for Enel, allowing the use of infrastructure and application IT re-
sources when required since, by exploiting the access possibilities made available by the network in full, it allows the
reduction of wastage deriving from the consumption of unused resources. The proportion of Enel applications on cloud
in 2019 reached 100%. The AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud used by Enel calls for the use of around 16% of the
energy required by conventional on premise infrastructure on average, allowing an average reduction of 88% in CO,
emissions, and it is hosted on green data processing centres 50% of whose energy requirements are obtained from
renewable sources.

People:

the decarbonization
contribution

of shared IT services

Alongside technological progress and the development of
new business opportunities, the central topic remains that
of Enel's people and their needs. In this regard, the Compa-
ny is continuing to pursue the internal digital transformation
process aimed at improving the digital skills of its people.
In light of this goal, Enel is committed to rethinking its cor-
porate processes, improving existing services and exploit-
ing the new opportunities offered by digital technology to

the full. For example, the “e-API Digital Ecosystem” was
adopted in the Group in 2019, to make data related to gen-
eration, e-mobility, customers, people, etc. available to all
in the various countries, guaranteeing a common platform
on which to share data among the different company areas.
