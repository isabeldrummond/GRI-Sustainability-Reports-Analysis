 

The target for increasing renewables capacity is expected

to rise by 14.1 GW (11.6 GW considering exclusively the net

installed capacity) in 2020-2022 and will be achieved through

a number of strategic lines of development:

> 5.4 GW will be developed in countries such as Italy,
Spain and Chile, where new investments in renewable
energy will support the decarbonization of the genera-
tion fleet;

> 5.1 GW will mainly be developed in Brazil and the Unit-
ed States, where an increasing number of large custom-
ers are moving from the regulated market to purchase
electricity from renewable sources developed primarily
through long-term power purchase agreements (PPA);

> 3.6 GW will be developed to support our presence in re-
cently opened markets or in entirely new markets, both
directly and through joint ventures.

Thanks to these initiatives, 60% of the Group’s total installed

capacity in 2022 will be renewable.

In order to support the decarbonization process, the plan

also envisages a significant contribution from the new flexi-

bility services provided by Enel X. Demand response capaci-

ty will expand from 6.3 GW in 2019 to over 10.1 GW in 2022,

while storage services will increase from the current 110

MW to about 440 MW in 2022

Electrification

Electrification, which means the substitution of electricity
for other commodities in energy consumption, will play a
central role in the Enel Group strategy.

In line with the IEA sustainable development scenario,
the share of electricity in final global energy consumption
should reach 43%° in 2040 (from 24% in 2018). This sce-
nario assumes a significant increase in the average annual

3 Figure referred to “useful energy”, intended as the energy that is available
to end-users to satisfy their needs (source IEA WEO 2019 SDS).

Commitment to the fight against climate change

investment for end use, which in 2030-2040 should be
almost 5 times that in 2018.

The opportunities deriving from this trend will involve a
broad spectrum of activities, ranging from distributed gen-
eration to energy efficiency upgrading for buildings and
electric vehicle infrastructure, thus supporting the growth
of companies that move first. Enel’s plan seeks to achieve
a stable market share in the free markets of European
countries, supported by a 65% increase in the number of
customers and 21% growth in volumes sold on the free
market in 2022.

Further impetus to the electrification process will come
from electric mobility, with the installation of about
736,000 recharging points by 2022, and more generally
from the new services offered by Enel X, which will
permit developing business models oriented towards pro-
moting the decarbonization of other industrial sectors and
services.

Enabling infrastructure

In order to adequately support value creation from these
two macro trends, the plan identifies electricity distribu-
tion network as one of the main enablers. The evolution of
the role of distributors will be a key factor in supporting the
greater complexity involved with distributed renewables
generation and electric mobility, in managing the digitaliza-
tion process driven by innovative services offered to cus-
tomers and in ensuring the resilience of the energy system
in view of the impacts of climate change. As a result, Enel
will continue to invest in network digitalization between
2020 and 2022, increasing the number of second genera-
tion smart meters from 13.1 million to 28.8 million.

Platforms and ecosystems

Enel will adopt a platform-based model on a global level
for its grids, in retail and in Enel X, which will make it pos-
sible to standardise and optimise the operating processes
by supporting the obtainment of the efficiencies set forth in
the Plan, and promote the establishment of new business
opportunities that promote an energy model that is free from
greenhouse gas emissions.
