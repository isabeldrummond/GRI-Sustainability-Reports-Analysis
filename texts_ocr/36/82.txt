access to dedicated demand response and energy effi-
ciency services (including a warning that available power
is being exceeded and the limiter is being activated, thus
providing a service that extends beyond simply displaying
the energy and power used and produced), the promotion
of awareness and home automation and the customi-
sation of tariffs, allowing the introduction of innovative
forms of contract.

Enel has also embarked on a challenging path aimed at re-
designing the value chain by adopting a circular econ-
omy model, to reduce environmental impacts by maxim-
ising the recovery of end-of-life products and materials.
The first example is the “Circular Smart Meter” project
launched in Italy and Brazil, which aims to reduce the envi-
ronmental footprint of smart meters through, for example,
the end-of-life use of their materials, starting with plastic
and copper. A proactive “circularity by design” approach
which integrates circularity right from the design stage,
as minimising the use of new natural resources also cuts
costs throughout the life cycle (from design, manufacture
and operation to scrapping), creating new efficiencies. In
designing and building the “Circular Smart Meter”, en-
vironmental and economic impacts had to be measured
in order to identify the most relevant components and
redesign them in a circular perspective, recovering and
regenerating waste such as plastic, copper, steel, etc. en-
hancing them for a second life as new network assets,
and finally exploring innovative tracking techniques for
reverse logistics. A long and complex process from the
engineering point of view, including comparative analyses

and laboratory tests, to guarantee the same reliability as
traditional meters. In Brazil, the “Circular Smart Meter”
is a virtuous example of how to promote a closed-loop
within the value chain by reusing waste material within
the same industrial cycles to produce the new generation
meter. The short-term goal is to apply the methodology
developed to other network assets as well, measuring the
expected benefits in economic, environmental and social
terms and then scaling the methodology to other busi-
ness operating processes

Rethinking one’s business by applying an ecosystem and
circular logic also means identifying new opportunities to
put customers at the centre, offering customised prod-
ucts and services, to build and strengthen a relationship
based on trust, transparency and rational use of energy,
particularly in innovative ways. Customer involvement
also requires constant listening: Enel wants to know
what its stakeholders think of services it offers and their
customer experience. For this reason, it carries out sur-
veys to measure the degree of satisfaction and uses spe-
cific communication channels in the various countries in
which it operates, in accordance with legal and regulatory
requirements. In Italy, for example, there is a telephone
infrastructure and innovative services that allow response
capability to be increased, thus providing information to
customers more quickly and accurately. For example, the
e-Notify service is available for E-Distribuzione, which al-
lows dedicated communications and alerts to be sent to
customers, as well as the Eddie chatbot, a virtual assistant
designed to inform and communicate with customers.

PAN is intended to improve performance and enable innovative management of the electricity network, integrating
the energy produced by local renewable distributed generation plants and guaranteeing customers constant access to
information on consumption trends. A 170 million euros project in response to the NER 300 European call for proposals
involving almost an entire region: 29,300 km of medium-voltage networks (91% of the total in Puglia), 102 primary
substations, around 8,000 secondary nodes, 45,000 distributed generation assets. In particular, the project provides for:
+> boosting the medium-voltage electricity network for greater efficiency and safety;

= the regional development of an electric vehicle charging infrastructure integrated into the distribution network, to

promote a new model of eco-sustainable mobility with zero emissions;
+> monitoring of energy consumption with the Smart Info+ kit for low-voltage zero-emission supplies.
