investments include the targeted replacement of un-
insulated lines with insulated conductors, increasing
the number of alternative routes to restore power
and the use of remote control systems to isolate the
section of the grid affected by the fault as quickly as
possible;

+> again in Italy, the measures to increase resilience are
contained in the three-year investment plan of E-Dis-
tribuzione and are designed to limit the risk of ser-
vice interruptions caused by the main critical factors
that may impact E-Distribuzione’s medium-voltage
grid. The measures for the 2017-2021 period involve
some 4 million customers and over 7,000 km of medi-
um-voltage lines;

> a subsequent “Readiness” phase that includes all
measures to improve the timeliness with which po-
tentially risky events are identified, ensuring coordi-
nation with the Civil Protection Department and local
officials, as well as to prepare intervention measures.
once a fault has occurred. Examples of measures in-
clude systems for forecasting meteorological events
and their impact on the grid, the provisioning of ad-
equate equipment to build temporary plant or emer-
gency grid structures, the preparation of operational
plans and the organisation of exercises. One of the
most important measures is certainly the definition
of agreements for the mobilisation of designated ex-
traordinary resources to respond to an emergency.
These include both internal resources and the re-
sources of contracting companies operating in other
areas of a country and/or in other countries;

Commitment to the fight against climate change

 

+ the third phase is the “Response” phase, meaning
the operational response capacity for a specific ex-
treme event, which is directly correlated with the abil-
ity to mobilise operational resources in the field and
with the availability of grid backup and redundancies;

+ the final phase is the “Recovery” phase, which seeks
to restore an acceptable and safe level of service in
the shortest possible time.

Response and Recovery are complementary. The philos-
ophy that guides interventions in these two phases is that
exceptional resources must be used to deal with excep-
tional events, and that all the available resources prepared
in the readiness phase must therefore be mobilised. The
assessment of the damage caused to the grid is the first
activity to be performed. Enel promptly activates a task
force of specialised technicians and deploys special equip-
ment (helicopters and generators) to restore service, and
mobilises personnel from other areas/countries. Great at-
tention is paid in these phases to communication with all
the players involved and the determination of the most
effective strategy to manage the repair of power lines and
the restoration of service to customers.

In this regard, the Enel Group in Italy is a permanent guest

of the Operations Committee of the National Civil Protec-

tion Department and has signed protocols with both the

National Civil Protection Department and Regional Civil

Protection Departments in order to facilitate communica-

tion in emergency situations, joint training and any other

initiative that makes collaboration with the civil protection
system more effective and rapid.
