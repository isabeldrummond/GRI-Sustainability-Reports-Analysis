In 2019 Enel carried out several initia-
tives aimed at engaging the Group's sig-
nificant stakeholders, namely companies.
and trade associations, customers, the
financial community, national and inter-

national institutions, civil society and lo-
cal communities, the media, employees,
vendors and contractors. On the basis of
the results of these initiatives, the priori-
ties assigned by the different categories
of stakeholders to the assessed issues
were identified. Enel responds to these
issues through the Sustainability Report,

supplying information concerning the
main activities and projects carried out in
the year. Moreover, Enel integrates the
results in question into the planning pro-
cess, setting targets and actions aimed
at continual improvement of its perfor-
mance in order to respond successfully
to its stakeholders’ expectations.
