Together with major European electric utilities, Enel is ac-
tively engaged in Bettercoal — a global initiative to promote
the continuous improvement of corporate responsibility in
the international coal industry. Bettercoal has released a
code of conduct based on existing and agreed standards of
social responsibility in the mining sector. This details guide-
lines which mining companies can refer to when drawing
up their own social, environmental and ethical policies. The
Bettercoal code tells suppliers what members expect from
their practices in relation to four main categories: manage-
ment; commitment to ethics and transparency; human
and labour rights; and environmental performance, while
promoting ongoing improvement. In 2019, it has started to
review the code to align it with the latest best practices in
sustainability, while gathering ideas and feedback from all
relevant stakeholders.

After signing a letter of commitment, the mining compa-
nies in the programme embarked on a virtuous path repre-
sented by the assurance system, accepting to undergo on-

Sustainable supply chain

site assessments carried out by independent third parties
to verify that the code’s principles have been applied, and
agreeing on an ongoing improvement plan to overcome any
shortcomings.

In addition to Bettercoal’s growing presence in various fo-
rums in the area of coal sustainability and supply chain, the
initiative has become an example of collaboration geared
towards improving socially responsible practices in the
supply chain. In 2019, Bettercoal evaluations covered over
400 mil t of coal production. Further reinforcement was giv-
en to two working groups dedicated specifically to Russia
and Colombia with clear and transparent work plans. In-
spections in four sites located in the USA, Colombia and
Kazakhstan were also carried out, with active monitoring
of 11 improvement plans. To promote greater transparen-
cy, four reports were published on the completed on-site
assessments, which are available to the public on the Bet-
tercoal website. Lastly, the United Nations Global Compact
Communication of Engagement and annual report with the
help of an external NGO were also published
