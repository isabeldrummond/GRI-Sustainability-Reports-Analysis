 

Enel has developed specific contractual clauses in all con-
tracts for works, services and supplies, which it updates
periodically to take into account the various legislation and
align with international best practices. The General Terms
and Conditions consist of a general section containing pro-
visions applicable to all countries, as well as the Country
Annex which contains specific provisions applicable in each
country of reference. In terms of sustainability of the sup-
ply chain, Enel requires its contractors/suppliers and sub-
contractors — among other things — to respect and protect
internationally recognised human rights, as well as ethical
and social obligations in terms of: child and female labour,
equal treatment, non-discrimination, freedom of associa-
tion and representation, forced labour, health, safety and
environmental protection, sanitary conditions and regula-
tions on wages, social security contributions, insurance
and tax. It also specifically requires suppliers to commit to
adopt and implement the principles of the Global Compact
and ensure that these are fulfilled by both their employees.
and subcontractors when carrying out all activities. Moreo-
ver, suppliers must undertake to respect the principles con-
tained in Enel's Code of Ethics, or at least take inspiration
from equivalent principles to Enel’s in managing its busi-
ness. Lastly, the “International Labour Organization” con-
ventions, or the applicable regulations in the country where
the activities are carried out if more restrictive, shall apply.
In these areas, Enel reserves the right to carry out any
checks or monitoring to verify compliance with the above

obligations by both the contractor and its subcontractors
or entities under its responsibility which are assigned to
