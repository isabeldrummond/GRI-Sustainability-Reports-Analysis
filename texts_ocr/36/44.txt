European Union and welcomes the results of the revision
of the EU ETS Directive for 2021-2030. The EU ETS makes
it possible to utilise the already existing framework harmo-
nised on a European level, which guarantees technological
neutrality and the uniform treatment of market operators.
To summarise, the EU ETS is the cornerstone of the EU's
climatic policies, which are also supplemented by other pol-
icies that permit reaching the climatic objectives while pro-
tecting the competitiveness of the EU’s industry system.
Based on these considerations, the Enel Group does not
favour the introduction of national carbon taxes (or a car-
bon price “floor”) in the EU's ETS sectors, as this would
significantly distort competition within the European single
market and increase the overall cost of reaching the desired
environmental result.

In areas outside of the European Union (such as Latin Amer-
ica), Enel's assets are increasingly covered by carbon pric-
ing schemes, mainly carbon taxes that are transformed into
“cap and trade” schemes, both national as well as through

regional connections, over the medium-long term.

Action platforms and partnerships
for facing climate change

 
 

The Group plays an active role in various sector associations
and organisations with the objective of promoting topics
regarding energy transition on a national and global level.
Some of the international associations with which Enel
collaborated actively in 2019 are listed below (see also the
“Sound governance” chapter).

Three Percent Club - The Group joined this platform
launched within the Energy Transition Coalition of the UN
Climate Action Summit held in September 2019. It is a plat-
form of 15 governments, 13 businesses and international
organizations committed to help put the world on the nec-
essary path to achieve the required improvements to meet
the Paris Agreement, driving a 3% annual global increase in
energy efficiency.

Climate Finance Leadership Initiative (CFLI) - Enel is a
founding partner of the initiative, launched by Michael R.
Bloomberg, inspired by the Secretary-General of the United
Nations and aimed to promote private sector investments in
response to climate change.

eurelectric - Under the chairmanship of Enel, eurelectric
adopted a long-term view of the European electrical sec-

Commitment to the fight against climate change

tor through which it is committed to reaching a zero carbon
emissions electrical energy mix in Europe much earlier than
2050 and to increasing energy efficiency and the electrifica-
tion of energy demand in order to mitigate the effects of cli-
mate change. Enel’s Chief Executive Officer ended his term
as Chairman in June 2019.

Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership (GSEP) - The
objective of the partnership is to guide sustainable energy
development by electrifying and connecting communities all
over the world. Enel will chair the GSEP for the 2019-2020
financial year, with the Enel X CEO acting as the Chairman,
and will host the executive meetings, promoting the best
electrification practices and encouraging its shareholders to
share examples of virtuous active partnerships as the topic
of the year.

Wind Europe - The aim of this association, guided by the
companies, is to promote national and international policies
and initiatives targeted towards reinforcing market develop-
ment infrastructures and technologies connected to wind
energy, on a European and global level. During 2019, Enel
was part of the Board of Directors and, overall, 13 of the 19
work groups and task forces.

Solar Power Europe - This company-led association repre-
sents various organisations that play an active role along the
entire value chain, with the objective of outlining the regu-
latory context and improving business opportunities related
to solar energy in Europe. Enel has been widely represented
within this association during 2018, by holding the position
of Vice-Chairman both for the Board of Directors as well as
the Strategic Committee and also by playing an active role in
different task forces during the course of the year.
SmartEn - SmartEn is a leading association in the digital
and decentralised energy solution sector that concentrates
on energy transition through intelligent cooperation among
consumer, grid, transmission and generation sectors which
all play an equally important role in an integrated energy sys-
tem. In 2019, Enel played an active role in the Board of Direc-
tors as well as in various work groups that were established
to promote sustainable decentralised energy solutions.
E.DSO for Smart Grids - The European Distribution Sys-
tem Operators (E.DSO) is the primary interface between
distributors and European institutions by promoting large-
scale development and the experimentation of technolo-
gies for smart grids in real situations, as well as new mar-
ket and regulatory models aimed at reaching the European
Union's energy and climate objectives. Enel is the Vice-Chair-
man of the Board of Directors together with other players of
