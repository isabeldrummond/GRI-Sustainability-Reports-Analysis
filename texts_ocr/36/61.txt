Acute physical risks

With regard to acute physical phenomena, the incidence
and frequency of extreme physical phenomena can cause
significant and unexpected physical damage to assets and
generate negative externalities associated with the interrup-
tion of service.

To assess the scale of the risks of extreme climate events,
the scenario results will be assessed in terms of the fre-
quency and intensity of the key phenomena, together with
technical information on generation assets, taking account
of the differing levels of resilience, and identifying metrics
to measure potential losses and any externalities caused by
the interruption of business operations.

The intensification of the effects of climate change means it
is essential to adopt adaptive behaviours: each catastroph-
ic event represents a lesson learned for Enel, from which
we draw inspiration to strengthen design techniques and
preventive measures to ensure the resilience of the asset
portfolio.

From this perspective, the method and the information ex-
tracted from the ex post analysis of events play a crucial role
in determining the processes and practices to be deployed
in mitigating such events in the future.

Power generation

As regards generation, over time the Group has implement-

ed targeted measures at specific sites and established ad

hoc management activities and processes.

Measures implemented for specific sites in recent years

include:

+> improving cooling water management systems for cer-
tain plants in order to counter the problems caused by
the decline in water levels on rivers, such as the Po in
Italy;

+ installing fogging systems to improve the flow of inlet
air and offset the reduction in power output caused by
the increase in ambient temperature in CCGTs;

+ installing drainage pumps, raising embankments, peri-
odic cleaning of canals and interventions to consolidate
land adjacent to plants to prevent landslides in order to
mitigate flood risks.

The Group adopts a series of best practices to manage the

impact of weather events on power generation, such as:

+> weather forecasting both to monitor renewable re-
source availability and detect extreme events, with
warning systems to ensure the protection of people and
assets;

60

+ insurance policies, to cover damage to assets and the
negative externalities caused, for example, by lost elec-
tricity generation;

> the real-time remote monitoring of electricity power
plants;

+ safe rooms in areas exposed to tornadoes and hurri-
canes, such as the wind plants in Oklahoma in the Unit-
ed States.

In addition, in order to ensure rapid response to adverse
events, the Group has adopted specific emergency man-
agement procedures with protocols for real-time communi-
cation and management to restore operations rapidly and
standard checklists for damage assessment and the safe
return to service for all plants as rapidly as possible.

Infrastructure & Networks
The Enel Group's Infrastructure and Networks Global
Business Line has adopted a more complex and innova-
tive approach to respond to such extreme events de-
nominated “4R”, in addition to the measures already
envisaged to upgrade and improve the electricity dis-
tribution grid. This new approach has been structured
over the past few years in a body of documentation that
governs the measures to be taken in preparation for a grid
emergency once the damage has been caused. More spe-
cifically, the 4R strategy comprises:
+> aninitial “Risk prevention” phase, which includes all
actions to reduce the probability of losing grid compo-
nents due to an event and/or to minimise its effects.
This is pursued both through measures to enhance the
robustness of grid infrastructure in extreme weather
events and maintenance measures. Measures to re-
inforce the grid have been implemented not only to
improve service quality in general, but also to reduce
the risk of prolonged or widespread outages in the
event of a malfunction, using a probabilistic approach
This approach has mainly been used to reduce the
risk of outages at critical installations (primary substa-
tions) or for particular grid configurations (where no
alternative power supply routes are available);
> in Italy, to prevent service interruptions due to the
breakage of overhead power lines as a result of snow-
fall, the risk of such interruptions has been assessed
on the basis of the probability of losing segments of
the grid and then calculating the relative impact in
terms of customers without power and the loss in
terms of power not delivered. To address these risks,
