includes education and professional training projects for
the start-up of production companies and support for lo-
cal agricultural development.

> Cerro Iglesias (Panama): a rural zone without access
to electric energy near the Cerro Iglesias hydroelec-
tric power plant. It was illuminated thanks to a creat-
ing shared value project together with the Oficina de
Electrificacién Rural (OER) of the Prime Minister of the
Republic of Panama. Thanks to the joint effort with lo-
cal authorities, today almost 2 thousand residents of the
community located in the Panamanian district of Nole
Duima, in the comarca of Ngabe-Buglé, receive electric-
ity in their homes. The project has make it possible to
build approximately 14 km of transmission line, install
263 street illumination plants and electrify 423 homes.
It is sustainable and renewable energy that permits the
residents of the small village today to have illuminated
roads and the electricity needed to power their local
business activities, schools and health care system.

> Marginal city areas and rural electrification for in-
digenous communities (Chile): the purpose of the
initiative is to improve living conditions for more than
200 families that live in the Medialuna camp, located in
the municipality of Lampa. Enel Distribucion and Fun-
dacion Techo have created an alliance that has produced
the initial result of constructing a “community centre”
that will be powered by renewable energy from pho-
tovoltaic panels, provided with air conditioning and ef-
ficient lighting systems. This space not only offers a
new meeting point and a recreation area, it will also be
the ideal place for developing seminars suitable for the
entire community: training courses to reinforce working
skills and educational activities such as waste manage-
ment, the installation of recycling points or the creation
of a community garden. This project will be extended
to residential customers in a vulnerable situation who
live in the Enel concession area. The initiatives for im-
proving access to energy for indigenous communities
located near the company plants are still continuing. For
example, in the rural community of Pehuén di Callaqui,
Alto Bio Bio, in the VIII Region of Chile, 52 families have
benefited from the installation of electrical systems in
their homes. The systems were supplied complete with
electrical lines and the relative authorisations, with the
installation of material outside and outside the homes,
thereby guaranteeing the quality of the service supplied.

+> Project Ecoenel (Brazil): the project, which was

Community and shared value

launched in 2007, allows providing discounts for the
electricity bill for all customers who recycle their waste
and bring it to specific collection points. In 2019, this pro-
ject was also extended to the state of San Paolo, as well
as the states of Rio de Janeiro, Ceara and Goias in Brazil.
The project also includes specific training on aware and
efficient energy consumption (“Enel Shares Efficien-
cy”). Furthermore, visits were also made to customer
homes to evaluate the possibility of accessing the so-
cial tariff and provide information about efficient energy
use. In 2019, the EcoEnel project reached approximately
180,000 direct beneficiaries (vulnerable customers who
are facilitated), recycled 59,000 t of waste, created 240
eco collection points and involved 43 municipalities.
+> Fundacion Pachacutec (Peru): this institute, which is
located near the coastal area of Ventanilla, in the prov-
ince of Callao, promotes professional courses in indus-
trial electric technology for low-income business own-
ers and local youth who want to start their professional
development in the electric sector. The participants had
the opportunity to work as part of the staff of the E-Dis-
tribuzione contractors in Peru or to start their own small/
mediumrsized local business. The courses, which were
also carried out by Enel employees on a voluntary basis,
helped 90% of the almost 700 beneficiaries of the pro-
gramme to enter the working world in the electrical sec-
tor. A good part of the people finishing the course were
women, who had the possibility to start their profession
in a sector that normally was considered only for men.
As regards strategic partnerships, the project carried out
with Liter of Light was completed, which promoted work-
shops targeted towards the construction and maintenance
of small solar generation units that use plastic bottles and
other recycled materials. More than 2,500 solar kits were
distributed through the workshop in schools in Peru, Chile,
Argentina, Romania, South Africa, Brazil and Italy. By means
of learning-by-doing, the workshop allowed students to learn
about the possibilities deriving from material recycling from
the point of view of a circular economy (through the recon-
version of kerosene lamps into electric lamps powered by
solar energy), and open source lighting technologies. Fur-
thermore, Enel is contributing towards the programme of the
Brazilian government (“Electricity Social Tariff"), in favour
of low-income families, which offers discounts for energy
bills up to a reduction of 65% of the normal residential rate.
