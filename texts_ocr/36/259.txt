calculated using statistical models or benchmarks. A re-

the elimination of oil equipment with PCB reduces the
tisk of contamination of a compound no longer in pro-
duction since the 1980s and classified as ecotoxic and
bioaccumulable;
the calculation of CO, avoided. The energy saving esti-
mation model takes into account: the number of low-
loss transformers replacing traditional transformers;
operations on the MV network; network upgrading me-
asures; the new transformer rooms, which involve opti-
mizing the grid in terms of reducing low-voltage lines in
favor of higher-voltage ones.
Table C “Further ESG indicators” shows, where possible
and appropriate®, as envisaged in the “second party opin-
ion" the following indicators for the renewable projects:

period of construction of the plant or the period fol-
lowing its entry into operation. In the case of plants

are considered to be relevant.

4 The indicator “Material reused/recycled after revamping” is not applicable,

The above indicators in Table C, with the exception of water

consumption and plant shutdown due to environmental issues,

also refer to Infrastructure and Networks projects.

Table D “Overall information” refers to the criteria, indica-

‘tors, overall information and approach chosen by Enel to de-

velop the projects financed through the proceeds of the bond.

The data have been thoroughly calculated on the basis of the

results of Enel's accounting, non-accounting and other infor-

mation systems, and validated by the persons responsible in

each case. The data determined through the use of estimates

and related calculation method have been expressly indicated.
