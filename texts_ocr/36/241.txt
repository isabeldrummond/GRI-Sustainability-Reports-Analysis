The process provides the continuous and direct engagement
of Company's external and internal stakeholders, including
its top managers, through one-to-one interviews, surveys
and other tools.

In 2019 the process of identifying and prioritising categories of
stakeholders involved the Company's top management, which
assessed the priority of the categories on the basis of a survey
administered by the Holding’s Sustainability unit according to the
following parameters: dependence (importance of the relationship
for the stakeholder), influence (importance of the relationship for

240

‘the Company) and tension (the timing aspect of the relationship).
In addition, the various units involved each year in the analysis
process and those responsible for relations with stakeholders
are tasked with engaging them according to the most appropri-
ate methods in view of the communications channels (generic,
specific and participatory), the type of relations with the group con-
cerned and the context of reference.

The most relevant categories identified in the analysis and
the respective communications and engagement channels
are shown in the table on this page.
