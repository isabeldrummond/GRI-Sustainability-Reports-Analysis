In September 2019, Enel participated in the United Nations Climate Action Summit, the most important global event
on climate change, gathering Heads of States, corporate as well as civil society and policy leaders to take increasing
ambitious actions to address this challenge, also by pushing for the transformation of economies in line with the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The Summit, which was the first event of its kind to be convened by UN Secretary-General, focused on a set of action 8
areas, including the energy transition, climate finance and carbon pricing, as well as infrastructure and cities, to boost
ambition and accelerate action to implement the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Enel played a crucial role participating in the Energy Transition Coalition track, being involved in the Italian flagship
initiative “Catalysing the Energy Transition through Digital Power Infrastructure” which aims at catalysing the
energy transition by promoting digital infrastructures and renewable energy, particularly in developing countries.
Furthermore, Enel’s CEO, attended also the UN Private Sector Forum. Hosted by the UN Secretary-General and
organised by the UN Global Compact, the event gathered Chief Executives, young climate leaders, Heads of State
and Government as well as UN leaders on the occasion of the Summit, stirring a multi- stakeholder, intergenerational
dialogue to share an urgent and collective course of action in tackling the climate crisis.
Enel’s proactive engagement and leadership was highlighted through the commitment to two important pledges on
the occasion of the Summit:
— Business Ambition for 1.5°C - Our Only Future, through which Enel committed to reach net-zero emissions
by no later than 2050, in line with limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 °C with respect to pre-industrial
levels;
— Just transition & green, decent jobs, through which Enel committed to promote a just energy transition while
respecting the international labour standards across its business.
Further information on the pledges and its implementation can be found in the present chapter.
