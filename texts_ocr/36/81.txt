erate in various capacities on the grid infrastructure, Enel
carries out continuous grid development and efficiency
measures. Maintenance and modernisation work on the
grid is carried out to reduce the number and duration of
service interruptions. This also allows real-time monitor-
ing, guaranteeing timely intervention to repair faults and
ensure an optimum energy supply. In this context, remote
control systems play a key role, allowing local operating
centres to carry out all the operations necessary to ensure
continuity of the electricity service provided. Even from
the point of view of network losses, digitalization of the
infrastructure and the use of a remote management sys-
tem, combined with the use of electronic smart meters,
allow greater effectiveness to be achieved in monitoring
energy balances, while reducing fraud and enabling new
services that market operators can offer to customers.

After several years of experience with smart grids, Enel
has launched a new enabling technology known as Net-
work Digital Twin®, a 3D digital model that faithfully
replicates the electricity infrastructure, from its individual
physical elements to the most complex operational dy-
namics. It is a large-scale application of Industry 4.0 tech-
nology, which integrates network automation, the Internet
of Things and 3D modelling with advanced data manage-
ment (machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc.). In
addition to improving network management, it allows an
open ‘ecosystem’ to be created to encourage information
sharing for the benefit of people and cities, improving the
quality of the service, the relationship and the involve-
ment of all stakeholders. Thanks to the advanced plat-
forms, therefore, more information can be made available
and the data from the electricity grid can be accessed in
amore timely and detailed manner, promoting awareness
of the use of energy, efficiency and savings. As part of the
ity” project, in October 2019, the dis-
trict of Vila Olimpia in Sao Paulo, Brazil, saw the launch
of Latin America’s first Network Digital Twin, which
improves urban resilience and creates opportunities for
an extraordinary range of new services and benefits for
the cities of the future on an infinitely larger scale that is
more compatible with the gigantic dimensions that demo-
graphic projections envisage for megacities by 2050. This
project shows that the digitalization of electricity grids,
buildings and urban infrastructure can take place in a real
living laboratory. Citizens, business owners, municipal-
ities and universities can co-create innovative solutions

that integrate infrastructure with local needs, such as mo-

bility, safety, waste reduction and the urban environment.
Smart meters are the cornerstone of distribution net-
work innovation and digitalization work, the driving force
behind urban redevelopment and fundamental enablers
of advanced home automation. From the beginning, their
installation has been accompanied by specific information
and awareness campaigns, given that energy savings of
10% can be achieved by using this technology, particular-
ly thanks to the real-time availability of energy use infor-
mation. By the end of 2019, 44.7 million end users had an
active smart meter and 13.1 million end users had second
generation meters (CE2G). In addition to transmitting de-
tailed measurement data (daily four-hour load curves) to
the concentrator, the latter provide a customer-dedicated
communication channel called “Chain 2”, which allows
data to be sent between the CE2G and in-home devic-
es. Greater transparency of information relating to ener-
gy use, energy exchanges with the grid and production
in the case of “prosumer” users is possible and the de-
velopment of the home automation and active demand
market is encouraged. Customers therefore become pro-
tagonists and have the opportunity to participate in the
energy market and be remunerated for offering flexibility
to the electricity system, reducing or increasing energy
use or production/input. In particular, “Chain 2” provides
