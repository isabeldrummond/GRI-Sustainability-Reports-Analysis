 

At the Enel Group, the path for applying a new communi-
ty relations model started in 2015 with the adoption of a
Creating Shared Value (CSV) model that integrates social-en-

vironmental factors into business processes and along the
entire value chain. The dissemination of this method re-
quired a consolidation path within the Company on a cultural
and operative level. In 2016, Policy no. 211 “CSV Process
definition and management” was published. It defines how
sustainability must permeate company processes across
the board, making it a shared responsibility. This policy was
supplemented by issuing an operating instruction (no. 1768
“Project Portfolio Management System”), which represents
the approach along Enel’s entire value chain in terms of pro-
ject identification and characterisation as well as its mapping
on the dedicated digitalized platform (Project Portfolio Man-
agement System); management of the quality assurance
process; calculation of beneficiaries; evaluation of project
impact. The CSV model applies to the entire value chain with
particular reference to business development, engineering,
construction and procurement operations as well as asset
management and maintenance. The model has six phases,
as specified in the figure on the previous page.

An inclusive approach towards stakeholders also includes
circular economy solutions. The infrastructures of plants
being decommissioned can be reconverted to serve other
purposes for promoting the territory by involving the various
stakeholders. Another example is the “sustainable” man-
agement of the construction sites in order to minimise their
impacts (thanks, for example, to the installation of photo-
voltaic solar panels to satisfy a part of the energy demand,
the adoption of water saving measures, including installing
water tanks and rainwater collection systems and the use

110

of electric vehicles for transporting workers from the city
to the construction site and for their movements within the
construction site) and promote the development of this ap-
proach by involving local workers

The definition and dissemination of the guidelines on the
use of CSV applications, the preparation and assessment of
the sustainability projects, the management of the projects
on a Group level and the dissemination of the best practices
in the countries in which the company operates are guaran-
teed by the Holding’s Innovability (Innovation and Sustaina-
bility) organisational structure and by the relative sustaina-
bility structures in the various countries of operation. During
2019, the Sustainability Functions were established also on
a Business Line level, which testifies to the process of inte-
grating sustainability at all the subsidiaries. Each country and
each Business Line adapts the procedures for the global pol-
icy and the procedures for application of the CSV model on
a local level, based on the specific aspects of business and
the context. In 2019, there were 1,375 applications of the
CSV model’ across the various phases of the value chain

3. An application is interpreted as the use of at least one CSV tool in relation
to an asset, in any phase of the value chain and in any Business Line.
The CSV applications in the BD phase include applications regarding BD
opportunities (also at the beginning phases) and business projects output
leaving the pipeline. They can also relate to assets in O&M in the case of
modernising projects or decommissioning activities. The CSV applications
in the E&C phase can refer to assets passed to the O&M phase at the end
of the year. The number of CSV applications in Infrastructure & Networks
(I&N) may refer to the concession area, but also areas identified by muni-
Cipalities and substations. As regards the NFS perimeter (excluding com-
panies consolidated using the equity method, foundations and non-profit,
organisations of the Group, and the companies for which the BSO - Build,
Sell and Operate mechanism was applied) the number of applications for
2019 equals 1,318 in relation to 699 in 2018)
