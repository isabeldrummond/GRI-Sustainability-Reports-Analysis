Climate change, global population growth, technological ac-
celeration and shifting geopolitical balances are among the
main forces that are shaping the ongoing watershed moment.
Today's scenario has been made even more complex by the
recent outbreak of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic in vari-
ous parts of the world. In response to this emergency, we have
acted promptly and with determination to reduce the risk of
contagion to a minimum, while ensuring continuity of the ser-
vice we provide and the security of the power system in all the
countries we operate in. These concrete actions, supported by
technology and innovation, allow us to bring the best of our
experiences to bear in different contexts and to adopt the most
effective solutions rapidly and uniformly, thereby ensuring that
the orderly performance of our work in service of communities
remains sustainable, even in such adverse conditions.
Sustainability is a driving force that helps us tackle challeng-
es and work together to forge a new model of development
that leaves no one behind. To Enel, this is a commitment
that we have sought to instill into our purpose: “Open Power
for a brighter future. We empower sustainable progress”
We wish to contribute to a world in which energy is always at
the service of the community to drive development, growth
and a higher quality of life for all. We are convinced that, in or-
der to generate lasting profit, value must be shared within the
entire community around us. This is why we have prioritized
addressing climate change, a just energy transition and contin-
ually ethical, transparent relations with all our stakeholders. In
our vision, progress springs from ideas and co-creation and is
nourished by values such as trust, responsibility, proactivity
and innovation.

With this in mind, in 2015 we revolutionized our growth mod-
el, adopting a strategy that puts sustainability at the centre of
the value chain, makes digitalization a key element at all levels
and in all processes within the Company and sees renewable
energy as the driver of growth. Our 2019 results clearly reflect
the steps taken and the Company's profound transformation.
Today we are leaders in all the main areas of the energy
transition and a global operator in over 30 countries with
approximately 70 million customers, 2.2 million km of
grids and 46 GW of managed' renewable capacity. An-
other milestone we reached in 2019 is that, for the first time,
installed capacity from renewables exceeded that of thermoe-
lectric sources. We are a more efficient and remunerative com-
pany, with a stronger ability to adapt rapidly to change and inno-
vate, including with financial instruments, where we launched
the world’s first bonds directly linked to the UN sustainability
goals (SDG-inked bonds). A commitment that will continue
into the 2020-2022 period, contributing to the achievement of
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We
are preparing our grid infrastructure and customer manage-
ment processes to best meet the challenges of the future by
investing in the digital transformation. Having completed the
migration of all IT services to the cloud is a crucial step towards
developing platform-based business models that will help us

tes and joint ventures (approximately 3.7 GW)

Letter to stakeholders

support electrification of consumption, sustain the fight against
climate change while ensuring a constant supply of sustain-
able, accessible energy. This migration of IT services to the
cloud allows us to face the pandemic with flexible, remote
working methods that minimize the risk of contagion, without
an adverse effect on operations. We also remain committed to
developing a business model in line with the goals of the
Paris Agreement to keep the average increase in global tem-
perature below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue
efforts to limit this increase to 1.5 °C. We have therefore set a
new objective for 2030, which envisages a 70% reduction of
CO, emissions per kWh compared to 2017 levels, as certified
by the SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative), a global initiative
that validates company decarbonization strategies. A signifi-
cant step towards achieving the goal of full decarbonization of
our generation capacity by 2050, supported by investments in
renewables’ growth and in the progressive reduction of power
generated from thermoelectric sources.

The centrality of individuals and communities, a sustaina-
ble supply chain, sound governance, occupational health
and safety and a focus on the environment reinforce and
complete the Group's sustainability strategy. Thanks to the
energy, know-how and common vision of Enel’s people, we
are capable of managing the constantly evolving complexi-
ties, while maintaining our commitments to the market. In
an era of change, the transition needs to be just, and for this
to occur, the priority must be supporting individuals by pro-
moting training and the development of skills, diversity and
inclusion. With upskilling and reskilling programs, we are
able to advance existing skillsets, while also helping talented
and capable individuals grow, by creating new roles to meet
the needs of ceaseless technological progress and innovation
processes. Training increasingly becomes a partner in the
growth of all individuals, stimulating ambition, self-study
and a proactive spirit, while also sharing a wealth of knowl-
edge, attitudes and passions

Adopting a sustainable strategy and business model that
are centered on innovation and circularity allows us to face
the climate emergency and guarantee growth in a context
of limited resources, while ensuring social inclusion and
cohesion and promoting a perfect alignment of values,
the economy and finance. Therefore, making it possible to
achieve lasting, shared success, navigating the discontinu-
ities we are experiencing this year and creating new devel-
opment opportunities, not only for individuals but also for
society as a whole.
