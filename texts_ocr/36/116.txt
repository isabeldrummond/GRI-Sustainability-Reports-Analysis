Enel's 2020-2022 Strategic Plan confirms the Group's at-
tention to aspects such as growth of renewables and the
development of low-carbon technologies, such as the
digitalization of the grids, installation of charging stations,
software platforms and public lighting, thereby abandoning
investments in coal plants and the construction of large in-
frastructure projects with a high environmental impact. This
strategy helps the Group be more flexible and minimise
the impacts on the ecosystem, territory and community.
Presence in such a vast geographic perimeter of countries
and regions necessarily calls for the evaluation of very dif-
ferent scenarios and radical knowledge of each area and
the needs of the various stakeholders in order to identify
targeted solutions. Each infrastructure project is discussed
therefore, with evaluations by the community and involved
stakeholders, which could involve criticism or partial ac-
ceptance in some cases, especially when related to reset-
tlement activities. In these latter cases, the Group may be
exposed to reputational risks, also in relation to their inter
action with local suppliers, as well as operational risks relat-
ed to delays in executing projects or completing them, with
possible repercussions on the supply chain. The involve-
ment of the stakeholders in the processes for the planning
and development of the infrastructure is of fundamental
importance, especially if the construction of a new plant
involves the resettlement of a part of the resident popula-
tion in the surrounding areas. Resettlement management
must involve the population and the concerned persons as
well as a close evaluation of the psychological and social
problems that are possible at an individual and collective
level. The approach in selecting potential sites is therefore
to minimise as much as possible the need to move the
population. This is done by analysing the economic, polit-
ical, cultural and social-demographic aspects, including an
analysis of the daily life of the communities that live in the
area of influence, the distribution of the population, the
organisational forms, the employment and remuneration
levels. In the cases in which resettlement is confirmed,

Community and shared value

the project is carried out in compliance with applicable in-
ternational standards, considering possible impacts on the
different forms of physical, human, economic, environmen-
tal and cultural capital of the concerned populations. Any
resettlement projects will be carried out in compliance with
the applicable legislation of the involved country, including
the local regulations that specify the conditions for resettle-
ment and the methods for calculating the related economic
compensation. Enel's sensitivity regarding this issue is also
reflected in the Human Rights Policy approved in 2013 by
the Board of Directors (see chapter “Sound governance”).
A description is provided below of the most significant cas-
es in progress related to plants constructed in the past but
that present residual areas of criticality, the positive and/
or negative impacts (actual or ‘feared’) on the territory and
the way in which the concerned Group companies are pro-
moting a proactive dialogue to reach solutions that are as
widely shared as possible.

Bocamina plant (Chile)

The Bocamina II plant is a 350 MW coal-fired thermoelectric
power plant whose construction started in 2007 in the mu-
nicipality of Coronel, Region of Bio Bio, in Chile. The plant is
part of the Bocamina coal-fired thermoelectric power plant,
whose first unit, 128 MW, was built in the 60s and put in op-
eration in the 1970. The second unit was built in an area next
to the first, with approximately 1,300 families living nearby.
When the construction of the second unit started, the initial
agreements were signed in the area of the municipality of
Coronel with the families of the communities near the plant.
At the end of 2019, out of a total of 1,337 families, 1,237
were relocated. The method for relocating families has been
completely reviewed and aligned with the main applicable
international standards, including standard IFC no. 5 “Land
Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement”.

Starting in January 2017, Enel started a detailed analysis pro-
