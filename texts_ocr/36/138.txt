aligned with the Group's objectives. The cyber security strat-
egy and initiatives are recurring topics that are subject to the
Group's principal executive and control bodies (e.g. “Board
of Directors”, “Control and Risks Committee”, “Supervisory
Bodies”, etc.).

In 2017 the Company also set up a specific “Cyber Security
Framework" policy, which orients principles, organisation
and operating processes for a global strategy of analysis,
prevention and management of the risks and effects of cy-
ber attacks. This framework is based ona “systemic” vision
that integrates traditional Information Technology sector (IT)
with the Operational Technology sector (OT), connected to
the world of industry and the Internet of Things (loT). In the
context of the creation of this framework, 2017 saw the
definition also of the new Cyber Security Risk Management
methodology applicable to all IT, OT and loT environments,
which specifies all the necessary phases required to perform
a risk analysis and define the associated mitigation plan, in
line with the stated cyber security objectives. Enel has also
created a “Cyber Emergency Readiness Team” (CERT)
for proactive management and response to cyber incidents
while collaborating and exchanging information within a net-
work of accredited international partners. The existing ac-
creditation agreements with the institutional CERTs in the
countries in which Enel operates were upgraded in 2019.
Following signing of the agreement with the US national
CERT, the number of accreditations has now reached 9: Ro-
mania, Italy, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Spain
and the US. Also in 2019 the collaboration proceeds with
the Trusted Introducer Service, which includes more than
380 CERTs in over 60 countries, and with “FIRST” (Forum
of Incident Response and Security Teams), the largest and
most wide ranging community in the sector, with over 510
members in more than 90 countries. Finally, the Enel CERT
Global Control room in Turin was upgraded in 2019: another
step forward in the consolidation and reinforcement of the
Group's cyber security strategy.

incident management

Every day, CERT collects more than 2 billion events from
more than 3,700 data sources related to the corporate assets,

correlating them and producing around one hundred “inci-
dents” (cases requiring treatment). The incidents are classi-

Innovation and digitalization

fied in accordance with a specific evaluation matrix (Enel Cy-
ber Impact Matrix) on a scale from 0 to 4 that considers both
the level of their impact and the level of the existing tools
protecting company assets. The majority of incidents identi-
fied had no significant impact on Group systems and were
automatically or semi-automatically blocked and/or managed
by existing company defences (level 0/1). Incidents classified
at levels 2/3/4 potentially have an impact on the Group and
they are managed by the CERT analysts, bringing in the ap-
propriate units in question in accordance with processes and
actors that are predetermined during the monitoring service
set-up phase. In 2019 CERT responded to 94 level “2” cyber
incidents and 10 level “3” incidents. In all cases

 

detected, all the procedures provided were activated and no
significant damage ensued in respect of company assets. No
level “4” cyber security incidents were recorded.

If a cyber security incident were to involve a possible data
violation, the appropriate and necessary actions would be un-
dertaken immediately, in line with the specific Group policy
on “Personal Data Management”. If a crisis situation should
arise such that threatens business continuity of the Company,
and/or the assets, reputation, and/or profitability of the Enel
Group, the appropriate and necessary actions would be un-
dertaken immediately, in line with the specific Group policy
concerning “Critical Events Management”.

CERT allowed Enel to block the following daily threats

in 2019:

> approximately 2 milli

> approximately 300 viruses;

> approximately 400 thousand at risk connections in
outbound emails;

+> approximately 120 attacks on institutional portals.

The number of connections to dangerous sites in 2019 fell

thanks to the extension of the technical countermeasures

 

inbound malicious or spam emails;

adopted and the increase in the level of protection of Inter-
net navigation, in relation to the extension of the perimeter
of countries covered.

Moreover, by means of Threat Intelligence services, in 2019
Enel detected more than 1,300 Internet domains engaged
in illicit use of the trade mark for the probable purpose of
perpetrating fraud against customers, and reported them to
the competent authorities.

Furthermore, more than 800 safety checks were carried out
in the sphere of IT and OT, this number representing an in-
crease of 60% versus the checks carried out in 2018.
