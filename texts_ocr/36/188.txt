Enel is furthermore committed to maintaining the manage-
ment of the biodiversity aligned with industry best practices.
With this in mind, in 2019, Enel adopted Group Guidelines on

the management of biodiversity in the development of new
projects up to operation and decommissioning.

Moreover, with the objective to involve and create increased
awareness of biodiversity conservation, an internal commu-
nication campaign was launched featuring some of the most
significant projects carried out over the year. In conjunction
with the communication campaign, an internal photogra-
phy competition to represent examples of the integration
of the biodiversity with the Group infrastructures was also
launched.

In 2019, 114 projects for the protection of species and
natural habitats were launched, with an overall investment
of 8.9 million euros to recover 1,300 hectares of habitat”.

10 The reduction of zones with biodiversity projects compared to 2018 (3.9
million hectares) and of the number of projects (157 in 2018) is due to
the application of the increasingly restrictive measures in determining
the areas that require to be monitored and analysed within the scope of
biodiversity projects.

Environmental sustainability

These projects operate mainly in Brazil, Chile, Spain and It-
aly, and mostly involve technologies such as hydroelectric,
wind and electricity networks. Examples of the biodiversity
mitigation measures through the related policy are available
on the site’s Sustainability section https://www.enel.com/
investors/biodiversity. Some measures are implemented
during the plant work site phase (for example, during the
construction of the power plant), others take longer to imple-
ment and include long-term off-setting (for example, the fish
re-stocking project at the El Quimbo plant).
