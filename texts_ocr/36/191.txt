vate parties. The data is transmitted from the fast (Juice Pump)
and quick (JuicePole and Pole Station) infrastructures equipped
with an internal measuring device and from the connected Jui-
ceBoxes installed at home.

The calculation of CO, saved is a combination of the data on the
distance travelled by 100% electric-powered vehicles (BEV) or
plugin hybrids (PHEV) only using electricity and the calculation
of the mean consumptions of vehicles from a recent official
study by the Milan Polytechnic. The findings compare the kilo-
metres that can be travelled with the average emissions from
endothermic vehicles circulating in Italy published annually by
ISPRA (the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and
Research) net of the CO, emitted to produce energy based
on the national energy mix. To reinforce the algorithm, Enel
X converted the amount of CO, saved from the environment
into the number of trees that would have absorbed this same
quantity of emissions over a year. The result is measured by the
relationship between the quantity of CO, a tree absorbs (2019
refinement to the 2006 IPCC guidelines for National Greenhou-
se Gas inventories) and those of the saved emissions, thereby
obtaining the number of equivalent trees which contribute to
the “fourwheel forest” which every Enel X client creates by
responsible behaviour towards their surrounding environment.
This algorithm was developed in Italy, but was designed to be
used in other countries taking into account the average CO,
emissions of the vehicle fleet circulating in the territory (CO/
km) and the emissions of the national energy mix (CO /kWh).
The dashboard is available for users on the homepage of the
Enel X website; the calculation of the CO, saved by each indivi-
dual recharging session will soon be available on the JuicePass
app and on the Recharge Manager portal, dedicated to busi-
nesses and public services. Enel X will furthermore introduce
a system for viewing the aggregated data related to the emis-
sions saved also on the recharging displays of the JuicePole
and JuicePump infrastructure. Thanks to recharges, 6,800 t of
CO, have been saved — the equivalent of 379,000 trees

Distribution

In order to protect the countryside and the whole country,
Global Infrastructure and Networks have adopted specific
strategies to mitigate the environmental impacts of building
activities related to new networks in addition to upgrades to
existing networks.

The cabling ratio is the relationship {in percentages) betwe-
en the lengths of the cable lines and the total length of the li-

190

nes, showing immediately the mitigation of the environmen-
tal impacts of the electric lines. The increase in this index
over time is due to an increase in the length of overhead and
underground cable lines, reducing the quota of bare conduc-
tors; with benefits in terms of the resilience of the network,
curtailing plant-cutting activities and a drastic reduction in the
tisk of electrocution for birdlife.

In 2019, the confirmed cable ratio was 60.1%, also due to
the significant contribution of the Brazilian companies in Rio
de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. This percentage is in line with the
targets set for the next five years

The reduction of network losses is guaranteed through inter
ventions which also contribute to reducing CO, emissions.
These actions focus on power plants, and aim, for example,
to progressively reduce single-phase electric lines as well as
the construction of new electric lines to lighten the load on
the pre-existing ones in addition to the use of low-loss tran-
sformers. Other actions include boosting the grid by using
conductors with a greater cross-section and rephasing primary
transformer. Finally, the realisation of new transformer cabins
will help reduce the length of the low-voltage lines which are
characterised by higher levels of loss. More broadly, optimising
the network asset will allow a significant reduction of its losses.

Fuel deposit and movement

Storage tanks for liquid fuels (oil and gas with adjacent pi-
pelines) and solid fuels (coal and lignite located at dedicated
ports) are monitored in terms of resource usage, consump-
tion of electrical energy, emissions (air quality), wastewaters
and wastes.

Sustainable construction sites

From 2013 onwards, the Enel Group launched a report on the
main environment performance indicators relating to con-
struction sites activities. This category includes activities of
various types and scales: from the distribution area's yards to
sites pertaining to thermal plants or the construction of new
renewable hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal or biomass
plants. These activities are subject to significant variations over
the years in terms of environmental issues directly managed
by the Group. From 2016 onwards, reporting was developed
and based on a new model of the sustainable construction
site and on the principles of the circular economy which are
