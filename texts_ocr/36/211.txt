Counterparty analysis

By analysing counterparties, an assessment is made of potential reputational risks to the Company after entering into

and/or continuing business relations or collaborations with third parties (suppliers, business partners, etc.). In December

2016, the first edition of the operating instructions of counterparty analysis was completed, thereby promoting common

criteria to carry out activities and standardise the models used to acquire the requests and the deliver the assessment to

the other units. In 2017, all the major countries adopted the operating instructions, in some cases by issuing a local-level

document and entering into specific country-level contracts..

The Group’s corporate governance

system

The corporate governance system Enel SpA (“Enel”) and its
Group have adopted is essentially aimed at creating value
for shareholders over the long term, taking into account the
social importance of the Group's business operations and
the consequent need, in conducting such operations, to
adequately consider all the interests involved.

Following the significant growth in size at international level,
the Enel Group currently has 14 companies with shares
listed on the Argentine, Brazilian, Chilean, Italian, Peruvian,
Russian, Spanish and US stocks exchanges. In this regard,
it stands as a unique business on the global scene, which is
characterised by complex management due to the presence
of various types of minority shareholders, the need to carry
out intra-group transactions and a lack of a clear and uniform
legal framework for groups multinationals.

Since the Group's restructuring in 2014, it has had the
opportunity to strengthen the corporate governance and
ensure the dissemination of best practices in this area across
all Enel Group companies with shares listed on regulated
markets, in compliance with the management autonomy
of the various companies involved and their applicable local
regulations.

As such, Enel's Board of Directors approved in 2015 (and
integrated in 2019) several Recommendations aimed at
strengthening these companies’ corporate governance and
ensuring that all such companies comply with the relevant
local best practices on this subject.

The Enel Group's Corporate governance Recommendation
for listed companies relate to:

> the composition of the management body, which must

210

ensure the correct size, the representation of any
minority shareholders and adequate diversity in terms of
the experience and professional-managerial skills of its
members, including in terms of gender, age and tenure;
the requirements of the members of the management
body. In particular, when selecting candidates for the
position of Chief Executive Officer, it is necessary to
identify profiles with the appropriate leadership for
the role, assessed on the basis of his/her reputation,
of the results achieved in previously held executive
roles and on his/her recognition in key markets. On
the other hand, when selecting candidates for the role
of independent member, it is recommended that the
competent function call upon a head-hunting firm, which
will apply the criteria specified in the Recommendations,
in order to strengthen the effectiveness and impartiality
of the selection process;

Directors’ remuneration. For remuneration paid to Enel
Group's employees, it is required that employees waive
or credit back to the company with which they have
entered into an employment contract any compensation
due for their participation to the management body,
except where they are called upon to take up executive
roles. The remuneration of the members of the
management body who are not employees of the Enel
Group shall be established taking into account, the
assigned role and responsibilities , as well as additional
factors including the results of the benchmark analysis
of the relevant market conducted by a specialised
company, as well as Enel Group policies;
