Enel Cuore Onlus

(non-profit organisation)

Enel Cuore Onlus was founded in 2003 due to Enel’s de-
sire to express its commitment to social solidarity on a
more transparent manner. It supports initiatives promoted
by non profit organisations that address the wellbeing of
the individual and the family, in particular in the communi-
ties where Enel is present.
During 2019, the Group confirmed its orientation towards
multi-year projects with a large impact and dimension for
the community regarding specific current issues. Spac-
es for learning, growth, study and work were created for
children and youth, to help them become independent. As
regards the topic of educational inequality, projects were
promoted to offer young people living in socially-econom-
ically disadvantaged situations the same educational and
cultural opportunities as those who instead have all the
economic and social means that are necessary. Finally,
specific interventions were carried out in favour of children
in health structures, promoting their accommodation and
the assistance of patients and families through parental
support projects as well as through the donation of state-
of-the-art equipment. The main projects targeted towards
children, adolescents and the future generations are de-
scribed below:
> Base Camp for Future Education, an experimental,
two-year project that offers educational opportunities
to adolescents with economic difficulties in the periph-
eral areas of Rome, Naples and Palermo, through the
creation of three educational “Base Camp” centres,
that is learning environments where a team of careful-
ly selected and trained teachers, educators and psy-
chologists work to help teenagers between the ages
of 13 and 16, following them in their studies through
an empathetic and stimulating approach to help them
with their school education. There is also a calendar
of high-quality cultural and artistic events targeted to-
wards the students and the community in the territory
where the Base Camp is active, in order to provide fur-
ther simulation to people who would otherwise find it
difficult to access this type of offer;
> Fenix project, a rehabilitation process that promotes
the reinsertion of minors who committed crimes for

Community and shared value

which the judge ordered the suspension of the sen-
tence with so-called “probation”, an alternative meas-
ure to detention, which involves a process of self-as-
sessment and growth for the development of soft skills
and technical-professional training in a digital field, in
line with the current job market demand. The initia-
tives involved 20 teenagers who committed crimes in
Rome. At the end of the 250 hours of training, 10 of
the minors will start internships at a company and so-
cial-economic reintegration processes;

+> Miglior inizio (A better start), a pilot project devel-
oped on a national level to support infancy and new
parents during the most delicate phase of their child's
life. This project includes material (such as a contri-
bution towards food or daycare expenses) as well as
psych-social support actions, with the aim of strength-
ening the skills of parents during the perinatal period.
A social network has been created in support of the
project that, by integrating accredited bodies and ser-
vices, will make the initiative sustainable over time.
The project involves five large cities;

> Nuovo e Grande Buzzi (New and large Buzzi), a pro-
ject that involves the construction of a new 7-storey
pavilion connected to the Buzzi paediatric hospital in
Milan, dedicated to emergencies and high intensity
care. The new pavilion will house the emergency room,
the day hospital, operating rooms, the intensive and
sub-intensive paediatric care unit and neonatal patholo-
gy. Enel Cuore has decided to support the Buzzi Foun-
dation by donating a new 3 Tesla whole-body magnetic
resonance machine, contributing towards the creation
of Italy's first “x-ray free" paediatric hospital.
