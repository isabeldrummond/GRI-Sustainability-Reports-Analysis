Enel and sustainable finance Ee

Sustainability is an increasingly critical lever for the generation of economic and financial value. Enel has placed
three green bonds on the European market with a total value of 3.50 billion euros, respectively in January 2017 (1.25
billion), 2018 (1.25 billion) and 2019 (1 billion). The green bonds issued by Enel Finance International NV are destined
for institutional investors and guaranteed by Enel SpA. The issue of green bonds is aimed at financing projects that are
functional to the transition to the low carbon economy. For details, refer to the chapter “Green Bond Report”.

In September of 2019 Enel issued the world's first general purpose SDG-linked bond on the US market and on in-
ternational markets, for a total amount of 1.5 billion US dollars, linked to SDG 7 “Affordable and clean energy”. This
bond issue, which is the first of its kind and destined to satisfy the Company’s ordinary financial requirements, is linked
to the Group's ability to reach a percentage installed renewable capacity (on a consolidated basis) equal to or higher than
55% of the total consolidated installed capacity, by December 31, 2021. To assure and guarantee the transparency of
results, accomplishment of this goal will be subject to specific assurance by the appointed auditor. The interest rate ap-
plied will remain fixed until the debenture loan matures in relation to the achievement of the above indicated sustainable
objective at December 31, 2021: in the event of failure to accomplish this goal, a step-up mechanism will be applied
with an increase of 25 bps of the interest rate, starting from the first interest period following the date of publication
of the auditor's assurance report. After the success of said placement, Enel launched a new SDG-linked bond on the
European market for the total amount of 2.5 billion euros. |n addition to the objective linked to SDG 7 inserted in the
previous issue, a further target linked to SDG 13 “Climate action” was added (emissions of greenhouse gases equal to
or lower than 125. gCO,/kWh,, within 2030). On both occasions, Enel obtained an average economic benefit of around
15 bps with respect to a potential issue without sustainable characteristics. In addition, in October Enel SpA signed an
agreement with UniCredit SpA for the first revolving line of credit linked, as in the case of the above mentioned bond
issues, to SDG 7 for the value of 1 billion euros and duration of 5 years. In relation to accomplishment of the target with-
in the prescribed date, the line of credit provides a step-up/step-down mechanism that will affect the interest margin if
the line is used, or the commission, if the line is not used. Enel has planned to increase the recourse to sustainable
sources of borrowings from the 22% of 2019 to 43% in 2022 and to around 77% in 2030.

Enel was recognised by the International Financing Review (IFR) as the ESG Issuer of the year at the time of the 2019
IFR Awards, for its commitment to a sustainable strategy that has revolutionised the borrowing market. Moreover, the
Group's five-year SDG-linked bonds, valued at 1.5 billion US dollars, were elected Yankee Bond of 2019.

Since 2017, Enel is also a Member Issuer of Green Bond Principles (GBP) and Social Bond Principles (SBP) at the
International Capital Market Association (ICMA), and founding member of the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative
(CFLI), the aim of which is to facilitate the private cash flows necessary in the path of mitigation of and adaptation
to climate change, as provided for in the Paris Agreement. The Enel CEO is also the sole representative of an Italian
company and a global utility provider that adheres to the GISD Alliance, a group of 30 leaders committed to boosting
long-term investments for sustainable development and facilitating the alignment of commercial operations, finance
and investments with the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Enel also participates in the Corporate Forum on
Sustainable Finance, a network created to aid the development and growth of sustainable finance. Finally, Enel co-
chairs the CFO Taskforce for SDGs of the UN Global Compact, which has the long-term objective of defining principles
and a roadmap for sustainable business financing.
