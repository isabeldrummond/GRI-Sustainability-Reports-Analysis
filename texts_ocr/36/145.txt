Occupational
health and safety

Enel considers the people's health, safety and psychological and physical well-being

the most precious asset to be protected at all times of life, at work, at home and

during leisure time, and is committed to developing and disseminating a robust

safety culture throughout the entire perimeter of the Company in order to guaran-

tee a workplace that is free from health and safety hazards. Enel SpA people are

responsible for their own health and safety and for the health and safety of the

people with whom they interact and, as specified in Enel Group's “Stop Work Poli-

haviours. The constant commitment of all, integration of safety in processes and in

training activities, disclosure and analysis of near miss accidents, rigorous selection

and management of contractor companies, quality controls, sharing of experience

within the Group and benchmarking with the best international operators are the

foundational elements of Enel’s safety culture.

The commitment of top management to disseminating these elements is for

malised in the “Statement of Commitment to Health and Safety’ signed by the

Chief Executive Officer, which is based on the following key principles:

+> compliance with legislation, adoption of the best standards and sharing of ex-
perience;

+> creation, implementation and continual improvement of the Occupational
Health & Safety Management System in compliance with international stan-
dard ISO 45001;

> reduction of injuries, occupational diseases and other accidental events through
the implementation of suitable preventive measures and checking of their ade-
quacy and effectiveness;
assessment of all health and safety risks and adoption of a systematic approach
to eliminate them at source if possible, or to minimise them;

+> promotion of informative initiatives to disseminate and consolidate a culture of
good health, safety and organisational well-being;

> adoption of working methods inspired by quality and their dissemination by
means of incisive and effective training that aims to create a lasting connection
between technical aspects and safety aspects;

+> direct commitment of the persons in charge aimed at strengthening a robust
culture of leadership in relation to safety;

> adoption of safe and responsible conduct throughout all levels of the organisa-
