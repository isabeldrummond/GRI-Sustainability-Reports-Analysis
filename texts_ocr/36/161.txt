risk classes — it requires specific certificates/self-declara-

tions or on-site visits to verify fulfilment of the above require-

ments. The company’s compliance with the requirements

must be ensured for the duration of the qualification and, as

such, companies already included in Enel's Register of Qual-

ified Suppliers are constantly monitored for events that may

affect both the company itself and its main representatives,

including through the use of external databases.

The qualification system serves as:

> a guarantee for Enel, as it provides an updated list of
entities with proven reliability (in legal, financial, tech-
nical and organisational, ethical, health and safety, and
environmental aspects) which it can draw upon;

> an opportunity for suppliers to be called to participate in
the procurement procedures announced by the Group's
companies, in accordance with the relevant rules.

There are three main areas of analysis:

> Health and Safety: the “Safety Self-Assessment” allows
Enel to easily send to its suppliers the key requirements
to grow together, and in July 2018 it became an inte-
gral part of the sustainability requirements for assessing
MCs with a Health and Safety risk;

+> Environment: environmental assessment criteria vary
depending on the merchandise category and level of
tisk associated with each MC on a scale from 1 to 3.
For MCs considered to have a high environmental risk,
the ISO 14001 certification or equivalent is always re-
quired. Moreover, for these merchandise categories, an
on-site audit at the contractor's premises/sites is always
required. As part of the qualification process, Enel has
introduced a specific assessment of environmental re-
quirements, in addition to the usual checks, for suppliers
to be placed on the Supplier Register;

> Human Rights: taking a prudential approach, Enel as-
sesses suppliers in relation to human rights, regardless
of the level of risk, through a dedicated questionnaire
which analyses the characteristics of potential suppliers
in terms of inclusion and diversity, protection of work-
ers’ privacy, verification of their supply chain, forced or
child labour, freedom of association and collective bar-
gaining and fair working conditions (including fair wag-
es and hours worked). In 2019, the questionnaire was
integrated with further verification questions for a more
accurate assessment of the potential supplier.

Individual suppliers can only be placed on the Supplier Reg-

ister (or remain on it if previously qualified) and be invited

to participate in the Group's procurement procedures if it is

160

given an overall positive assessment. If, however, the result
is negative, the assessment request will be rejected and the
contractor may not be called to take part in Group tenders.
The evaluation of individual sustainability requirements con-
tributes to the overall assessment of the company’s suitabil-
ity to be placed on Enel's Supplier Register. In the event that
a supplier is deemed non-eligible for the Enel Register as a
result of a negative assessment on one or more sustainabil-
ity requirements, the supplier may make a new assessment
request at a later time.

In 2019, 100% of qualified suppliers were assessed accord-
ing to social, environmental and safety criteria. The number
of qualified suppliers with a contract still active at the end of
2019 is approximately 3,100 (around 28% of active suppliers
as of December 31), while the total number of active qual-
ified companies is approximately 8,200. The following table
shows the trend of qualified suppliers as a percentage for
the three aspects analysed by process.

 

2 Only contracts with a value of more than 25 thousand euros (so-called de-
legated purchases; excluding Sanpaolo, Edesur and part of Romania). The
total of new suppliers that did not have a contract in 2018 equalled 3,748
(4,668 in 2018 that did not have a contract in 2017), of which 27% were
qualified (17% in 2018)
