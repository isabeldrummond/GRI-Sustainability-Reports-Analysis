the publication of recommendations in 2020 that will serve
to support participants in the area of digital reporting. The
collaboration with GRI has also led Enel to provide its own
support with the translation work into Italian of the GRI Sus-
tainability Reporting Standard (GRI Standard), which was
launched on 30 September 2019. The dissemination of this
Standard has become ever more important in the context
of the 2030 Agenda — a large and complex system where
everyone is expected to contribute towards achieving the
objectives.
With this in mind, Enel and GRI have decided to further
strengthen their partnership through an innovative form
of collaboration, to be developed over a two-year period
(2019-2020). By pooling their respective skills, they have set
themselves the double objective of analysing whether and
how the United Nations 2030 Agenda and SDGs impact the
corporate reporting process and how businesses and gov-
ernments collaborate to make progress on the SDGs in the
various geographical, economic and socio-political contexts.
This analysis will improve and innovate the concept of “part-
nership” itself, in line with SDG 17 — a key element for accel-
erating and boosting the private sector's impact in achieving
the 2030 Agenda.
The first phase of the project — which ended in 2019 — took
the form of two reports following two online debates where
Enel and GRI engaged a multi-stakeholder audience to spark
a discussion, with the aim of:
+> delving into the role played up until now by reporting
and partnerships in driving change in the private sector
to achieve the SDGs;
+> gaining an overview of the actions to be taken to ensure
that the SDG reporting can stimulate the development
of new partnerships and new business models.
The second and final phase of the collaboration — which is to
be completed at the end of 2020 — is based on the results
of the two debates and aims to open up dialogue at region-
al-level focusing on strengthening the role of the SDGs.

Transparency International - In 2019, Enel renewed its
commitment to the Business Integrity Forum (BIF), promot-
ed by Transparency International Italia. This brings togeth-
er several large Italian companies interested in developing
common projects to enhance business integrity and dis-
seminate best practices to prevent and tackle corruption, as
well as for the benefit of other stakeholders, such as small
and medium-sized enterprises. Enel helped set up the BIF
Lab, an event organised in collaboration with the Scuola Su-
periore SantAnna in Pisa. Enel brought its experience with
“Anti-Bribery and Sustainability” and highlighted how the
commitment to anti-corruption — a key pillar of compliance
— is being increasingly integrated within sustainable devel-
opment policies.

In 2019, Enel's Chief Executive Officer, Francesco Starace,
accepted the invitation of United Nations Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres to join the Global Investors for Sustain-
able Development (GISD) Alliance — a biennial United Na-
tions initiative that aims to identify new ways of promoting
long-term investments for sustainable development. The
Alliance is an integral part of the United Nations Strategy
for Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
and is made up of 30 global business leaders working to-
gether to unlock the funding needed to achieve the SDGs
and kick-start social, economic and environmental improve-
ment across the world.

The Company has also continued to pursue its commitment
to Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), an international
non-profit organisation which collaborates with the private
sector, civil society, institutions and governments to support
the Sustainable Development Goal on energy (SDG 7). This
commitments comes under the Multi-stakeholder plat-
form on SDGs - the European Commission initiative with a
two-year term (2017-2019) which aims to support and guide
the Commission in achieving the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals at European level. Lastly, since 2016,
Enel has been a member of the International Integrated
Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Sustainable Business
Roundtable (SBRT).
