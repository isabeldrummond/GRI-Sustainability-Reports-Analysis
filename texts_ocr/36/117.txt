cess in order to identify the suitable actions to implement in

order to improve relationships with the local community. This

analysis was carried out also with the support of a company
with considerable experience in this topic, “Environmental

Resources Management” (ERM), and an action plan was pre-

pared based on the results. Community relations were man-

aged based on the criteria of accountability, transparency,

measurement and fairness of the solutions, in order to create

shared value over the long term. The main actions concerned:

> the identification of structural improvements needed for
the homes in the communities of Huertos Familiares and
Doria Isidora. In 2018, a technical committee was formed,
comprised of representatives of the Company, the com-
munity and the CITEC (Universidad del Bio Bio), which fo-
cused on identifying the repairs that were necessary for
the homes with construction defects. During 2019, the
technical problems were identified for all the houses and
the repair work was planned, to be started in 2020;

> the creation of a dashboard summarising the impacts on
the quality of life of the families due to the construction de-
fects in the homes in which the communities lived starting
from 2010, as well as the quantification and liquidation of
the relative compensation;

> the relocation of the churches that had not been involved
in the resettlement process. To date, 7 churches are being
built, and the first was opened at the beginning of 2020;

> the agreement for the reconstruction of the historical
school in Coronel, “Rosa Medel”, in another location, in-
cluding financing by Enel Generacién of soil study and the
cofinancing for the reconstruction of the school;

+ the development of the programme “Mi barrio, nuestro
barrio” (“My neighbourhood, our neighbourhood") which
includes the implementation of requalification projects for
new and pre-existing neighbourhoods in the area of plant
influence. During 2019, construction was completed for a
sports centre in the community of Huertos Familiares as
well as eco-construction works of the site in the Cerro Ob-
ligado neighbourhood and a recreational area with green
spaces and eco-sustainable infrastructures;

> the development of a transparent and fair system for
managing community claims and/or requests. This
system made it possible to successfully resolve more
than 100 cases, thanks to a multifunctional team that
includes legal experts as well as resettlement and sus-
tainability consultants, and that guarantees the verifiabil-
ity, transparency and fairness of the solutions.

During 2019, innovative initiatives were implemented for

N16

local economic development, the recovery of public spac-

es and the development of the human capital of Coronel,

including:

+> circular economy projects: in the community of Cerro
Obligado a training project was started previously for
women in eco-construction and eco-furnishing. The pro-
ject was implemented in collaboration with the Sembra
NGO, and as of today has trained four women. Today
the so-called ecological carpenters work in their labora-
tory in Coronel, where they reuse pallets and other ma-
terials from various local industries, transforming them
into furniture and other types of objects. The workshop
also has electrical means of transport to deliver their
products. As of today, this company has recycled more
than 1,000 pallets coming from local industry and has
made more than 700 pieces of furniture;

+> participatory art for the recovery of public spaces: by
means of a community participatory process, Chile's
longest mural was created in Coronel, located outside
the perimeter wall of the Bocamina power plant. The
project involved more than 70 people, from children of
the age of 7 up to 80 year old grandparents;

+> Coronel cleaning plan: the plan involves the elimination
of the micro-waste landfills and the removal of residual
materials from the homes where the transferred fam-
ilies lived previously, avoiding environmental impacts
and situations of abandonment and insecurity;

> Casa Abierta Coronel: a place of reference for the en-
tire community, in line with Enel’s Open Power vision,
where it is possible to speak openly with the Company,
receive information, communicate any complaints and
evaluate solutions with a group of available experts.
The criteria at the basis are transparency, fairness and
non-discrimination.

In 2019, Enel Chile signed an agreement with the country’s

government for the gradual decommissioning of the three

coaltfired electric power plants. The first, Tarapacd, was

closed in December 2019, whereas the Bocamina 1 and 2

power plants are to be closed respectively in 2023 and 2040.
