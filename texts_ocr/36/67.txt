1 The methodology and sources considered for calculating greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, 2, 3) are detailed in the following paragraph. The values for 2018
and 2017 were modified by adding the new calculation categories introduced in 2019. The Scope 2 emissions for electricity purchased from the grid were
recalculated due to the expansion of the calculation basis. Regarding the year-over-year data comparison and the relative sums, the figures shown in the table
regarding year-over-year data comparison and subset additions are calculated considering decimal digits that may not be disclosed in the table.

2 For all combustion processes from fossil sources, the production of N,O (GWP = 265) and CH, (GWP = 28) expressed in CO, equivalent are included. These
values, not present in the 2017 and 2018 reporting, were recalculated for the previous two years. The calculation of the other activities also includes CO, equi-
valent emissions from the combustion of diesel fuel in the generating sets, from the fuel of the company fleet, from the fuel used in the offices for heating and
canteens, fluorinated gases and ODS, SF, and NF,

3 The values do not include the emissions from technical losses of the Enel distribution grid, which were calculated only as location based,

4 Avoided emissions are calculated as the sum of the emissions avoided in the different countries where Enel is present. The resulting value is the product of
the generation of electricity obtained from a renewable or nuclear sources and the specific CO, emissions from the thermoelectric generation of the country in

which Enel is present.

The GHG inventory statements were audited by DNV GL,
one of the main certification entities world-wide, with a rea-
sonable level of certainty for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope
3 emissions, as limited to the sale of natural gas, and with
a limited level of certainty for the other Scope 3 emissions
included within the scope of application of the inventory.
The audit was conducted according to Standard ISO 4064-
3 for the compliance of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories
with the WBCSD/WRI Corporate Accounting and Reporting
Standard (GHG Protocol).

Scope 1 emissions

In 2019, the direct CO, emissions (Scope 1) were equal to
approximately 70 mil t, with a 27% decrease as compared
to 2018 mainly due to reduced thermal generation and in
particular a reduction in the coal component (-42% as com-
pared to 2018). The considerable share of these emissions
originates from the energy production in thermal pow-
er plants fuelled by coal, oil & gas and combined cycles.
The percentage of emissions related to EU ETS is equal to
49.5% of the total Scope 1. Scope 1 also includes the CO,
emissions generated during the petrol and diesel combus-
tion process in the engines of machines controlled by the
