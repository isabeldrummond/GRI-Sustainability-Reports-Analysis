able business model by putting the fight against climate
change at the centre of its strategy.

The Global Business Lines are responsible for the devel-
opment of activities related to promoting renewable gener-
ation, the optimisation of heat capacity, the digitalization of
the electricity grid and the development of business solu-
tions that enable energy transition and the fight against cli-
mate change. In 2019, Enel Green Power and Global Ther-
mal Generation merged, creating Global Power Generation,
which confirms the guiding role of the Enel Group in energy
transition, by means of an integrated process of decarboniza-
tion and the sustainable development of renewable capacity.
The Global Service Functions are responsible for adopting
sustainable criteria, including climate change, in supply chain
management and developing digital solutions that develop
the development of technologies enabling energy transition
and the fight against climate change.

Ona local level, the Regions and Countries have the task of
promoting decarbonization and guiding the energy transition
towards a low carbon business model, within their areas of
responsibility. Furthermore, the Europe and Euro-Mediterra-
nean Affairs Function is responsible for defining the Group's
position on climate change, low carbon policies and the regu-
lation of the international carbon market on a European level.
Additionally, the Group Investments Committee, chaired
by the Chief Executive Officer, grants approval for the ex-
penses for investments related to business development.
This committee also has the task of guaranteeing that all
investments are fully in line with the Group’s commitment
to promoting a low carbon business model and reaching de-
carbonization by 2050.

Commitment to the fight against climate change

 

Incentives system
concerning climate change

The Company's remuneration policy includes different

mechanisms for the purpose of progressing towards energy

transition, in particular:

> a variable short-term remuneration (MBO) that can in-
clude objectives relative to the specific company func-
tion of each manager. For example, they can include
objectives related to the development of renewable en-
ergies for the manager in the Global Power Generation
Business Line or related to energy transition solutions in
the Enel X Global Business Line. Furthermore, the new
MBO system assigned to the CEO for 2020 envisions
the addition of a new quantitative climate objective con-
nected to the growth of the renewable net installed ca-
pacity in comparison to the total net installed capacity,
which represents the 15% short-term variable retribu-
tion;

> a long-term variable remuneration that, starting in 2018,
includes a quantitative climate objective, that is, the re-
duction of Enel Group CO, emissions per kWh, over the
next three years, which represents 10% of total long-
term variable retribution;
