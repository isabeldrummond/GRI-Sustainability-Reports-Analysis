Report on corporate governance

There is a clear link between sustain-
ability and value creation given that,
investing in sustainable projects from
the environmental and social point of
view, companies can maximise profits
and minimise risks while simultaneous-
ly contributing to the achievement of
the SDGs. Socially responsible inves-
tors continue to grow in 2019, holding
10.8% of total shares (10.5% in 2018),
equivalent to 14.1% of floating capital
(13.7% in 2018). Moreover, the Enel in-
vestors who have signed the UN Prin-
ciples for Responsible Investment (UN
PRI) hold 43% of total shares.

ESG analysts and international rating
agencies monitor Enel's sustainability
performance constantly. Through the
application of different methodologies,
analysts assess Group performance

ESG ratings are therefore deemed to be
a strategic tool to support investors and
identify risks and opportunities linked
to the sustainability in their investment
portfolio, aiding the development of ac-
tive and passive sustainable investment
strategies.

ability indices, with several important
