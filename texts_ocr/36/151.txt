Emergencies management

 

 

Enel has a common crisis and critical events management
system across the various countries in which the Group is
present. This global management system involves evaluation
of the impact caused by critical events by means of a stan-
dard reference scale with three levels. High-impact crises
are managed centrally, while medium- or low-impact crisis
situations are managed within the specific organisation in
the individual countries.

High-impact crises (“Group Red Code”) are addressed by
creating a central crisis committee in the Security Control
Room at the Viale Regina Margherita headquarters in Rome,
supplying support 24/7 for communication and coordination
of information flows.

Moreover, the crisis committee defines strategies and ac-
tions to deal with critical events and coordinates all actions
designed to restrict damage to the Enel Group's property,
profitability and reputation.

Enel SpA has a Security unit in the Holding's People and Or
ganization Function, aimed at defining strategies and guide-
lines on matters of security, reporting to top management

Nuclear policy

In the context of its operations in the field of nuclear tech-
nologies, Enel has made a public commitment, in the role of
shareholder, to guarantee that a clear nuclear safety policy
is adopted in its atomic energy plants and that the plants
are managed in accordance with criteria capable of assuring
the absolute priority of safety and protection of workers, the
community and the environment. Further details are avail-
able on the Enel website (https:/Avww.enel.com/investors/

and promoting sharing of best practices. Also, a travel safety
process has been set up in order to protect Enel people trav-
elling in different countries, supplying information and com-
munications on destination countries, indicating conditions
that can constitute health and safety risks of travellers (e.g.
political turmoil, terror attacks, crime, health threats, etc.),
the guidelines and conduct to follow, and activation of the
necessary safety measures with regard to the level of risk
identified for the destination country.

Further to the new Coronavirus epidemic (Covid-19) in Chi-
na towards the end of January and the subsequent spread
of contagion in other parts of the world, Enel promptly im-
plemented a raft of different actions in all the Group's geo-
graphical areas in order to minimise the risk of contagion and
guarantee electricity supplies at the same time. The Com-
pany also set up a Global Task Force and specific Local Task
Forces, constituted by the Health, Safety, Environment and
Quality, Security and Real Time Communications units. In all
the countries, the Local Task Force coordinates the pertinent
activities and establishes the necessary actions.
