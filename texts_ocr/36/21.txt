The adoption of a sustainable and inte-
grated business model in 2015 has al-
lowed Enel to pick up on opportunities
in the energy sector linked to global de-
carbonization and electrification trends,
and to take its place alongside the lead-
ers in the energy transition. Thanks to
this approach, Enel today is a more
sustainable, efficient, and remunerative
company, with a significantly lower risk
profile and greater capacity to adapt rap-
idly to change.

The 2020-2022 strategy focuses on
the achievement of the UN Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) throughout
the entire value chain, placing SDG 13
(Action to combat climate change) at
the centre. Decarbonization of the en-
ergy mix, by accelerating the growth of
renewable capacity (SDG 7 - Afforda-
ble and clean energy), and the gradual
closure of coal plants, combined with
electrification of consumption, will be
the pillars for the next three-year peri-
od. The enabling factors are infrastruc-
ture and networks, in line with SDG 9
(Industry, innovation and infrastructure),
and also ecosystems and platforms, in
line with SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and
communities).

From the operational standpoint, a 14.1
GW increase in renewable capacity is
planned within 2022, reaching around
60 GW of total managed capacity,
mainly due to organic growth, with a
reduction in global coal generation

of around 74% compared to 2018. At
the same time, the proportion of re-
newables versus total capacity should
reach 60% in three years, guiding the
increase in profitability of generation as-
sets and increasing zero CO, emission
generation to 68% by 2022. In the drive
to achieve complete decarbonization
by 2050, Enel has created a roadmap
with interim objectives, certified by the
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi),
with a projected reduction of 70% in
direct greenhouse gas emissions per
kWh in 2030 with respect to 2017
levels, unto reaching 125 g/kWh,,'. A
commitment was also made to reduce
Enel’s indirect emissions associated
with the sale of natural gas on the retail
market by 16% within 2030 compared
to the 2017 values.

The Plan calls for specific investments
dedicated to the electrification of con-
sumption, promoting growth of the
customer base, and constant increases
in efficiency supported by the creation
of global business platforms.

In consideration of the important role
of smart infrastructure in a world of
completely decarbonized energy, the
Plan aims to make the network ever
more flexible and resilient, by means
of investments in digitalization, service
quality, and efficiency. The 2022 key ob-
jectives include a projected 9% reduc-
tion in the System Average Interruption
Frequency Index (SAIFI) and around 29

The energy transition will be supported
also by the development of new servic-
es, including an increase in the demand
response (10.1 GW in 2022), installa-
tion of 736 thousand public and pri-
vate charging points for electric ve-
hicles within the reference three-year
period, and the development of other
electrification services.

In the period 2020-2022, Enel will also
continue to adopt a platform-based
model primarily in networks, in retail
and in Enel X. In networks the use of a
global platform allows the standardisa-
tion of management and maintenance,
of customer administration processes,
and of resources and systems allo-
cation. Enel is engaged in the retail in
the construction and management of a
model based on products and services
rather than on local markets, to aid inno-
vation and efficiency in all countries and
regions. Enel X adopts the “by design”
platform model and develops innovative
products and services, also by way of
its partners.

The people cen , a sustainable
supply chain, sound governance, oc-
cupational health and safety and a
focus on the environment strengthen
and complete the Group's sustainability
strategy, thus contributing to the ac-
complishment of all 17 of the sustaina-
ble development goals.

A high level of attention is devoted to
the people working in the Company,
deemed to be key factors of the strate-
