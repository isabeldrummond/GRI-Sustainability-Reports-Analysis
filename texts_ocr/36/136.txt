Innovation and digitalization

Compared to last year in which the measures intended for
the video communication service were related exclusively to
the use of the “Blue Jeans” cloud platform, in 2019, through
the completion of the “Unified Communication & Collabo-
ration” project, the Global Digital Solutions unit has intro-
duced a new digital platform that has made it possible to
enhance, integrate and extend digital services and tools. In
2019, these actions therefore allowed the greater diffusion
of the use of video communication solutions, contributing
to the increase in savings on travel and transfers and to the
reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.

A printing service has been operating in all Enel offices for some
time now. In addition to using new-generation printers, designed
for more environmentally friendly use, the service was con-
ceived on an advanced business model that has allowed Enel
to evolve from the concept of product to that of service. The
unique aspects of this service, together with a more rational use
of printed documents and digitalization, have led to a reduction
in paper consumption over the years and consequently a lower
impact on the environment. In particular, based on the number
of printed pages and the printers’ technical specifications, the
quantity of CO, associated with the electricity consumption of
printers while printing is calculated by applying each country's
emission coefficient (data source: Enerdata), which takes into
account the specific mix of energy sources present’.

countries: Italy, Spain, Russia, Romania, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia.
