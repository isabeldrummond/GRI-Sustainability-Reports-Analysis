exception to the line-by-line consolidation scope are the com-
panies acquired in 2019, for which, on the basis of prevailing
practice, as also represented in the Consob report of January
19, 2018%, it was decided to begin consolidation, with regard to
some of the areas covered in this document, with effect from
2020, in the light of the reduced acquisition period. The areas of

gradually be transferred to the purchaser. The Capex contracts have been ta-
