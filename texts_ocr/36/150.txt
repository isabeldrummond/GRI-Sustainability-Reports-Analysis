Specific actions have been carried out in the framework of
the project, including the “SHE 2.019 leadership program’
which led to the selection and training of a community of
safety influencers to facilitate the dissemination of safety
values throughout all organisational areas, and “Inspector
2.0" aimed at developing the technical and relational skills of
inspectors and supervisors in the field, to strengthen coach-
ing actions towards internal people and companies that work
with Enel.

Communications on the global level in relation to health and
safety were focused on topics concerning personal health
and the most common pathologies.

Safety of communities and third parties

Enel's installed plants are built in compliance with legislative
prescriptions and the rules of best technical practice. Plants,
machines and work equipment are subject to systematic
and periodic checks and maintenance activities to guarantee
correct operation in compliance with regulations and in ac-
cordance with the adoption of the best standards.

In order to guarantee health and safety of the community
and reduce the impact of the typical activities of the com-
pany’s generation process on the external environment, the
Company carries out monitoring campaigns such as mea-
surement of the electromagnetic fields of power networks,
noise levels, vibration and dust created by the electrical
machines of power plants and distribution and transformer
substations. Also the following environmentally significant
factors are monitored: atmospheric emissions and air quali-
ty, effluent discharge into surface waters, water quality, pro-
duction, reuse and disposal of wastes, soil quality, biodiver
sity impacts.

Considerable attention has been devoted to preventing
harmful events involving members of the public who acci-
dentally come into contact with electricity networks due to
activities such as job sites near transmission lines or sports
and leisure pursuits (fishing, flying kites, etc.). A large num-
ber of awareness campaigns have been conducted, ad-
dressed both to the general public and to specific categories
(construction companies, sports associations, etc.).
