Reporting criteria

In order to facilitate transparency and facilitate understand-
ing of reporting over the years, the report is structured as
follows:
+> summary table of 2017, 2018 and 2019 emissions
with indication of the installed capacity and of the CO,
avoided;
> 2017 green bond reporting with evidence of projects
relating to renewable plants. Seven plants also contri-
bute towards the allocation of the proceeds of the 2019
green bond following new investments (Capex) that
were made;
> 2018 green bond reporting with evidence of projects
related to:
> renewable plants, three of which that contribute
towards the allocation of the proceeds of the 2019
green bond due to new investments (Capex) that
were made;

> “refinancing” of renewable plants due to the repla-
cement of previous credit lines;

> investment activities relating to the business area
“Infrastructure and Networks”;

> 2019 green bond reporting with evidence of the
projects relating to renewable plants, 10 of which were
also subject to reporting for the 2017 and 2018 green
bonds as described above.

The indicators were determined in accordance with the

“Green Bond Framework” principles and shown in the table

based on the type of project and the year of emission of the

green bonds.

Table A “Financial indicators” shows

> the capacity and amount of the “foreign currency in-
vestment” approved by the Board of Directors and/or
the Investment Committee, and communicated to the
financial market through specific press releases;

+ the value of the “investment in euros", calculated by
considering the average exchange rate for the years
2017-2019 (for projects defined in 2017), the average
exchange rate for the years 2018-2020 (for projects de-
fined in 2018) and/or the average exchange rate for the
years 2019-2021 (for projects defined in 2018) of Enel's
Industrial Plan;

> the share of the green bond proceeds allocated to the

Green Bond Report

project as the difference between the total capitalized
costs as at December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018
and/or December 31, 2019 and the amount of third-party
financing associated to the specific project”. The amoun-
ts of proceeds allocated to the projects in 2017, 2018
and 2019 respectively were used in the same years;

> the date of entry into operation corresponding to the
time when the plant produced the first kWh.

Table B “ESG indicators” shows the environmental benefit

in terms of CO, avoided (actual or expected). In particular

with reference to:

renewable projects:

+> the quantity of CO, avoided (both actual and expected)
is determined by multiplying production (actual or
expected) by the emission factor linked to the specific
thermoelectric energy production of the country in whi-
ch the plant is located (emission factors source: Enerda-
ta- February 25, 2020 release);

> the share of production (both actual and expected) and
the related amount of CO, avoided attributable to the gre-
en bond, calculated as the share of green bond proceeds
allocated to the project on the total investment (applicable
only to projects for which there is a new Capex for 2019);

+ for projects relating to generation plants from renewable
sources, the cumulative value of actual production and
the relative CO, avoided for all years of reporting of the
green bond report is also shown (with the exception of
the repowering plants whose share of production can-
not be separated from the rest of the plant);

Infrastructure and Networks projects (among others):

+> the cabling ratio, determined by the ratio between the
length of the cable lines and the total length of the lines.
The increase in this index over time is due to an increase
in the length of the overhead and underground cable line
to the detriment of bare conductors; in particular, the
main environmental benefits concern the containment
of plant cutting activities and a drastic reduction in the
risk of electrocution for birds;

2. Ifthe same companys involved with the implementation of several projects,
proceeds are allocated to the specific project based on the capacity.
