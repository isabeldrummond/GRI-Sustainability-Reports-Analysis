tors potentially influenced by the transition scenario, with
particular regard to the price of CO, (ETS). Examining the
main transition variables, the price of CO, appears to be
an especially reliable driver of regulatory measures that
could accelerate the transition process.
To assess the impact of possible changes in this driver,
the effects of a potential change of +/-10% in the CO,
price for Italy and Spain are determined. This price change
would modify the equilibrium price of both wholesale mar-
kets, with repercussions on the margins of Global Power
Generation for both thermal and renewable plants.
To quantify the risks and opportunities engendered by the
energy transition in the medium term, two scenarios have
been considered for Italy and Spain:
> “Current policies” scenario: based on the current
energy transition policies of Italy and Spain (PNIEC),
which are presumably consistent with an intermedi-

bite

 

ate climate scenario between RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6.
The “current policies” scenario considered for the
two countries, while among the less ambitious sce-
narios of RCP 2.6, represents a plausible outlook in
that it derives from policies that have already been
approved and which will probably not be disregarded.
Ata global level, however, if the world’s leading coun-
tries do not adopt effective decarbonization policies,
instead pursuing policies that produce no change or
actually worsen conditions, the “current policies” ap-
proach could still lead to a climate scenario in line with
RCP 8.5;

 

> “Accelerated policies” scenario: based on poten-

tially rapid transition policies aimed at achieving CO,
reduction targets that are presumably consistent with
the RCP 2.6 scenario. This scenario also incorporates
an increase in energy efficiency and a drive to electri-
