The Group will work to estimate the relationships between

changes in physical variables and the change in the poten-

tial output of individual plants in the different categories of

electricity generation technology.

Scenario analysis has shown that chronic structural chang-

es in the trends of physical variables will begin to occur af-

ter 2030. However, in order to obtain an indicative estimate

of the potential impacts, it is possible to test sensitivity of

the Business Plan to the factors potentially influenced by

the physical scenario, regardless of any direct relationship

with climate variables. Of course, such stress testing has

an extremely low probability of occurrence based on histor-

ical events and geographical diversification. The variables

examined are:

> electricity demand (+/-1% per year), whose variations
can potentially impact the generation and retail busi-
nesses. It was stress tested for all countries in which
the Group operates;

+> the output potential of renewables plants was also
stressed (+/-10% over a single year). Variations in this
variable can potentially impact the generation busi-
ness. It at the individual technology level around the

globe.
The data reported show the effect on a single year for a
single generation technology and include both the volume
and price effects.
