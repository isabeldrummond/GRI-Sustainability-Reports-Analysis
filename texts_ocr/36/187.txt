POLICY ON BIODIVERSITY

Enel’s policy on biodiversity has been developed to
contribute to the objectives of the United Nations
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the
Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 201 1-2020 and the
associated Aichi targets.

In particular, our company is committed to:

>» planning activities which can impact species
and natural habitats respecting the principle of
the “mitigation hierarchy’, whereby priority is
given, first, to avoid or prevent negative
impacts; second, where impacts cannot be
avoided, to minimize damage and
rehabilitating their effects; and, lastly, to
compensate (or offsetting) for residual adverse
impacts;

>> in case of unavoidable impacts, taking measures
to compensate the residual impact to achieve “no
net loss” of biodiversity and, where applicable, a
positive net balance;

>» performing, for every new installation, impact
studies that include a systematic assessment of
the effects on biotypes, animal and vegetal
species with the aim of avoiding operating in
areas with the highest biodiversity values and
adopting the best solutions to decrease the
pressures on biodiversity elsewhere;

>» cooperating with local communities, academia or
NGOs to identify the values of biodiversity and to
develop projects for the ecosystem safeguard and
restoration;

>» monitoring the effectiveness of implemented
measures;

> reporting regularly on its performance related to
biodiversity.

 

Biodiversity (SDG 14 and SDG 15) is one of the strategic tar
gets of the environmental policy andis regulated by a specif-
ic policy which Enel adopted in 2015 defining the guidelines
for all the Group's biodiversity protection initiatives for gen-
erating, transmitting and distributing electrical energy.

Enel has a consolidated experience in the management of
biodiversity in the areas around its sites. Activities for biodi-
versity conservation follow the development of the power
station facilities and in recent years have focussed on the re-
newable segment and on the networks across an increasing
number of countries. Vast scale monitoring continues in the
power plants and across the Group's long established instal-
lations in the territory, to prevent the impacts on coastal and
river environments. In relation to location management, and
in particular in relation to renewable-energy power plants,
the potential exposure to a biodiversity risk is highlighted
during the feasibility phase analysis of new power plants,
taking into account the geographic closeness of the sites
to protected areas, to important biodiversity zones, and the
potential presence of endangered species. This evaluation is
part of a more extensive analysis for the application of the
“Creating Shared Value” module through which the Com-
pany engages with the socio-economic and environmental

186

requirements of the territory, defining the project to create
long-term values for itself and for the local communities.

Knowledge of the location and its specific qualities entails
the involvement of local professionals in the activities in the
field, carrying out certain work relating to the protection of
the biodiversity of the site pre-operation (baseline), such as
flora and forest inventories, a census of the animal species in
the area impacted by the power plant, especially for species
which need to be partly retrieved and relocated. Then follow
the authorisation phases, realised in accordance with local
regulations, where various alternatives are assessed and
the most suitable actions decided to minimise the impact
of the power plant on the relevant habitats and species. The
implementation of authorised provisions and the proposed
mitigations similarly require the involvement of external
professionals during the plant building phase. Once opera-
tional, the protection of the biodiversity becomes an integral
part of the environmental management plans. During this
phase, there are regular inspections to control the impacts
highlighted during the authorisation phase. This is also the
moment where the plant consolidates its relationship with
the territory and where initiatives are developed, such as
voluntary projects, to safeguard local species based on the

Sustainability Report 2019
