tions on corporate responsibility (the “Compliance Pro-
gram”) in the various countries where the Group operates
(for example, Organisational Model 231 for Italian compa-
nies, the “Risk Prevention Model/Integrity Program” for
Group companies in Spain and South America);
> the Enel Global Compliance Program ("EGCP"), a govern-
ance tool aimed at strengthening the Group’s ethical
and professional commitment to preventing offences
committed outside of Italy that might result in corporate
criminal responsibility and risks to reputation. The EGCP.
applies to the Group's non-Italian companies and sup-
plements any compliance programmes adopted by the
same companies, in compliance with local regulations.
Without prejudice to the provisions of these compliance pro-
grammes and the specific regulatory provisions applicable
to the crime of corruption in all its forms, the Enel Global
Compliance Program complies with the main relevant legis-
lation and best corporate governance practices, constituting
the general conduct framework for Enel people in the fight
against corruption
The areas with the most potential exposure to corruption (ac-
tive and/or passive), both in relations with public administra-
tions and in the private sector, include: (i) the negotiation and
execution of contracts with third parties (public authorities,
associations, companies, etc.); (ii) participation in tenders
(public and private); (iii) selection of partners/consultants; (iv)
management of financial resources; (v) management of gifts
and hospitality; (vi) personnel recruitment processes; (vii) in-
centive mechanisms in top managers’ compensation.
In relation to these risk areas, the above governance tools
(ZTC Plan, Code of Ethics and the EGCP/Compliance Pro-
gram) — together with the current body of procedures — set
out an effective prevention system, which is an integral part
of the Group's Internal Control System. From an organisa-
tional perspective, the Chief Executive Officer, in exercising
his/her powers, represents Enel SpAs Governing Body pur-
suant to the standard ISO 37001; Top Management, on the
other hand, is represented by the Head of the Company's
Audit Function and Head of the Legal & Corporate Affairs
Function — both of whom report directly to the Chief Exec-
utive Officer.
Top Management, in performing its duties, makes use of all
necessary resources and the collaboration of the other re-
sponsible Departments heads, who also report directly to
the Chief Executive Officer (for example, People & Organisa-
tion, Communications).
On May 8, 2017, Enel SpAs ABMS was certified as conform-

226

 

ing to the international standard SO 37001:2016 on anti-brib-
ery management systems. The certification was confirmed
in successive maintenance checks in the course of 2018
and 2019 respectively. The certification is scheduled to be
renewed in 2020

After Enel SpA obtained certification ISO 37001 for its an-
tibribery management system, it gradually extended the
ISO 37001 certification plan to the Group's main Italian and
foreign subsidiaries. At present, the certification progress
has been successfully completed, specifically for Enel Green
Power SpA (also covering some of its foreign subsidiaries),
Enel Global Trading SpA, Enel Produzione SpA, E-Distribuzi-
one SpA, Enel Italia Srl, Enel Sole Srl, Enel.si Srl, Enel Ener
gia SpA, Servizio Elettrico Nazionale SpA, Enel X Srl, Enel X
Italia SpA, Enel Global Infrastructure & Networks Srl, and for
the Group's foreign companies, for Endesa SA, Enel Améri-
cas SA, Enel Generacién Chile SA, Enel Chile SA, Edesur SA,
Codensa SA, Emgesa SA, Enel Distribucion Perd SA, Enel
Generacion Peru SA, the companies operating in Romania.
During the 2020-2021 two-year period, the anti-bribery cer
tification process in accordance with ISO 37001 is due to be
further extended to other Italian and foreign companies of
the Group, in light of the current corporate scope during the
period in question.

The role of Enel SpAs “Anti-bribery compliance function” —
set up pursuant to the ISO 37001:2016 standard — has been
entrusted to an internal corporate body, made up of a repre-
sentative from the following Functions: Legal & Corporate
Affairs, Audit, People & Organization (Quality unit). The body
is tasked — among other things — with overseeing the Com-
pany’s planning and implementation of its anti-bribery man-
agement system.
