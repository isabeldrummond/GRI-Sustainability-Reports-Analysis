sions, the efficiency of the energy system, the decar-
bonization of the electricity sector, the reduction of
oil consumption, etc. For Italy and Spain, reference is
made to those countries’ integrated National Energy
and Climate Plans (NECPs), which are also approved at
the European level, while outside Europe, reference is
made to the respective national energy programs of the
countries involved.
In order to define the transition scenario for the electricity
sector, the Group considers the elements described above
(physical scenarios, assumptions about the macro and en-
ergy context, regulatory developments) as prerequisites for
the assessment of future projections of electricity demand,
electricity generation, renewables, etc.
In this context, the effect of temperature on electricity de-
mand in the long term (2030-2050) has been estimated. Ital-
ian electricity demand is provisionally forecast to increase
on average by up to 5%, due to the combined effect of the
chronic increase in temperature and the transition of the sys-
tem towards greater electrification of energy consumption.
Moreover, in the RCP 8.5 physical scenario the probability of
extremely hot years increases, leading to a future increase
of up to 10% in electricity demand, together with the risks
associated with more frequent extreme weather events.
In the case of Spain, however, over the same time horizon
the chronic effects would involve an average increase in de-
mand of around 2% and, in the possible peak year of the
RCP 8.5 scenario, it could reach +4%. The smaller increase

in electricity demand in the Spain compared with Italy mainly
reflects to the narrower scope for the future electrification
of consumption, as it is currently already largely electrified
as a consequence of the presence of nuclear power in the
country. These effects only reflect the long-term impact of
temperature on electricity demand and the inertial evolution
of the national energy system. They do not consider the re-
percussions of climate change on economies underscored
in the IPCC’s special report on global warming, which could
also have indirect effects on economies and, therefore, on
electricity demand.

The strategy to tackle

climate change

[103-2 ] [408-3

The strategy of the Enel Group has proven its ability to cre-
ate sustainable long-term value, integrating the themes of

 

   

sustainability and close attention to climate change issues.
The Group is among the leaders guiding the energy transi-
tion through the decarbonization of electricity generation
and the electrification of energy consumption, which rep-
resent opportunities both to increase value creation and
to contribute positively to more rapid achievement of the
Sustainable Development Goals set by the United National
(SDGs) in the 2030 Agenda, placing SDG 13 for the fight

Commitment to the fight against climate change

against climate change at the centre of its strategy.

As a result, the 2020-2022 Strategic Plan is based on a re-
newed set of “purpose driven” strategic pillars that repre-
sent the main industry trends connected to energy transi-
tion and the fight against climate change, also identifying
the main transformation enablers. The trends in decarbon-
ization and electrification, which are naturally connected
with the generation and sale of electricity, will be enabled
by the development of increasingly digital grids and the
evolution towards a platform-based business model.
