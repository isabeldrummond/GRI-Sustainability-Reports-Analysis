Health

 

The Enel Group has defined a structured health management
system based on preventive measures, to develop a corpo-
rate culture oriented towards the promotion of mental-physi-
cal health, organisational well-being and balance between the
professional and personal spheres. In this context, the Group
carries out global and local awareness raising campaigns to
promote healthy lifestyles, sponsors screening programmes
aimed at preventing the onset of illnesses and guarantees
the availability of medical services. In particular, a policy is
provided for the prevention of local diseases and for support
in the event of diseases and accidents in other countries; in
addition, a smartphone app has been introduced with travel
information, vaccination guidelines, and a new global insur
ance policy has been taken out to cover all workers who travel
internationally. In relation to the injuries phenomenon, apart
from implementing plans designed to reduce the frequency
‘to zero, it is planned to adopt a psychological support pro-
gramme for employees who have suffered serious injuries,
together with their families, in order to assist them from the
time of the event up to the return to normality.

Constant monitoring of epidemiological and health trends is
carried out within the perimeter of the Enel Group, with the
aim of implementing plans composed of preventive meas-
ures and measures to protect the health of employees and
anyone working for the Group, on both the local and global
levels.

Moreover, the Enel Group implements a systematic and
continuous process for identifying and evaluating correlated
work stress risks, in compliance with the “Stress at Work
Prevention and Well-being at Work Promotion” Policy. This
allows prevention, identification and management of stress
in work situations that can affect individuals and more ex-
tensive areas of the organisation, supplying also a series of
indications aimed at promoting a culture of organisational
well-being.

Finally, the Group provides its people with specific conven-
tions that provide ready access to: medical and healthcare
services, assistance actions for persons with disabilities or
in emergency situations, and specific preventive medicine
initiatives.

Development of safety culture:
training and information

 

Several health and safety communication campaigns were
carried out in the year concerning areas of specific attention
for the Company, based both on the publication of informa-
tion on the company intranet, and on specific services on
Enel TV and Enel Radio. Enel people received approximately
692 thousand training hours overall in 2019, in addition to in-
formation and training activities on safety, with the purpose
of increasing the know-how and specific skills of workers
throughout the Group.

On the global level, the Company proceeded with its com-
mitment to the SHE 365 project, launched in 2018, which
involved both Group people and vendors in initiatives con-

148

cerning Safety, Health and the Environment. In 2019 this

commitment was reinforced with SHE 2.019, which places

the topic of “Leadership on safety” at the centre and is de-

veloped in three main directions:

> the Commitment chain, to channel actions with the aim
of preventing fatalities and serious accidents, with par
ticular attention paid to life-changing injuries;

+> Inter BLs integration, that transforms the efforts of the
Countries and Regions into common factors of preven-
tive actions, increasing the synergy of the actions of in-
dividual Business Lines;

+> the Contractors’ engagement, to improve the safety
