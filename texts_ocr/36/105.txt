Supplementary healthcare assistance
and complementary pensions

The majority of countries in which the Group operates offer
supplementary health insurance policies at advantageous con-
ditions with respect to the alternatives available on the mar-
ket. In many cases it is the Company that provides benefits
related to prevention and periodic check-ups (refer also to the
chapter on “Occupational health and safety”). For all Italian em-
ployees and their dependent family members, in agreement
with trade unions Enel set up the Supplementary Healthcare
Provision for Enel Group Employees (FISDE) in 1997. The Pro-
vision disburses repayments and redemptions for healthcare
expenses, promotes initiatives for the disabled and individuals
subject to socially challenging situations (drug addiction, alco-
holism, learning difficulties, psychological-social disorders) and
sets up preventive medicine programmes. Also in 2019, mem-
bers were able to take advantage of symposia with the Italian
National Council of Psychologists (CNOP) and Psychoanalytic
Society (SPI) for psychological support services. In line with the
FISDE solidarity principle, also ex Enel employees can continue
to benefit from the services offered by the Provision by contin-

Supplementary assistance programmes for employees,
their family members and communities are also supplied
thanks to the protocol of social action attached to the col-
lective bargaining agreement. The measures to support
personnel includes the facility to access additional pension
funds and the award of various types of individual benefits in
services associated with employee severance indemnity. At
December 31, 2019, employees covered by the Enel Group
pension plan totalled 70% of the population. Pension funds
exist mainly in Italy (Fopen and Fondenel), Spain, and Brazil.
Enel has drawn up an insurance policy to cover the Group's
over 68,000 employees worldwide in the event of hospitali-
zation with the Covid-19 virus. The insurance tool, which was
specifically designed for the needs of the Enel Group, repre-
sents the first ever of its kind in the world aimed at guarantee-
ing support at global level for the ongoing pandemic and will
guarantee additional benefits on top of all other insurance pol-
icies and forms of health care already used within the Group.

As from 2016, Enel people travelling to destinations considered at risk are provided with specific information detailing
the healthcare situation and safety conditions of the countries in question. In particular, by means of the company travel
reservations system, the Security Travel Guide and Health Guide are sent out before departure, with any necessary
updates integrated during the trip. In relation to specific risks associated with the destination, whenever necessary
Enel prepares suitable protective measures (expert guides, bodyguards, etc.). To coordinate the entire process, a 24/7

supervisory function supports personnel during travel, monitors the relevant news reports and coordinates responses
in the presence of situations of objective danger or emergency. The model is active in all Group countries, guaranteeing
100% coverage of international and intercontinental travel with the integrated Travel Security system.

Industrial relations

Enel complies with labour law in the various countries and

 

the conventions of the International Labour Organization
(ILO) concerning workers’ rights (freedom of association
and collective bargaining, consultation, right to strike, etc.),
systematically promoting discussion between social partners

and seeking an adequate level of agreement and sharing of
corporate strategies by employees. In 2019, the percentage
of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements
was 91.2%, in line with the figure for 2018 (91.5%).
