limited documentary evidence procedures, in order to collect information about the processes

financial data and information to the management responsible for the preparation of the DNF.

Furthermore, for significant information, considering the Group activities and characteristics:

business model, policies implemented and main risks, we carried out inquiries and
acquired supporting documentation to verify its consistency with the available evidence;

procedures and limited assurance procedures to ascertain on a sample basis the correct
aggregation of data.

material aspects, in accordance with the requirements of articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI
Standards.
