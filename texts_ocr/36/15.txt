Sustainability context

Technological acceleration, growth and
ageing of the world population, climate
change, scarcity of resources, and shift-
ing geopolitical balances are among the
main forces shaping the watershed mo-
ment that the world is currently under-
going.

Ascenario that has been further compli-

cated by the recent spread of the Coro-

navirus epidemic (Covid-19) in many
parts of the world.

The main trends lead to the need to:

+ redefine and reinvent the role of
companies, characterised by in-
creasingly blurred boundaries and
skills, resources and know-how ev-

er-more interchangeable between
sectors;

+> rethink urbanisation, taking ac-
count of sustainability challenges
such as climate change, chronic
diseases, ageing, economic acces-
sibility and the technologies that are
transforming modes of transport,
consumption, and labour;

> define a new world of work, in
which the methods of preparation
for business of the future will be
diversified and more dynamic and a
new leadership model will emerge;

LEXI Annual Report

Report on corporate governance

Due to the nature of its business and the
associated distribution of countries and
regions, the Enel Group is exposed to
various types of Environmental, Social
and Governance risk (ESG). In identify-
ing potential risks the results of the pri-
ority analysis were considered together
with the risk assessments carried out in
the framework of the human rights due
diligence process carried out by Enel,

and the recommendations of external
bodies such as the World Economic Fo-
rum (WEF) Global Risk Report 2020 and
the results of several highly accredited
international ESG rating agencies. The
analysis takes account of the assess-
ment of the risk perceived by the main
external stakeholders, in the absence of
checks. Mapping of the risks in question
is in line with the approach adopted to
identify the main company risks (finan-
cial, strategic, governance, operating,
digital and compliance), in relation to
which continual monitoring is carried
out through the Company's internal au-
diting process.

with markets, businesses, and gov-
ernments, in line with the evolution
and interaction of Al (artificial intel-
ligence), machine learning, increas-
ingly widespread sensors, smart
devices and new computational in-

> promote “adaptive” governance
that is more open, more flexible and
more in line with change.

The new scenarios make it necessary to

define new business models, promote

different forms of inter-sector collabo-

ration, and develop increasingly innova-

tive financial instruments.

In particular, the main ESG risks identi-

fied are as follows.

Environmental dimension:

> climate risks: physical risks arising
from climate change could cause
damage to assets and infrastruc-
ture resulting in their enduring un-
availability. Moreover, the transition
towards a zero-emissions energy
model could involve risks arising
from normative/regulatory, _politi-
cal, legal, technological and market
changes associated with the fight
against climate change;
