In September 2019, Enel further enhanced its commitment by
setting a new target for 2030, with which it undertook to reduce
direct CO, emissions per kWh,, (Scope 1) by 70% compared
with 2017. This target, for direct emissions from electricity pro-
duction, is nearly three times as ambitious as the previous tar-
get for 2020 and is fully aligned with the Paris Agreement. In
addition, the objective has been certified by the Science Based
Target Initiative, ensuring consistency with the well below 2C
pathway and the B2DS IEA’s scenario, which is currently the
most ambitious certification criterion available for the utility sec-
tor. They define an energy system development path and an
emissions trajectory with at least 66% chance of limiting peak
warming between present and 2100 to below 2 °C.

This acceleration in Enel’s decarbonization roadmap is also
a response to the appeal of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) as part of its effort to strengthen
the global response to the climate change threat. Included in
the special report, the appeal warns of the impacts of global
warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and the related
global greenhouse gas emission pathways.

In parallel with direct emissions, Enel has set a new target,
also certified by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), to
also reduce indirect emissions associated with the consump-
tion of gas by Enel’s end-user customers (indirect emissions
from the use of products sold), which represent a significant
source of indirect Scope 3 emissions, by 16% by 2030.

1. Includes direct emissions due exclusively to energy generation. Other direct emissions are not considered in the definition of the target as they are conside-
red marginal and satisfy the exclusion criterion according to SBTi methodology that fixes a margin of 5% of the total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

2 Scope 1 as of 2020 in line with the IEA 2DS scenario. As of 2020 the reduction in CO, emissions is equal to 25% of the base year 2007.

3 Scope 1 by 2030, in line with the Well Below 2C path of the Science Based Targets initiative and with the IEA B2DS scenario. As of 2030 the reduction in

CO, emissions is equal to 70% of the base year 2017.
