Considering these transition scenarios and models of the
energy system, Enel determined their impact on the vari-
ables that most greatly affect our business, such as elec-
tricity demand, the system energy mix and the increase in
electricity consumption due to the electrification of final
consumption.

The transition effects over the medium term can produce
new opportunities, thanks to the growth of renewables,
and potential risks linked to the loss of profitability for
thermal plants. Based on assumptions about future reg-
ulatory developments and market trends, it is possible to
forecast developments in output in the Group’s electric-
ity markets (for now, Italy and Spain only) and unit mar-
gins. These considerations offer a basis for determining
the Group's possible strategic positioning in terms of re-
source allocation (for example, maintaining or increasing

our market share in renewables or accelerating the phase-
out of obsolete technologies).

By 2030, the dynamics of the energy transition may pro-
duce significant opportunities in the retail electricity mar-
ket. The progressive electrification of final consumption,
especially in transportation and the residential sector, will
lead to a significant increase in electricity consumption.
Considering the transition scenarios developed by the
Group for Italy and Spain, the increase in electricity con-
sumption in the domestic segment could produce an in-
crease of more than 300 million euros in EBITDA by 2030
compared with 2022. Considering a more optimistic tran-
sition scenario, i.e. one with a higher electrification rate
for transportation and heating/cooling, the effects could
be even greater, leaving unchanged the assumptions for
margins and market share set out in the Plan.
