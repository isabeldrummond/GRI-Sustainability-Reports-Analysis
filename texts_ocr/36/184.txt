reviewed their own structures in terms of this “plastic free” initiative. Where it was not possible to eliminate single-use

cutlery and crockery, these items were replaced by compostable materials. This initiative was launched in conjunction

with a communication and awareness campaign seeking to encourage all employees to engage in responsible behaviours

in the workplace as well as at home.

It is estimated that in 2019, this reduced the consumption of 27 t of single-use plastic, saving 59 t of CO, emissions,
1,300 m* of water and 532 MWh of electrical energy. Thus it is envisaged that plastics will be completely eliminated
from main offices by 2021, well in advance of the deadline set by the new European directive. In Italy and Spain,
in particular, the project foresees a reduction in the consumption of single-use plastic in the administration offices
respectively by 91% and 65% compared to 2018. Similar targets will be defined throughout the course of 2020 for all

the countries where the Group operates.

Furthermore, during the subsequent stages of the project, ZERO will be also extended to the supply chain.

Soil, subsoils and subterranean waters

 

Enel continues with its commitment to using the most ad-
vanced technologies available as well as applying best prac-
tices during the construction, operation and the decommis-
sioning of its power stations to minimise any potential envi-
ronmental impacts caused by its activities. Among the various
areas of prevention, the highest level of attention is focused
on the safeguarding, monitoring and reclaiming of soil,
subsoil and subterranean water in the areas occupied by
its plants wherever it operates globally. The safeguarding of
these environmental factors is the driver, starting from the
very first life-cycle phase of every plant, to every project
choice and management decision. Both active and passive
protection and safety measures will be used to prevent any
possible form of uncontrolled or accidental contact of poten-
tially polluting substances (fuels, reagents, liquid and waste
flows) with soils and subterranean waters. At the same time,
during plant operations, every process will undergo compli-
ance controls as well as ongoing upgrades as required by the
Environmental Management Systems to prevent and mini-
mise the risks of any potential environmental contamination.
In the event of an accident, the application of the Stop Work
and Emergency Management Policies aims to eliminate any
possible environmental impact, rigorously complying with the
provisions and the legal obligations of the various countries.

Environmental sustainability

Thus, before power plants come to the end of their life cycle
and are dismantled, and before the reassignment of the area
to new development projects, Enel can, according to the
authorised provisions and legal requirements of the various
countries, verify the environmental quality of the soil, subsoil
and groundwater in the areas where the plant is located.

In the case of potential contamination due to an accident or
in light of inspections carried out on the end of life plants,
Enel, based on the intervention plans agreed with the com-
petent authorities and inspection entities, can characterise
the environmental matrices in the areas of potential interest,
and implement, if necessary, safety and remediation proce-
dures, to restore, in a timely manner, a suitable quality status
for the planned use of the area (industrial/commercial, resi-
dential). Particular focus is on power plants falling within the
large industrial hubs.

In case of spills, mostly related to thermal generation and
energy distribution, the Group reacts with prompt contain-
ment interventions as well as the subsequent environmen-
tal remediation are carried out by specialist companies, ac-
cording to procedures imposed by local regulations and best
internal practices. To mitigate further risks related to hold-
ing substances which could have an environmental impact,
there are various pilot programmes in course which involve
the use of vegetable oil, a biodegradable oil, to replace the
traditional insulation mineral oil.
