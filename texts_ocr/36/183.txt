Future project, by using selective demolition techniques of

produced

In order to identify and to continue more targeted and ef-
ficacious improvement initiatives, particular attention was
paid in 2019 to assessing the quantities of hazardous waste
across the Group's main geographic areas focussing on the
waste products generated from the management of the
electricity distribution networks and their recovery pro-
grammes. The main waste products in this sector mainly
comprise dielectric mineral oils used in the insulation of elec-
trical equipment and end-of-life accumulators used as ener
gy reserves in transformation stations. Once classified as
waste products, these oils are sent to companies registered/
authorised for regeneration and waste-to-energy treatment,
where regeneration is not possible, whereas the end-of-life
accumulators are sent to registered/authorised companies
that can recover secondary raw materials.

Particularly relevant within the scope of the Business Line
infrastructure & Networks are the results obtained by the
projects launched across various countries for the sustain-
able replacement of intelligent first-generation meters
and the recovery of their constituent materials. Specifi-
cally, in Italy, in 2017 a campaign was launched to replace
around 31 million smart meters, and by the end of 2019, over
6 million smart meters of first generation were replaced. A
meter comprises 65% plastic, with the remaining materials
being iron (12%), copper (7%) and electronic circuit boards

(7%). These materials can be properly recovered in autho-
rised processing plants and so become reusable resources
in other production cycles. From the perspective of the cir
cular economy, even non-plastic materials are completely
recyclable: electric circuit boards for example can be sent for
gold recovery, copper can be used in the production of brass,
iron in the building industry.

In relation to the overall data reported, in 2019, Enel pro-
duced approximately 72 mil t of waste of which 99% were
classified as non-hazardous. All the waste produced by the
Group's activity was sent to authorised sites based on their
waste classification, prioritising and maximising their re-
covery, in line with the Group's policies. The quantities pro-
duced were 20% less than in 2018°. This variation is due to
a lower production of waste from the thermal power plants,
specifically from coal-fuelled plants. Waste products sent
for recovery across the whole Enel structure counted for
approximately 19% of the total waste produced; a slight im-
provement on the previous year. The waste reduction target
in terms of quantity amounted to 20% compared to the base
year 2015 and was achieved a year in advance.

Enel has therefore set itself a further target: a 40% reduc-
tion in waste production by 2030 compared to the reported
totals in 2017 This target is based on results already achieved
and takes into account, in addition to the three-year Industrial
Plan which envisages an evolution of the energy mix towards
renewable energies, the best projections currently available
for the period subsequent to the plan's time frame.

The “ZERO, towards a plastic-free world” project aims to gradually eliminate the use of single-use plastics within the
Enel Group. The World Environment Day, June 5, 2019, saw Enel at the forefront of the global fight for a better planet,
empowering the whole Group, with tens of thousands of people engaged actively in protecting the environment.

The project was launched in Italy and Spain, and will be extended to other countries where Enel operates, from 2020
onwards. This involves the elimination of single-use plastics from the Group's main offices and will be subsequently
extended to all the administration headquarters and finally to the industrial sites.
