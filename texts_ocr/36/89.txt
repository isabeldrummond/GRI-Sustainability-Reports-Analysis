In order to supply the new solutions, Enel X is structured in

five Global Product Lines:

> eCity: for public and artistic lighting, energy efficiency,
safety and optical fibre;

> e-Home: for the development of smarter homes, capa-
ble of reducing energy consumption and guaranteeing
greater well-being, for renewable generation with inte-
grated solutions that also include storage;

+ e-Industries: to offer an integrated and tailor-made ser-
vice to customers, from strategic consultancy to energy
monitoring systems and efficiency technologies, from
distributed generation to the smart use of batteries, as
well as microgrid solutions in isolation and connected to
the network and the most advanced demand response
systems

> e-Mobility: to promote electric mobility with increasing-

ly innovative solutions, thanks to recharging infrastruc-
ture, new technologies and second life battery services;
+ Financial Services: to provide innovative solutions in
the payments and financial services sector. Specifically
in the context of its development strategy and the sup-
ply of financial services, Enel X has completed the acqui-
sition of a 55% stake in PayTipper, a payment services
company with a widespread network of sales points
that offers its customers financial services to facilitate
people's daily lives
In addition to the five Global Product Lines there is also an
Innovation & Product Lab, which designs, develops and
tests new products and services, also with the contribution
of customers.
Below are some of the projects developed or being tested:

Enel X: a constantly evolving circularity laboratory

EERE At a Glance

Enel X is a circularity accelerator within its ecosystem of suppliers, partners, installers and customers. The aim is to

speed up circularity through the Circular Economy Boosting Program, which is not only applied to portfolio solutions,

generating a verified score, but also provides for industrial and public administration customers to obtain an Energy Cir-

cularity Report, which measures energy circularity and identifies a structured roadmap to increase it by implementing

a series of innovative solutions.

More information about the process is available on the dedicated website at: https:/Avww.enelx.com/it/en/circular-econ-

omy.

The starting point for the Circular Economy Boosting Program is the Circular Economy Score, which allows the degree

of circularity of the solutions in the portfolio to be measured. 51 solutions have already been evaluated in 4 countries

relating to: public lighting in Italy, Spain, Chile and Colombia; public and private recharging, juice lamp, residential photo-

voltaic, storage systems, residential boiler and solar thermal in Italy; residential air conditioning in Italy and Chile. Sample

results are available at www.enelx.com and www.enelxstore.com.

In 20 cases, based on these assessments, specific “circular intelligence” activities were carried out (analysis of the

market context, scouting of innovations and startups) in order to identify opportunities to enhance the circularity of the

various solutions, effectively completing the Circular Economy Boosting Program.

Furthermore, in 2019, Enel X undertook to start various projects related to the circularity pillars, including:

> “product as a service” - Second Life Platform as a Service: Enel X offers its customers in Italy innovative energy
service solutions linked to the reuse of photovoltaic panels previously partially used in the Enel value chain;

> “extension of useful life” - regeneration of juice pole replacement parts: working with its suppliers, Enel X has
introduced recovery and regeneration processes for the functioning spare parts of juice poles, with the aim of reus-
ing them for maintenance and repair both in Italy and Spain; similar processes will also be applied in Latin America.
