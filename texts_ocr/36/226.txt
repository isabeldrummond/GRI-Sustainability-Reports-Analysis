1 In 2019, the analysis of reports received in 2018 was completed, and for this reason, the number of confirmed violations for 2018 was restated from 30 to 31
The additional violation is attributable to reasons of a supplier's compliance with the law on overtime.

ceived, up on 2018, mainly due to the change in the scope of
consolidation in Latin America. From the reports received, 8 ep-
isodes of violation were identified as cases of “conflict of inter
est” for which Enel adopted specific measures against the par
ties involved, in line with the relevant regulations, which involved
7 actions against employees and 4 actions against contractors.
As far as cases relating to labour practices are concemed, 74 re-
ports were recorded, of which 11 were identified as violation: 3
cases concerning harassment, 7 cases concerning the company

Organisational and Man-
agement Model pursuant
to Legislative Decree 231/01

Legislative Decree No. 231 of 8 June 2001 introduced into
the Italian legal system an administrative (but essentially
criminal) liability for companies, for certain types of offences
committed by their directors, managers or employees in the
interest or for the benefit of the companies themselves. Al-
ready in 2002, Enel — the first in Italy - adopted an Organisa-
tional and Management Model that meets the requirements
of Legislative Decree 231/01 (Model 231). Since then, it has
been constantly updated in line with the reference regulato-
ry framework and current organisational context.

In compliance with the 10th Global Compact principle, ac-
cording to which “companies are committed to combating
corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery’
Enel intends to pursue its commitment to fighting corruption
in all its forms — whether direct or indirect — by applying the
principles expressed in the pillars of its Anti-bribery Manage-
ment System.
Enel's Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) is based
on the Group's commitment to fighting corruption by ap-
plying the criteria of transparency and conduct as set out
in the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan (ZTC Plan) and
confirmed in the Anti-Bribery Policy adopted pursuant to
international standard ISO 37001:2016 (on anti-bribery man-
agement systems).
Together with the ZTC Plan, the pillars underpinning the
ABMS are:
> the Code of Ethics;
> the Models designed to prevent the main crime risks (for
example, corrupt relations with public administrations
and private individuals, environmental crimes, corporate
offences and, for Italian companies, manslaughter, seri-
ous personal injury or grievous bodily harm committed
in violation of the rules on the protection of occupational
health and safety), as described by the applicable regula-
