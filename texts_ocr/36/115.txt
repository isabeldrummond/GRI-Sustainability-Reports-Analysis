 

Fighting energy poverty
in developed countries

Although access to energy is guaranteed in developed coun-
tries, there are consumers who struggle to pay their ener-
gy bills, following the serious global crisis that has affected
low-income families in these countries in particular. Even if
governments have the primary responsibility of guarantee-
ing sustainable, safe and economic access to basic energy
services, the electric sector can contribute towards promot-
ing sustainable social-economic development.
Enel has always been committed to collaborating with gov-
emments to combat energy poverty and promote access to
energy for the vulnerable population of developed countries.
Enel’s commitment to reaching SDG 7 has been amplified
in that sense and for 2030 it will involve all the countries in
which the Group operates, and not just developing coun-
tries such as Africa, Asia and Latin America (see the para-
graph “Listening to stakeholders, knowing the territory and
measuring created value” in this chapter).
Over the past years, Enel has adopted different forms of
support, often through existing government initiatives, in
order to reduce the cost of the energy bill for vulnerable
customers in developed markets, such as Italy, Spain and
Romania (see also the paragraph “Care of vulnerable cus-
tomers” in the chapter “Infrastructure, eco systems and
platforms”).
Various campaigns and activities were also organised to
provide the population living in vulnerable conditions with
advice about responsible energy consumption.
Here are some examples of the projects carried out in Spain:
+> energy volunteer programme, launched by Endesa
and the Endesa Foundation with the purpose to help
low-income families by providing them with specific

advice about responsible energy consumption by dis-
tributing energy efficiency kits and, in some cases,
introducing improvements to the electrical systems
of the most vulnerable families. In many cases, the
programme helped obtain an average reduction in the
energy bill of up to 30%. This initiative is managed by
volunteers, from Endesa staff, in close collaboration
with civil society organisations. In 2018-2019, the pro-
gramme benefited more than 2,400 families, 772 of
them in 2019. The 2020 edition of the project has also
been started;

training in responsible energy consumption and bill
optimisation, which in 2019 resulted in the organisa-
tion of three training sessions held in Tenerife, Fuerte-
ventura and Zaragoza, with the participation of approxi-
mately 77 institutions that estimate providing advice to
approximately 9,000 people per year who struggle to
pay their energy bill;

ative against energy poverty (pilot project Re-
luCe), an innovative management method for the con-
sumption of electricity through a pre-paid system that
also permits providing information regarding how to

 

save money by promoting efficiency consumption and
the control of family expenses. During 2019, 18 families
in Bilbao who participated in the project were able to re-
duce their electrical expenses by 23%, and almost 70%
of these families adapted their consumption based on
the proposed recharges. The system sends a warning if
a high rate of consumption is detected, notifies if close
to reaching the available balance, sends messages to
encourage efficient consumption attitudes. Finally if the
customer, when reaching the balance, does not make
the pre-paid recharge, the power is reduced to a level
that permits covering basic needs, therefore avoiding
an interruption of the service.
