Communication channels and legal

proceedings

Specific communication channels were defined to provide
information and respond to all the questions from the com-
munity regarding the project (dedicated web page, social
channels, newsletter, etc.). In 2019, approximately 1,000
complaints were received through the community relations
offices regarding the services and commitments included
in the Environmental License, to which prompt responses
were given. In 2019, 177 accompaniment and consultancy
visits were carried out in the four resettlements. Additional
initiatives and information about the projects are available in
the Emgesa Sustainability Report 2019 (https://www.enel

850 MW EGP-Nareva consortium

wind power program

In March 2016, a consortium of three companies, Enel
Green Power, Siemens Wind Power and the Moroccan pow-
er company Nareva, was awarded the project for the devel-
opment, construction and management of five wind plants
in the communes of Midelt, Tanger, Jbel Lahdid, Boujdour
and Tiskrad with a total installed capacity of 850 MW. Their
construction will require a total investment of approximately
1 billion euros.

In preparation of the tender process described above, Enel
Green Power carried out a preliminary analysis of the social,
economic and environmental context (SEECA) with the help
of external specialists in the areas where it planned to build
the plants. The SEECA identified the relevant social-econom-
ic issues and the specific needs of the local communities
