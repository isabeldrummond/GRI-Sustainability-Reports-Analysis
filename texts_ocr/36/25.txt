Climate change is the main global chal-
lenge of the 21st century, and can only
be answered via the active engagement
of all interested parties, including the
private sector. Enel is fully aware of this
challenge and has developed a business
model aligned with the objectives of the
Paris Agreement and achievement of
decarbonization of its energy mix with-
in 2050. A strategy confirmed in 2019,
responding to the UN call to action and
signing a pledge to limit the global tem-
perature rise to 1.5 °C and to achieve
zero emissions by 2050. The transition
must also be fair and inclusive for all,
promoting far-reaching actions based on
climatic, energy-related, environmental,
industrial and social aspects.

In order to orient its climate strategy,
Enel has analysed the various climatic
scenarios, both physical and transition-
al, and identified the main risks and
opportunities in the short, medium and
long term. In the 2020-2022 Strategic
Plan Enel has assumed a commitment
to the decarbonization of generation and
consumption, simultaneously pursu-
ing electrification of end customers to
deal with climate change and guarantee
affordable and clean energy. Enabling
factors for decarbonization and electri-
fication are identified in infrastructure
and networks, and also ecosystems
and platforms. Specifically, with regard

   
   

to decarbonization, investments are
planned over the next three years in the
amount of 14.4 billion euros, the ma-
jority of which addressed to higher re-
newable capacity, with average annual
growth of 4.7 GW, for a total capacity of
14.1 GW. This will bring the proportion
of renewables, in terms of total installed
capacity, to 60% within 2022. Moreo-
ver, a parallel reduction of coal produc-
tion of around 74% is planned by 2022,
compared to 2018.

In September 2019, Enel announced
the new goal of reducing direct emis-
sions of greenhouse gases per kWh,,
by 70% within 2030, compared to 2017,
this objective being certified by the
SBTi. In confirmation of the constant
commitment to this matter, 2019 saw
the continuation of the downward trend
in CO, emissions, which allowed Enel
to reach the certified objective of 350
g/kWh,,, established in 2015, in 2020 -
one year in advance. In fact, CO, emis-
sions linked to the generation of elec-
tricity totalled 296 g/kWh,,, hence 20%
less than in 2018. In addition, around
55% of electricity generated in 2019
was CO, free, and the installed renew-
able capacity was 42 GW (50% of the
total net capacity in 2019). This capacity
is increased by the capacity managed
via the BSO model (“Build, Sell and Op-
erate") equivalent to 3.7 GW.

In order to guarantee increased trans-
parency in
relationships with stakeholders, Enel
periodically reports on its activities in
line with the international standards of
the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and
is publicly committed to adopting the
recommendations of the Task force on

its communications and

Climate-related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board,
which published specific recommenda-
tions for the voluntary reporting of the
financial impact of climate risks in June
2017. The Group has also integrated the
“Guidelines on reporting climate-related
information” published by the European
Commission in June 2019, taking into
consideration the results of the first
work performed by the European Lab
Project Task Force on Climate-related
Reporting (PTF-CRR), which collects the
associated best practices (“How to im-
prove climate-related reporting”).

The following table shows the alignment
of Enel's disclosure both with respect to
the European directive and with respect
to the TCFD, testifying to the Group's
commitment to climate change related
disclosures.
