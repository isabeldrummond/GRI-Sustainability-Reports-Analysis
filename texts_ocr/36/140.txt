Projects

All cyber security projects, programmes and initiatives are designed to avoid, mitigate or remediate IT security risks
for the entire Enel Group. Consequently, all cyber security activities - which are managed with a risk-based approach
following the principle of security by design — give rise to a continuous due diligence process that also includes self-as-
surance activities.

The most significant projects include “Cyber Security Awareness Solution’ launched in 2019 with the aim of identi-
fying and adopting a platform that allows the execution of awareness campaigns that are pervasive, adaptive and active,
with adequately calibrated informative contents based on the level of exposure of individuals to cyber threats. The
project is aimed at adopting a solution capable of delivering the above contents to all Enel Group people and to various
appropriately identified third parties within 2020.
