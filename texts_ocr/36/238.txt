How this document
has been constructed

The Report has been prepared according to the GRI Stand-
ards: Core option and the supplement dedicated to the Elec-
tric Utilities sector issued by the GRI in 2013 (Electric Utilities
Sector Disclosures). In particular, the Global Reporting Initia-
tive's Sustainability Reporting Standards (2016) (GRI Stand-
ards) have been considered; with effect from financial year
2018, Enel has also adopted the two new standards, GRI 403
— Occupational Health and Safety and GRI 303 —- Water and
Effluents, issued in 2018.

 

Methodological note

The content formulation process has been based on the prin-
ciples of relevance (“materiality”), stakeholder inclusivity,
sustainability context and completeness of the data and in-
formation: Enel reports information regarding its performance
within the broader sustainability context, also discussed in a
specific section (see the “At a Glance” chapter and the sec-
tions “The pillars of our sustainable business model” and
“ESG backbones”), including specific references to the Sus-
tainable Development Goals ("SDGs") in its objectives and
