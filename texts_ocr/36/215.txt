Enel’s presence in the main energy
and sustainability associations

 

The Enel Group plays an active role in associations and sus-
tainability organisations, at both national and international
level, which set long-term goals and commitments to pro-
mote a sustainable way of doing business and to manage
the challenges of climate change and socio-economic pres-
sures affecting the macroeconomic environment, particular
ly in the energy sector. Below are some examples.

United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) - Enel has been a
“Participant” member of the United Nations Global Compact
(UNGC) since 2004 and is one of its 2019 LEAD companies.
This group of companies represents the participants most
involved in the initiative, thanks to their commitment and
adherence to the 10 founding principles on human rights,
labour standards, environmental protection and the fight
against corruption. In 2019, Enel also demonstrated its com-
mitment by taking part in the Action Platforms “Financial In-
novation for SDGs‘ “Pathways to Low-Carbon and Resilient
Development’ “Reporting on the SDGs" and “Peace, Jus-
tice & Strong Institution’ as well as submitting an advanced
Communication on Progress (CoP).

The Group's leadership — resulting in a strategy and actions
based on the above principles to achieve the SDGs -— also
gave Enel the opportunity to be part of the UN Global Com-
pact Expert Network, an advisory group which provides an
essential strategic contribution to defining the organisation's
planning priorities and agenda. Moreover, Enel’s CEO is a
member of the Global Compact Board and is currently in
his second term (2018-2021). He has therefore renewed his
commitment to supporting the sustainability initiative which
has been ongoing since 2015, when he was appointed for
his first term.

In 2019, in light of the key importance of climate change at
international level, the Group was among the first 28 signa-
tories of the Business Ambition for 1.5 °C Pledge, where-
by it committed to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 °C
from pre-industrial levels and achieving zero emissions by
2050. It also pursued its commitment by participating in the
platform.

Furthermore, during 2019, Enel confirmed its commitment
as a sponsor within the “Financial Innovation for SDGs” Ac-

214

tion Platform, which comprises the “CFO Taskforce for the
SDGs” of which Enel holds the joint presidency. This initia-
tive represents an innovative dialogue platform between var
ious Chief Financial Officers around the world, with the aim
of promoting sustainable finance and scalable investments
to achieve the SDGs.

As part of the United Nations programme, Enel is also an
endorsing company of the “Caring for Climate” initiative to
promote the role of businesses in tackling climate change,
and the “CEO Water Mandate’ which was set up to support
businesses in sustainable water management. Since 2015,
Enel has been a signatory company of the Women's Empow-
erment Principles (WEPs) to promote gender equality within
the private sector, in the workplace, on markets as well as
in communities.

CSR Europe - CSR Europe is the European business net-
work dedicated to sustainability, of which Enel has been
a member since 2005. The Group has held the position of
Deputy Chair of the Board since 2016, and in 2019 had its
term renewed for a further three years. Enel takes part in
the organisation's activities, themed meetings and projects
and, in 2019, it was one of the first signatories of the “CEOs
Call to Action’ an appeal backed by many Chief Executive Of-
ficers and addressed to the new European political leaders,
for Europe to become a driver for change by adopting a new,
development model in line with the 2030 Agenda objectives.
The initiative will lead to the development of the Pact 4 Sus-
tainable Industry in 2020 to foster a European industry that is
increasingly climate-neutral, circular and resource-efficient.
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) - Enel has been a mem-
ber since 2006, and since 2016 it has been part of the GRI
Community and the Stakeholder Council — the multi-stake-
holder consulting body that supports the GRI Board of Di-
rectors on strategic issues. On top of its participation in ac-
tivities shared among GRI Community members, Enel has
continued its commitment within the Corporate Leadership
Group on Digital Reporting — a two-year programme focus-
ing on the main challenges of digitalizing information and
possible solutions for making external reporting more and
more efficient. Importantly, the Group's work will result in
