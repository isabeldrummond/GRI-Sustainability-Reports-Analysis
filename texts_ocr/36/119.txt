joint effort with the associations Canalistas del Laja and Can-
alistas del Canal Zafiartu, Direccién de Obras Hidraulicas, Di-
reccion General de Aguas, Enel Generacion Chile, Ministerio
de Agricultura, Ministerio de Energia and Comision Nacional
de Riego. There is also an agreement with the municipality
of Antuco in order to start a pilot project to promote tourism
in the area of Salto del Trubunleo during summer. In order
to manage possible contingent or emergency situations in
a quick and coordinated manner, a specific communication
system was defined between the power plants of Pangue
and Ralco of Enel Generacion Chile, the Angostura di Colbun
power station, the municipalities of Alto Bio Bio, Quilaco and
Santa Barbara, the Ministry of the Interior and Public Securi-
ty (ONEMI) and the Ministry of Energy. For further informa-
tion, please refer to Enel Chile and Enel Generacién Chile

Just a bit more south, in the region of Los Lagos, in the Map-
uche community of Mapu Pilmaiquén, a project was started
to return approximately 6 hectares of indigenous land near
the Pilmaiquén hydroelectric power station. Today, the com-
munity manages this territory with a sustainable tourism
project, opening the area’s ecosystem to visitors, which is
explained according to the Mapuche cosmovision of con-
servation of the equilibrium of natural resources. This are-
as, which is called Parque La Isla, welcomes approximately
6,000 tourists every year, which brings economic benefits to
the community. A large amount of their profits are invested
in park conservation. Thanks to the training of local artisans
and the growing flow of visitors, an increasing number of
people can benefit from this project by selling their products.
To guarantee the presence of the beautiful waterfalls, Enel
Generacion Chile releases the water from its hydroelectric
operation to the benefit of local tourism.

In the region of Maule, where Enel Generacion Chile shares
the available water in the hydroelectric basins with the agri-
cultural sector, a project was started already in 2015 for the
optimisation of the agricultural irrigation process, in collabo-
ration with CITRA (Center for Irrigation and Agroclimatology
Research ) of the University of Talca. Thanks to the adopted
techniques, it is possible to reduce water use by more than
40%. More than 700 farmers were trained in sustainable irri-
gation techniques and experimental fields were started with
the local agricultural school to train the new generations.

EI Quimbo plant (Colombia)

El Quimbo is the most imposing civil engineering project
realised by the Enel Group over the past years and rep-
resents one of the greatest hydroelectric investments in
South America. The power plant has an installed capacity
of more than 400 MW and is located in the region of Huila,
south-west of Bogota. With a shared and participatory ap-
proach, starting from December 2014, a multi-year plan of
social-environmental projects was defined in favour of the
local population, and in particular families living in or owning
property in the area of project influence, as well as those
who work or have business activities and services in this
area. The families that were surveyed and who meet the
requirements were given the possibility to decide between
relocation (collective/individual) and the sale of their land.
Of the 152 families who decided for relocation, 40 selected
individual relocation, receiving land for their productive and
residential project. The remaining 112 families opted for
relocation in the collective settlements (Montea, Santiago
y Palacio, Llano de la Virgen, San José de Belén), with new
homes provided with essential services and inserted with-
in an urban context with schools, churches, multi-purpose
sports facilities, a football field, green areas, a waste recy-
cling centre and waste water treatment plants. Each family
also received 5 hectares of land with an irrigation system
in order to develop their own productive activity (crops or
mini ranches).

Social-cultural management

In 2019, within the scope of the policy of creating shared
value with the community of the collective resettlement of
San José de Belén de le Veredas, La Galda and Yaguilga,
of the municipality of El Agrado, in the Department of Hui-
la, 20 wells for the irrigation of the crops were constructed
and placed in operation’. Meetings continued and were in-
tensified between the elderly, children and young people of
the resettled communities, to promote the transmission of
the historical memory of the area and intergenerational ex-
change. Two training courses were held for the community
leaders, together with seven support activities for the main-

4 Even if in 2018 an agreement was reached with the communities for the
construction of 23 wells, at the end of 2018 an agreement was signed
for the construction of 21 wells, and, in 2019, 20 were built, as 3 families
decided to withdraw from the project.
