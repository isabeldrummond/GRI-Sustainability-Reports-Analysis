Environmental
governance

Strategic factors in the planning, implementation and development of Enel's op-
erations include the protection of the environment and natural resources, com-
bating climate change as well as contributing towards sustainable economic
development. Moreover, these represent determining factors in consolidating
the Company's position as leader in the energy market.

Since 1996, Enel has been pursuing a Group environmental policy, updated in 2018,
and as stated in the opening of this chapter, this policy has been implemented
across the Company structure and across its entire value chain’.

Enel oversees all environmental-related activities by means of a structure that ex
tends across the operational units with standardised general environmental policy
guidelines, emanating from one central Holding unit. Across the Business Lines and
Global Service Functions, structures, dedicated personnel and managers ensure the
operational implementation of these common strategic guidelines. In particular, Staff
Functions coordinate the management of relevant environmental issues, ensuring the
necessary specialist support in line with the Holding guidelines, whilst the operational
units manage the specific aspects related to the various industrial sites.

Enel Data on Environment (EDEN)

In 2019, Enel introduced an environmental reporting system called Enel Data on
Environment (EDEN). This is an advanced, easy-to-use, and robust tool that col-
lects and manages environmental data whilst also supporting the management
of environmental improvement strategies across the various divisions, in addi-
tion to collecting all the environmental data for the annual Sustainability Report
of all the Group companies.

EDEN is capable of recording over 1,750 environmental variables broken down
into thematic units (fuels, emissions, waste, water, soil, consumables, stock
materials, operational data, environmental improvement interventions, etc.) cal-
culating specific KPIs in line with the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative).

As well as a multitingual tool, it can input data for each individual technology, for
different organisational levels (plant, country) and different user profiles. As soon
as any data is entered it undergoes formal controls and consistency assessments.
and subsequent series of validations. In the various countries where Enel ope-
rates, over 250 personnel with over 20 training sessions were trained in its use.

Enel Group's environmental policy extends across the entire value chain and applies: to all the production
phases of every product and service, including distribution and logistic phases, in addition to related
waste management; to each site and building; all the relationships with external stakeholders; all merg-
ers and acquisitions; every key business partner (including partners related to non-managed operations,
joint ventures, outsourcing or third-party producers); every supplier, including service and contractor
suppliers; all due diligence processes as well as and Merger and Acquisition processes.
