environmental protection require
companies to implement specific
actions to minimise their environ-
mental impact. The rising popula-
tion and economic growth generate
impacts correlated with the scarcity
of resources and management of
water. There are also existing risks
connected to water crises, due to
climate change and the level of wa-
ter resource exploitation

Social dimension:

tisks linked to human capital: rad-
ical transformations of the energy
sector call for the presence of new
professional profiles and skills. Or-
ganisations need to move into line
with new agile and flexible busi-
ness models, and policies affirming
diversity and for management and
promotion of talent become key
elements for companies that are
negotiating the transition and have
a widespread presence in countries
and regions;

tisks linked to occupational
health and safety: these risks are
due to the execution of operat-
ing activities on the Group's sites
through its assets, the identification
of which was carried out by analys-
ing the main events that have oc-
curred in the past three years;
risks linked to local commu
engagement: presence in such a
vast perimeter of countries and re-
gions necessarily calls for the eval-
uation of very different scenarios
and radical knowledge of each area
and the needs of the various stake-
holders. In this context, the devel-
opment of infrastructural projects
could resultin criticism or situations
of partial acceptance, exposing the
Group to reputational and opera-
tional risks linked, for example, to
delays in execution or even closure
of projects.

Business and governance dimension:

risks linked to business conti-
: partial or total interruption
of operating and/or sales activities
could result in exposure to the risk
of penalties, losses and reputational

 

 

damage;

risks connected with cyber at-
tacks: the digitalization and tech-
nological innovation era results in a
growing level of exposure of com-
pany assets to ever more frequent
and sophisticated cyber attacks;
tisks connected with digitaliza-
in, IT effectiveness and service
continuity: the Enel Group is per-
forming a complete digital trans-

 

formation of the entire value chain,
which makes it more exposed to
risks associated with operation of
IT systems and which could lead to
service interruptions or loss of data
risks connected with the protec-
tion of personal data: the Group's
growth on a global scale in terms
of the number of customers and
countries and regions implies a nat-
ural exposure to risks associated
with personal data protection, also

 

in consideration of the increasingly
voluminous legal regulations con-
cerning data protection, non-com-
pliance with which can lead to an
economic/financial and reputational
damage;
compliance possible in-
fringements of laws and regulations
and the principles set down in the
Company's Compliance Programs
could result in exposure to the risk
of judicial or administrative penal-
ties, economic or financial losses
and reputational damage.

texts addressed by Legislative Decree
no. 254/16 concerning human rights
and the fight against corruption is given

tainability Report. The “Principal ESG
risks” table of the “Sound governance”
chapter shows the Group's methods of
management and mitigation actions, to-
