> Integrated Response: coordinated incident manage-
ment between all components involved (communica-
tion, security, institutional affairs, technical lines).
In all cases where it is not possible to turn to public forc-
es and it is necessary to use private security guards, Enel
ensures that: all human rights assessments are made; the
workers of security service providers have received appro-
priate training; contracts include human rights criteria; and
that adequate equipment is provided to security guards.

Training and information

In 2019, approximately 820 thousand of training on sustain-
ability issues were provided, of which human rights has
been a fundamental part. In particular, the courses mainly

addressed environmental and occupational health and safety
issues, with an average of 16.5 hours of training per capita,
which is up from the 2018 figure (11.9 hours). At the end of
2018, a new online training course on human rights was also
launched. This course is Enel’s way of renewing its commit-
ment to this topic, involving all Company people by sharing
experiences and best practices that highlight the key role of
human rights. During 2019, approximately 11,000 people at-
tended the course for a total of about 3,700 hours (0.3 hours
per capita).

For further details see the following chapters: “Sustainable
supply chain” (forced and child labour), “Our people and their
value” (diversity), “Community and sharing of value” (Rela-
tions with local communities) and “Occupational health and
safety” (occupational health and safety).
