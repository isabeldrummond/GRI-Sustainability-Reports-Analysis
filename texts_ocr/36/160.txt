Supplier qualification
system

Enel has set up a supplier qualification system for the care-
ful selection and evaluation of companies wishing to par
ticipate in procurement procedures. The system assesses.
the technical, financial, legal, environmental, health and
safety requirements, human rights and ethical integrity
to ensure the proper level of quality and reliability of any
awarded contracts.

Each supplier, taking into account their business, can un-
dergo a qualification process for one or more Merchandise
Categories (MCs): suppliers are only deemed suitable
when they meet specific requirements set out for each
MC. An accurate and comprehensive analysis is constant-
ly carried out of the MC tree involving Enel’s Global Pro-
curement units, business units and competent HSEQ ar
eas, by mapping the activities in each MC and assigning
a risk level to each issue (security, environment, human

  

rights, spending, irreplaceable supplier, etc.). Following the
above-mentioned risk assessment, each MC is grouped into
different families associated with their respective assessed
risk. Qualification requirements vary based on the implica-
tions and specific impacts associated with each group: for
example, for a MC with a high environmental risk, the Envi-
ronmental Management System ISO 14001 certification is
usually required, while for MCs with a high safety risk, it is
also required to have the Health and Safety at Work Manage-
ment System OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 certification.

The assessment system is regulated by an internal proce-
dure and was established in accordance with the relevant
laws and regulations. It also includes various assessment
procedures to take account of the above-mentioned risk
classes.

The system requires compliance with the principles set out
in the Code of Ethics, the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan
and Model 231, the Policy on Human Rights, the UN Global
Compact with specific reference to the non-conflict of inter
est (even potential conflicts) and — depending on the specific
