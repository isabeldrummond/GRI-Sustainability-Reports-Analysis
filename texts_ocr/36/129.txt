Innovation
and digitalization

Innovation and digitalization are key factors of Enel’s strategy of growth in a fast
changing scenario, guaranteeing high standards of security, business continuity and
operating efficiency. They involve the traditional business and the development of
new technologies, both internally and externally to the Company, assuring solutions
offering long-term sustainability.

The Open Innovability
ecosystem

Enel operates by means of an Open Innovability model in which the solutions, apart
from being innovative, guarantee long-term sustainability both for the business and
for communities, creating shared and shareable value. An ecosystem based on open-
ness and sharing that makes it possible to connect all company areas with startups,
industrial partners, small and medium-sized enterprises, research centres, universi-
ties and solver ecosystems, by means of various tools such as crowdsourcing plat-
forms (openinnovability.com) and the Innovation Hubs network. To date, there are 83
innovation partnership agreements in place, of which 6 new agreements both
global and horizontal within the Group signed in 2019, in addition to the relaunch
of existing collaborations to facilitate access to credit by the startups and small and
medium-sized enterprises operating in the Enel ecosystem. The partnerships make it
possible to develop new solutions for electric mobility, microgrids, energy efficiency,
the industrial loT, and circular economy solutions, in addition to traditional areas of
action such as renewables and conventional generation. Furthermore, a process of
collaboration with the aerospace sector was launched in 2019, focused on the use
of satellite technology for surveillance of power grids to prevent network losses and
energy theft, and to promote cyber security.

Over the past year Enel has opened 1 new Hub in Boston, consolidating its pres-
ence in the world’s leading innovation ecosystems with 10 Innovation Hubs (Sili-
con Valley, Boston, Tel Aviv, Madrid, Moscow, Santiago, Rio de Janeiro, Milan, Pisa
and Catania) and 5 Innovation Labs (Milan, Pisa Catania, Haifa and Sao Paulo). The
