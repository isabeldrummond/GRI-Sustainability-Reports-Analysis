INVESTMENT HOLDING

The process of reporting anomalies, risks and dangerous situations by workers through the "blue
cards" takes place in complete transparency in order to encourage maximum participation of wor-
kers in the accident prevention process. These methods favour transparency and confidentiality, as
reporting potentially dangerous situations is a benefit for one's own good and for the good of the
community in terms of prevention, health and safety.

Workers actively participate in health and safety prevention initiatives through information ses-
sions, classroom and on-the-job training and through specific channels, including periodic meetin-
gs, "5-minute HSE meetings’, "HSE dialogues" and application of the SESSE programme.

HSE committees have also been set up at each plant, convened by location management, involving
the local hierarchy, the PPS, the WSR and, if necessary, the company doctor. At each site, accidents
involving employees are analysed to identify their causes and consider preventive measures and
suitable protection. Information on accidents is disclosed at Group level, so as to anticipate events
at other locations.

The steps taken to reduce risks include interventions that are technical (EC-marked machines
equipped with safety systems and subjected to periodic checks, forklifts subjected to periodic
checks and equipped with warning systems such as horns, flashing lights and BlueSpot safety
lights), procedural (specific procedures, contingency plans) and behavioural through continuous
information and staff training. The training courses are split between:

= external courses required by legislation (the basic course on safety and specialist courses for
particular tasks or use of equipment);

= internal courses on the cultural approach to health, safety and environmental protection, to
promote virtuous behaviour and involvement at all levels.

5.4 Italgen

For Italgen, the protection of health and safety in the workplace are fundamental values to be inte-
grated into all of its activities. Attention to these issues is demonstrated concretely by the Health
and Safety Policy, in compliance with Legislative Decree 81/2008, and by the Workplace Health
and Safety Management System (WHSMS), implemented voluntarily according to the UNI-INAIL
Guidelines, which applies to all employees and staff of external companies entrusted with works
and contracts at all company offices.

Personnel are directly involved in the development and review of policies as well as in the identifica-
tion, assessment and management of risks, through periodic coordination meetings and constant
debate.

The company identifies the dangers, assesses the risks and defines the necessary prevention and
protection measures in the RAD, prepared in accordance with Legislative Decree 81/2008 and sub-
sequent amendments. The risk analysis takes into consideration legislative compliance, historical
background (history of the location, accidents and occupational diseases that occurred previously),
context (the company organisation, the health and safety aspects related to individual activities,
the infrastructure, equipment and materials present in the workplace) and human resources (the
behaviour of the staff and their skills), in order to define objectives and continuous improvement
measures appropriate to the specific reality.
