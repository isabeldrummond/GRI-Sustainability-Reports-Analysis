5. HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK

32 The data relating to the acci-
dents of external collaborators
only include the categories of
temporary workers, self-employed
workers, project workers, interns
and agents and not other types
of non-employed workers who
operate at the Group's sites and/or
under the control of the Group, in
consideration of their significance
and the availability of such data
over which the Group does not
exercise direct control.

33 For comparative purposes, the
2018 data relating to the person-
nel of the Sirap Group have been
restated following a process of
improvement of the reporting sy-
stem implemented during 2019.

 

An essential condition for the enhancement of Italmobiliare's human capital is the creation of safe
workplaces, where people can work serenely and express their skills to the full. With the active
support of the holding company, the Group companies are at the forefront of risk prevention and
the promotion of a culture of safety, through the implementation of the most suitable management
systems to protect the psychological and physical integrity of employees and everyone else who
works, has access or spends time in spaces and structures belonging to the Company.

During 2019, 15 recorded accidents took place within the Group, a 46.6% decrease compared with
22 in 2018; one of these, occured in a production site of Sirap France due to the crushing of a pha-
lanx, has resulted in an absence of more than 180 days. 82.3% of these accidents were at Sirap
Group plants, which saw a 21.4% reduction compared with the previous year thanks to the exten-
sion of integrated systems for the management of health and safety at work adopted at group level
to the companies acquired in 2018 (Sirap UK, Sirap France, Sirap Iberica and Sirap GmbH). During
the year, Group companies collected data on accidents of external collaborators and suppliers
who work at the production plants and administrative offices*; there were 2 events involving these
categories of workers, out of a total of 279,043 hours worked.

For Italmobiliare, safety is closely linked to the psychological and physical well-being of its people,
which the Holding Company and Group companies also promote by offering employees a wide
range of health and social security benefits.
