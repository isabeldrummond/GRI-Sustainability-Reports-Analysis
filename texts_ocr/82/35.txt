3.3.1 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES

Sustainable development has always been one of the fundamental drivers of Italgen, which stron-
gly believes in the close union between economic growth and social and environmental responsibi-
ity. Ever since its foundation, the company has been constantly committed to guaranteeing an ever
greater production of energy from renewable sources, minimising its impact on the ecosystem.

talgen's Environmental Policy, guaranteed by the Environmental Management System (EMS), is an
essential element for strategic planning since it provides a general direction and a set of short and
medium-long term objectives to improve production performance and energy efficiency. Applica-
ion of the policy pervades the entire organisation, through training initiatives and the sharing of
information and objectives with staff at all levels.

The EMS is an integrated system for Quality, Environment, Health and Safety, which guarantees
he organisation's ability to provide a product and service that constantly meet the requirements
established by customers and regulatory requirements, carrying out the activities with full respect
or the environment. The Management System was adapted in 2017 to the new editions of the
ISO 9001: 2015 and ISO 14001: 2015 standards, is documented in a Management Manual, and
attached procedures/instructions. The latter governs the responsibilities of personnel and the ope-
rating procedures adopted to keep monitoring the environmental aspects of the business and im-
proving its performance, while ensuring the organisation's compliance with regulatory obligations.

2019 saw the renewal of the EMAS Registration for the three-year period 2020-2022 as well as
validation by the Certiquality Institute and the Ecolabel - Ecoaudit Committee of ISPRA of the EMAS
2019 Environmental Declaration, including the Environmental Analysis which identifies the signi-
ficant impacts of Italgen's activities . The evaluation is carried out considering the following ele-
ments:

 

= Potential to do damage and size of the environmental impact (D);

= Environmental and territorial context, vulnerability of the receptors (C);

= Frequency, i.e. the probability that an environmental impact could occur (F);
= Complaints and stakeholders’ views (P);

= Legal aspects (L).

Compliance with environmental legislation is monitored periodically through internal audits, plan-
ned and managed according to a specific procedure. Monitoring any new requirements from EU,
national and local legislation is guaranteed by a central function which carries out a preliminary
and general assessment of whether the new measures are applicable to the company. Following
legislative changes or additions, Management evaluates the action to be taken, which may be of an
educational/informative, procedural, managerial, analytical or technical/structural nature.

3.3.2 ENERGY MANAGEMENT

The company has a production structure in Italy that consists of 15 hydroelectric plants in Lom-
bardy, Piedmont and Veneto for a total installed capacity of 58 MW and 300 kilometres of tran-
smission lines. It also holds a financial minority stake (49%) in a company that manages two wind
plants in Bulgaria with a total of 18 MW.

Italgen’s hydroelectric plants are of two types: impoundment and "run-of-the-river". An impound-
ment facility, typically a large hydropower system, uses a dam to store river water in a reservoir.
Run-of-the-river plants, on the other hand, use the natural flow of water and therefore only allow
real-time management of the water that can be taken from the river bed. The water, either collected
