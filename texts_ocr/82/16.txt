1.5 Ethics, integrity and transparency

1.5.1 BUSINESS ETHICS AND INTEGRITY

Italmobiliare ensures that its business activities are carried out in full compliance with the prin-
ciples of ethics and integrity and in total compliance with current economic, social and environ-
mental legislation. The Company introduced its own Code of Ethics for the first time in 1993 and
subsequently modified and updated it, most recently in 2018. The Code states a set of values and
principles underlying Italmobiliare's business and establishes its rules of behaviour and conduct.
This document therefore represents a solid set of values for the Company and its subsidiaries, a
necessary condition for ensuring a constructive exchange of ideas with all stakeholders and inte-

Fairness, dignity and

protection of the
Legality Integrity individual
from all forms of
discrimination and
exploitation
Countering money Fight against Transparency
laundering and criminal . and

of the Code apply, without exception, to all employees and to all those who, directly or indirect-

objectives. Violation of the rules laid down in the Code of Ethics harms the relationship of trust
established with the Group and can lead to disciplinary, legal or criminal action or, in the most se-
rious cases, it can lead to an interruption of the work relationship or termination of the employment
contract.

The main Group subsidiaries (Sirap Gema S.p.A., Italgen S.p.A., Caffé Borbone S.r.l., Clessidra SGR
S.p.A.) have in turn adopted their own Code of Ethics, undertaking to disseminate it, update it and
make any tools available to encourage its full application.

Ever since 2004 Italmobiliare S.p.A. has also applied an Organisation and Management Model pur-
suant to Legislative Decree 231/2003 ("the Model"), setting up a Supervisory Body as required. The
Model is based on a preliminary risk assessment that allows the Company to identify potential risk
