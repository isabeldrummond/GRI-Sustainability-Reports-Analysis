Sustainability Report | HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK | F59

The main sources of risk identified in the RAD are:

= Electrical risk;

= Risk for working night shift, at heights and in isolated places;
= Mechanical risk;

= Risk due to use of vehicles for work transfers and commuting.

The staff is specifically informed and trained to respond effectively and safely to routine and
non-routine situations, including emergencies or situations of potential risk, in accordance with
the Emergency Plan and related procedures. The "Non-Conformity, Corrective Actions and Pre-
ventive Actions (NC, CA, PA), dangerous events" Procedure defines the operating procedures with
which accidents, near-accidents and episodes of non-conformity with the WHSMS are treated and
analysed, in order to take the consequent steps and, where necessary, implement corrective and
preventive actions. Employees can report actual or potential violations of the WHSMS to the Su-
pervisory Body anonymously via e-mail or ordinary mail, as foreseen in the whistleblowing system
implemented under Model 231.

In the company there is a PPS, coordinated by the HPPS with the managers in charge, the company
doctor and the WSR. The Service meets once a year and, informally, when the company doctor car-
ries out his annual inspections. The latter is in charge of the medical surveillance envisaged in art.
41 of Legislative Decree 81/2008, including the medical visits required before issuing his opinion
on a persor's suitability to do a particular job, with any subsequent investigations and in-depth
studies that may be necessary. He also advises the employer on all aspects related to safety and
health and gives first-aid training.

 

In order to verify periodically compliance with the requirements of the WHSMS, including the orga-
nisation's legislative compliance and the adequacy of the risk assessment, an Internal Audit Group
is also active, coordinated by an external Team Leader, for the performance of an annual Audit
Plan.

Employee training takes place through periodic meetings in power plants to discuss safety mana-
gement, with particular reference to the prevention and protection of risks identified for specific
duties.

Italgen's commitment does not stop at the protection of safety in the workplace, but also includes
active promotion of the health and well-being of its employees, by offering the same health benefits
that Italmobiliare S.p.A. employees can access (see page 2).
