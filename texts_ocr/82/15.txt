INVESTMENT HOLDING

THE SUSTAINABILITY POLICY

n line with its mission as an investor committed to "playing an active and continuous role in the
process of growth and enhancement of the portfolio, combining development, internationalisation
and innovation with an effective governance and risk management model", Italmobiliare considers
sustainability, in its broadest sense, economic, social and environmental, as an essential lever of
competitiveness. In order to make this vision fully operational, in 2019 the Company introduced a
process of strategic planning for sustainability, aimed at an explicit integration of the ESG factors
in the Holdings business strategy and the implementation of increasingly effective supervision of
subsidiaries and associates in matters of social and environmental responsibility.

To this end, Italmobiliare identified in the Sustainability Policy adopted in 2019 the appropriate tool

(0 orient active dialogue with the portfolio companies on ESG issues and guide the consequent
measurement and evaluation of their performance.

The Policy is split into 5 Pillars of Sustainability, which constitute the guidelines for a direct appli-
cation of the principles of sustainability by Italmobiliare in carrying out its activities and a homoge-
neous framework of commitments shared with the other Group companies, with the aim of guiding
and harmonising the specific initiatives launched in each area of activity. The ESG Plan associates
he Pillars with a system of qualitative and quantitative objectives connected to medium-term time
horizons, allowing constant assessment of the Group's ESG performance and monitoring of the
level of integration of sustainability in the business strategies of the individual portfolio companies.

 

The Pillars were identified on the basis of an analysis of the strategic, competitive and regulatory
context in which Italmobiliare and the portfolio companies operate, combined with the requiremen-
's of the main stakeholders engaged during the materiality analysis.
