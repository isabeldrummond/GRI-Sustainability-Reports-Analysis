The distributors, which are located in the operational headquarters at Villa di Serio (BG) and at
certain plants, also contribute to Italgen’s sustainable mobility policy, which promotes the use of

vehicles with reduced environmental impact: in fact, each distributor supplies energy from its hy-

3.3.4 WATER MANAGEMENT

Italgen's main sources of water are the Adda, Oglio, Dezzo, Povo, Brembo, Cassiglio, Stabina, Serio,
Gesso, Vermenagna and Meschio rivers: almost all of the water is used for production purposes.
In particular, it is taken by means of intake works from surface waterways and used by the plants
for the production of electricity, after which it is released downstream from the plant. During the
production process, the water is not consumed, nor modified in its chemical and physical cha-
racteristics. Italgen's commitment to the protection of water basins and biodiversity takes place
concretely through the release of the Minimum Vital Runoff, the installation of fish ladders and the
repopulation of fish species in the waterways where the plants are located. The amount of water
used in turbines for conversion into electricity in 2019 was 5,663 MI.

talgen is fully authorised to use water for production purposes, through concessions received in
accordance with applicable legislation. The company guarantees constant control of the microcli-
matic data of the areas where it operates (quantity of rainfall, temperatures, volumes of reservoirs)
and is available to provide such data to associations, municipal bodies or anyone who requests it.

talgen's water withdrawals and discharges concern basins and freshwater streams and do not
affect areas subject to water stress.

n the EMAS Environmental Declaration, water supply is assessed as a significant environmental
aspect of medium importance, while the use of water for civil use is not significant. As for dischar-
ges, art. 114 of Legislative Decree 152/2006 entrusts the Regions with regulation of the returned
water used for the production of electricity, effectively subtracting this activity from regulation of
he discharges, which can be further divided into civil and atmospheric.

The former are occasional and of low volume, generated by the plants' toilets and conveyed to a
pit and then drained by sub-irrigation in the surface layers of the subsoil, subject to authorisation.
For the latter, the environmental relevance was assessed as extremely low as no external operating
activities are carried out, with the exception of extraordinary maintenance performed during major
overhauls of the machinery.
