5.5 Clessidra SGR

Clessidra has implemented a workplace health and safety management system, pursuant to Le-
gislative Decree 81/2008, which covers all employees and the activities they carry on at the one
office in Milan. The Workplace Safety Management System (WSMS) has the purpose of assessing
risks, verifying the adequacy of preventive measures and verifying the improvement over time of
the measures to guarantee that the health and safety levels already in place get better over time,
and possibly integrate or modify it as appropriate. The most serious risks identified are external to
the workplace and concern the use of company cars.

The company divulges the WSMS to its employees by distributing documentation and giving sui-
table training. The employees, on the other hand, are required to report immediately any shortco-
mings in vehicles and instruments, as well as any dangerous conditions that they become aware
of, taking direct action in an emergency to the extent that they are able to.

Clessidra uses a consultancy that carries out preventive activities and is in charge of advising the
employer, workers and their representatives in the organisation, on the requirements for establi-
shing and maintaining a healthy and safe working environment, which facilitates optimal physical
and mental health in relation to work and adaptation of the job and workers’ abilities in light of their
physical and mental health.

The PPS meets once a year and/or at the request of one of its members. Refresher courses are
held periodically for the specific training of the WSR and compulsory training for employees, as
well as a five-year update from the date of the first 6-hour training aimed at all workers. Emergency
workers have received adequate specific training and receive periodic updates.

 

All employees benefit from health insurance: full cover for middle managers and white collar wor-
kers and supplementary cover for managers. Managers are also entitled to an annual check-up at
a leading hospital.
