in reservoirs or derived directly from the river, is sent to the hydroelectric power plant employing
tunnels, penstocks and canals. The principal "machine" of the plant is the turbine which, driven by
the power of water, converts hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. This, in turn, is converted
into electricity by an electric generator and returned via a transformer to the high voltage lines that
transport and distribute the energy throughout the territory.

In order to ensure constant monitoring of the production process, during 2019 the company com-

pleted the installation of a centralised supervision and remotecontrol system for in-process mo- Italgen energy

nitoring and remote management of 15 hydroelectric power plants and related intake works. The
system, managed centrally from the operational headquarters in Villa di Serio (BG), ensures the
collection of all the basic data for monitoring operating conditions, allowing to trace the quality of
the production process, to check the status of components of the machines and of the system in
general and to intervene remotely for a different balance of production, also in response to specific
situations. Central availability of data makes it possible to extract precise figures for management
reports and trend analyses, facilitating interaction with external entities. The system also raises the
safety levels of the plants, thanks to measurement and alerting tools that enable to manage the
situation and any alarms, with operator consoles to help detect any anomalous situations.

Thanks to these systems, in 2019, there were no accidents or plant malfunctions that could have
caused physical injury to people.

3.3.3 EMISSIONS

A hydroelectric power plant does not generate atmospheric emissions in the process of generating
electricity. Any emissions are attributable exclusively to the use, in emergency conditions, of die-
sel-powered generators and to the sporadic use of portable welding machines supplied to certain
plants.

The consumption of electricity, fuel and auxiliary materials for maintenance purposes does not
constitute a significant environmental issue for the organisation. In order to further limit the related
impacts and increase production efficiency, in 2012, Italgen began a process of reducing self-con-
sumption, which continued in 2019 with the installation of new lighting systems with LED lamps at
the hydroelectric plants and related works (intakes, tunnels, dams, etc.).

A tangible and concrete sign of the company's commitment to environmental sustainability are the
clean energy distributors, which make it possible to monitor, directly on the website, the levels of
distribution of energy from renewable sources of the hydroelectric power plants owned, the num-
ber of barrels of oil equivalent saved and the simultaneous reduction of carbon dioxide emissions

consumption

26 The company did not acquire
Guarantee of Origin certificates
for the purchase of energy from
renewable sources neither in 2019
nor in 2018.

27 For the values referring to the
fuel used for the car fleet and the
relative emissions reported in this
chapter, estimates were used. For
cars for mixed use, 70% of total
consumption was considered.

28 For comparative purposes, the
2018 data relating to Italgen energy
consumption have been restated,
following a process of improve-
ment of the reporting system imple-
mented during 2019. For previously
published data, please refer to the
