6.3.1 CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY AND
CORRECTNESS AND TRANSPARENCY IN PRODUCT
INFORMATION

One of the focal points of the Group's policy is continuous improvement, which translates into
actions to optimise and enhance the effectiveness of the health, safety, quality and environmental
management systems. Sirap is constantly striving to ensure the highest quality of its products,
subjecting each phase of the production process to more than 1,100 daily checks in all of its fac-
ories: overall, more than 200,000 quality controls per year are a guarantee for customers, while
consolidating the company's high level of competitiveness. In addition, each year the internal la-
boratory collaborates with universities and research institutes to test more than 3,000 products in
relation to their food and technological suitability, mechanical, thermal, optical, chemical-physical
properties of materials, gas permeability and structural analysis. The legislative conformity of fini-
shed products is checked periodically by accredited third-party laboratories, guaranteeing, together
with constant process control and the use of suitable raw materials, the production of compliant
and healthy products. Specifically, most Sirap plants, with the exception of the Petruzalek plant in
Hungary, are ISO 9001 certified for their quality management system.

Each item is accompanied by an information card, which contains the information needed for use
and subsequent disposal. For new ranges, a leaflet is prepared with further information on all the
echnical and commercial aspects of the new products.

n every phase of the product, from design to construction, the correctness of all the information
reported in articles and supporting documentation is verified (article sheets; compliance documen-
s; labelling). The verification of technological suitability is validated by specific laboratory tests for
each application.
