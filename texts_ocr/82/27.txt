3.1 Caffé Borbone

3.1.1 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES

Caffé Borbone firmly believes in the need to combine economic development, social equity and
environmental protection. The Company complies with current legislation in this area and carries
on its activities on the basis of a correct and efficient use of natural resources.

In line with Italmobiliare's Sustainability Policy, Caffé Borbone adopts policies and practices ai-
med at minimising, mitigating and balancing the environmental impacts generated by its activi-
ties, implementing programmes for the continuous improvement of the technologies used and the
methods used to manage and control industrial processes. Particular attention is paid to integra-
ting the principles of the circular economy in the design, production and management of packa-
ging, according to a ‘life cycle thinking" model.

3.1.2 CONSCIOUS CONSUMPTION OF RAW MATERIALS

The consumption of raw materials is an aspect of fundamental importance for Caffé Borbone,
which mainly procures:

= Raw coffee

= Packaging materials, such as paper for pods, paper and cardboard for packaging, plastic and
aluminium

= Other products, such as sugar, cups and plastic, merchandising.

Procurement is carried out based on production needs, with the aim of minimising waste. During
2019, the SAP management system was implemented, which allows the measurement and mo-
nitoring of specific indicators relating to the use of raw materials, making it possible to further
improve food traceability and supply efficiency.

In 2017, the Caffé Borbone research and innovation team achieved the important goal of making
their pods compostable, thanks to the use of organic materials that can be reused to create com-

post.
