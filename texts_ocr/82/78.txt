GRI 403-9 The number and rate of recordable work-related injuries with
high-consequence work-related injuries and/or fatalities, divided by
employees and external staff and by countries during the period 2018-
2019

The recordable rate of work-related injuries is the ratio between the number of recordable work-related injuries and the number of
hours worked, multiplied by 1,000,000.

The rate of high-consequence work-related injuries is the ratio between the number of high-consequence work-related injuries and
the number of hours worked. multiplied by 1.000.000. High-consequence injuries are those from which a worker cannot recover.
does not recover or it is not realistic to foresee that they will fully recover by returning to their pre-accident state of health within 6
months.

The rate of deaths resulting from accidents at work is determined by the ratio between the number of deaths resulting from work-

related accidents and the number of hours worked. multiplied by 1,000,000.
Data do not include injuries as a result of commuting incidents where the transport has not been organized by the organization.
