4 The figure was calculated using the emission factor indicated in “Confronti internazionali, 2017", published
by Terna, according to the location based method. Figures of Scope 2 emissions are expressed in tons of CO,,
nevertheless the percentage of methane and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on total greenhouse emissions

(CO, equivalent), as inferred from the relative technical literature
