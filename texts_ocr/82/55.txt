5.2 Caffé Borbone

Caffé Borbone fulfils its health and safety obligations in accordance with current legislation and
has launched an Action Plan, approved by the Board of Directors, which provides for continuous
improvement in this area. In order to reduce potential risks, Caffe Borbone uses a prevention sy-
stem based on continuous training that involves all employees and follows a programme designed
to make workers aware of the risks and behavioural methods and to improve levels of health and
physical integrity.

The company has adopted a Occupational Health and Safety Management System compliant with
the requirements of Legislative Decree 81/2008 which covers all employees, visitors and suppliers
periodically present at the Caivano site, with reference to all company activities. The participation
of workers in the implementation and evaluation of the health and safety management system
takes place formally through the Workers’ Safety Representative (WSR), who is appointed by the
workers.

The assessment of work-related risks is carried out periodically by an independent entity, in accor-
dance both with the provisions of Legislative Decree 81/2008 and with a methodology that takes
into consideration the relationship between sources of danger and categories of operators, divided
on the basis of their duties, as well as other factors such as gender, age, origin, etc. The most se-
rious sources of danger identified in the Risk Assessment Document are:

= being hit by passing vehicles and forklifts
= fire due to flammable materials or substances

= being crushed by moving machine parts.

 

The results of the risk assessment are used to update the Action Plan, with reference to the techni-
cal prevention and protection measures and the programme for improving safety levels, as well as
for updating the internal signposting and programming of annual training activities.

In order to reduce situations of serious and impending danger, the company adopts an effective
system for reporting sources identified by workers or inefficient use of resources and devices,
through an immediate communication procedure. Workers also have the possibility of making
anonymous reports regarding the presence of risk and possible danger situations in digital form
through e-mail and paper, on which an assessment is made to decide if remedial action is requi-
red. Internal signposting and communication procedures indicate promptly how to get away from
sources of danger and escape routes.

 

There is the Prevention and Protection Service from internal health and safety risks (PPS), as requi-
red by articles 31 et seq. of Legislative Decree 81/2008 and subsequent amendments, coordinated
by the HPPS with the managers in charge, the company doctor and the WSR. In the event of acci-
dents, the PPS plans the corrective actions to be put in place together with the manager in charge
of the area concerned. The doctor is present at the headquarters to perform the health surveillance
tasks required by Legislative Decree 81/2008, which includes carrying out mandatory medical visi-
ts when anyone is hired, periodic health checks to prevent the onset of any occupational diseases
and any in-depth visits also concerning pathologies not related to the workplace.

 

Compulsory health and safety training includes a general part aimed at all newly recruited em-
ployees regarding regulations, risks and behavioural procedures, and a specific part aimed at those
in charge of particular obligations or functions relating to the management of company safety,
such as the persons in charge of particular areas, fire-fighters and evacuation workers, first aid
workers, WSR.

In order to promote the psychological, physical and relational well-being of employees, the com-
pany regularly organises in-house sports tournaments.
