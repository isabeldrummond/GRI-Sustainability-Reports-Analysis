Auditor’s responsibility

Our responsibility is to express our conclusion based on the procedures performed about the compliance of
the NFS with the Decree and the GRI Standards. We conducted our work in accordance with the criteria
established in the “International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) - Assurance
Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (hereinafter “ISAE 3000
Revised”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited
assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited
assurance whether the NFS is free from material misstatement. Therefore, the procedures performed in a
limited assurance engagement are less than those performed in a reasonable assurance engagement in
accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, therefore, do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would
become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable assurance
engagement.

The procedures performed on NFS are based on our professional judgement and included inquiries,
primarily with company personnel responsible for the preparation of information included in the NFS,
analysis of documents, recalculations and other procedures aimed to obtain evidence as appropriate.

Specifically we carried out the following procedures:

1. Analysis of relevant topics with reference to the Group’s activities and characteristics disclosed in the
NFS, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process in place in light of the provisions of
art. 3 of the Decree and taking into account the adopted reporting standard.

2. Analysis and assessment of the identification criteria of the consolidation area, in order to assess its
compliance with the Decree.

3. Comparison between the financial data and information included in the NFS with those included in the
consolidated financial statements of the Italmobiliare Group.

4. Understanding of the following matters:

* business management model of the Group’s activities, with reference to the management of the
topics specified by article 3 of the Decree;

* policies adopted by the entity in connection with the topics specified by article 3 of the Decree,
achieved results and related fundamental performance indicators;

* main risks, generated and/or undertaken, in connection with the topics specified by article 3 of the
Decree.

Moreover, with reference to these matters, we carried out a comparison with the information contained
in the NFS and the verifications described in the subsequent point 5, letter a).

5. Understanding of the processes underlying the origination, recording and management of qualitative and
quantitative material information included in the NFS.

In particular, we carried out interviews and discussions with the management of Italmobiliare S.p.A. and
with the employees of the subsidiary Caffé Borbone S.r.|., Sirap Gema S.p.A., Sirap France SAS, Italgen
S.p.A. and we carried out limited documentary verifications, in order to gather information about the
processes and procedures which support the collection, aggregation, elaboration and transmittal of non-
financial data and information to the department responsible for the preparation of the NFS.
