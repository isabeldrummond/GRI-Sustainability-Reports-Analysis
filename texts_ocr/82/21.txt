INVESTMENT HOLDING

As regards the risk of non-compliance with human rights, direct impacts are not significant for the
Group, in light of the geographical and sector context of operations and the safeguards implemen-
ted (Code of Ethics and Model 231). The risks generated indirectly through commercial relations
are restricted to Caffé Borbone only and limited by the configuration of the supply chain, represen-
ted by international intermediaries who adopt the highest standards of respect for human rights
(see Methodology).

Clessidra SGR, which is not involved in the Group risk assessment as it is not subject to manage-
ment and control by Italmobiliare, plays a similar role to that of the holding company towards its
subsidiaries.

The Risk Management function, which holds an independent position with respect to the operating
structures, reporting directly to the Board of Directors, is responsible for measuring, managing
and controlling all financial and operational risks inherent to the assets managed, as well as those
borne by the SGR and attributable to strategic, operational and reputational risks.

The internal risk management procedures provide for the following main activities of the Risk Ma-
nagement function:

= To implement effective policies and procedures to identify and monitor on an ongoing basis the
risks inherent to the investment strategy envisaged in the Regulation of each fund and to which
each fund is currently or potentially exposed

= To monitor compliance with the risk limits set in the Regulation of each fund and ensure that
the risk profile communicated to investors during the marketing phase is compliant

= To periodically update the Board of Directors at least every six months on the above issues, on
the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management process and on any actual or fore-
seeable violation of the risk limits set, so as to allow prompt adoption of appropriate remedial
action

= To review the policies and procedures adopted and evaluate the assets in portfolio by providing
support on the matter, ensuring that there is consistency between the results of the asses-
sment process and measurement of the riskiness of the assets.
