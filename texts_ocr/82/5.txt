1.1 Profile

ITALMOBILIARE S.P.A.

Italmobiliare S.p.A. is an investment holding company that owns and manages a diversified portfo-
lio of equity and other investments with a strategic vision based on a financial and industrial history
that goes back more than 150 years. The Company was founded in 1946 and has been listed on
the Milan Stock Exchange since 1980. It is controlled by EFIPARIND B.V., a company incorporated
under Dutch law, and is one of the largest Italian holding companies, operating across Italy and
Europe through the production activities of its main subsidiaries.

STORIA

1946 - the foundation

Italmobiliare was founded in 1946 by Italcementi S.p.A. as a vehicle to hold investments other than
those in the construction materials sector. Among the first transactions, Italmobiliare acquired a
number of controlling interests in the credit sector (Banca Provinciale Lombarda, Credito Commer-
ciale), in the insurance sector (RAS), in the publishing sector and in the extra-urban public transport
sector.

1950s - 60s

In 1952 an initial investment was made in Franco Tosi, an industrial company in the electromecha-
nical sector, which became a subsidiary in 1968. The presence in the banking sector developed in
the years between 1962 and 1965 through the purchase of eight local credit institutions, which in
1967 were concentrated in Istituto Bancario Italiano, later sold in 1982.

70s

The portfolio was strengthened in 1976 with the purchase of a significant minority shareholding in
Bastogi, later sold in 1986, which joined the one held in Falck.

In 1979, Italmobiliare became the holding company for the entire Group when it purchased the
majority of Italcementi ordinary shares.

80s

In 1980, Italmobiliare was admitted for trading on the Milan Stock Exchange. In 1984, the invest-
ments in RAS and Banca Provinciale Lombarda were sold as part of a Group reorganisation plan.
During the period 1988-90, a minority shareholding was acquired in Poligrafici Editoriale, as part of
an agreement with the Monti Group.

90s

In 1990, the Franco Tosi Group sold its industrial activity to the ABB Asea Brown Boveri Group, rein-
vesting part of its resources in the food packaging and insulation sector (Sirap Gema), the integral
water cycle and gas distribution (Crea).

In 1992, in the largest international acquisition carried out hitherto by an Italian group, the majority
of Ciments Frangais passed to the Italcementi Group, which thereby became a world leader in the
building materials sector.
