approach to ESG issues by involving the main subsidiaries and affiliates in achieving improvement
objectives within the 5 Sustainability Pillars identified as priority axes of commitment. For further
details on the Policy, see paragraph 1.4 of this document.

No significant residual risks were identified in the context of the risk management system of the
Parent Company and its subsidiaries relatively to environmental, social and personnel issues, hu-
man rights and the fight against active and passive corruption. The Group has started the process
of extending the analysis of the main risks generated and suffered, with an integration of risks in
the ESG area. The Italmobiliare Group is committed for the next few years to integrate its analyses
with respect to the impact generated and undergone in the "Climate Change" area and the related
reporting, also on the basis of the evolution of the relevant legislation. For further information on
the main risks to which the Group is exposed, please refer to the Risk Management paragraph (1.6)
of this document.

As regards the data on the health and safety of customers, the Parent Company is excluded from
the scope of this Report as it does not have any direct customers. For the same reason, the Parent
Company is excluded from the obligation to report on material aspects of the correctness and
transparency of product information.

 

The following is a summary of the main cognitive elements relating to the issues envisaged by
Legislative Decree 254/2016, art. 1.

Fight against active and passive corruption

The fight against corruption is regulated by the Model 231 and the Code of Ethics, adopted by all
the main Group subsidiaries, which provides that relations between the Group and third parties are
to be managed without resorting to illegal means and bribery, illicit favours, collusive behaviour,
solicitations of personal advantage for oneself or for others are explicitly banned. Within their own
Model 231, a system of whistle-blowing has been defined through confidential channels. Caffé Bor-
bone introduced a whistle-blowing system in 2019. For further details on these measures, please
refer to paragraph 1.5 of this document.

Social aspects related to personnel and respect for
human rights

Italmobiliare observes and supports universal human rights, also through the adoption of a human
resource management model in which the person is the focal point. The Group companies operate
as responsible and proactive employers, ensuring a working environment based on the values of
fairness, loyalty, transparency and mutual respect. The Code of Ethics states that relations betwe-
en employees must take place in mutual respect for the rights and freedoms of people and no
discrimination or retaliation must be made for reasons of nationality, religious belief, political and
union membership, language and sex.

Employees have the opportunity to best express their potential in a collaborative climate conducive
to professional and human development, in full equality of opportunity and treatment and having
respect for all forms of diversity, as enshrined in the Code of Ethics. For further details on the hu-
man resource management policies of Group companies, see chapter 4.

Italmobiliare S.p.A. and its subsidiaries have safety management systems that comply with natio-
nal and international regulations, and adopted time ago explicit policies and advanced tools for the
protection of health and safety in the workplace. These are detailed in chapter 5 of this document.
