Sustainability Report | THE ITALMOBILIARE GROUP | F19

Models, including ethical principles, codes of conduct, control tools, procedures and training acti-
vities aimed at preventing crimes (including the abuse of office and corruption) in compliance with
Legislative Decree 231/2001 and other applicable regulations.

In 2019, there were no episodes of violation of the corruption regulations within the scope of the
Group. As regards anti-competitive behaviour, only the Sirap Group is involved in an antitrust lawsu-
it initiated in 2015, the so-called Retail Food Packaging Procedure, which is still pending.

During the year, the Group companies did not receive financial penalties or sanctions for non-com-
pliance with laws and/or regulations on social and economic matters.

1.5.2 TRANSPARENCY

Transparency in relations with all stakeholders constitutes one of the guiding principles laid down
in the Code of Ethics. Italmobiliare undertakes to disseminate truthful, complete and comprehensi-
ble communications and information, so that all recipients can make informed decisions about the
relations to be maintained with the Company. This commitment also involves effective reporting
and communication of non-financial information, so as to provide stakeholders with a complete
representation of the Group's performance. This takes place in various ways: this consolidated
non-financial report, the section dedicated to CSR on the Italmobiliare website, the annual review
addressed to the financial community and the voluntary sustainability reports published indepen-
dently by the individual portfolio companies. In this regard, Sirap Group and Italgen S.p.A. will publi-
sh their first sustainability report in 2020 in conjunction with this consolidated non-financial report.

Clessidra also fully adopts the principle of transparency in its investment activities, with particular
reference to the reporting of ESG results. The SGR replies annually to the UN PRI questionnaire, pu-
blishing its Transparency Reports on www.unpri.org. Furthermore, to ensure transparency towards
investors, in the financial reports prepared in accordance with the Bank of Italy's instructions, there
is a specific paragraph about responsible investments. In addition, there is a quarterly report, ba-
sed on guidelines for the presentation of financial information (IPEV Reporting Guidelines) and for
valuations (International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines), which highlights
any critical issues and management's approach, also to issues of responsible investment. The
ESG performances of the portfolio companies are communicated to the Limited Partners through
a specific annual report.
