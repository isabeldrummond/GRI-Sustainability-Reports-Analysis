The Board of Directors has the task of defining the strategic guidelines of the Company and the
Group and is responsible for managing them. It is vested with all powers of ordinary and extraor-
dinary administration of the Company, as all matters not expressly reserved for the Shareholders’
Meeting by law and the By-laws fall under its remit. The Board of Directors is responsible for all
decisions regarding sustainability.

The following Board Committees have been set up:

conferred within pre-established limits, with the exception of those that the law and the By-laws
do not allow to delegate;

= the Risks and Sustainability Committee, made up of three Non-Executive Directors, the majority
of them independent, has a duty to provide the Board with advice and proposals on: i) the In-
ternal Control and Risk Management System (ICRMS); ii) periodic financial reporting; iii) social
sustainability matters linked to the exercise of the Company's business activities. Specifically
regarding sustainability, it gives the Board its advance opinion on the non-financial report; it mo-
nitors that there is adequate supervision of any sustainability issues involved in the Company's
business activities, also for non-financial reporting purposes, as well as the interaction with
stakeholders, the latter being understood as the recipients of non-financial reports.

= The Remuneration and Nominations Committee, made up of three Independent Directors, ma-
kes proposals to the Board regarding the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, Directors
vested with special powers and Key Management Personnel. The Committee also expresses
opinions on the size and composition of the Board and makes recommendations on the profes-
sional figures whose presence on the Board is deemed appropriate and conducts preliminary
investigations in order to prepare and review any succession plans for Executive Directors whi-
ch the Board of Directors has decided to adopt.

Regulation 17221 of March 12, 2010, made up of three Independent Directors, expresses its
