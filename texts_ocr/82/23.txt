Thanks to the positive performances of the portfolio companies and the investments made during
the year, Italmobiliare closed 2019 with a profit of 77 million euro, strong growth compared with the
previous year. Confirming the effectiveness of the investment strategy implemented by the Com-
pany and the solidity of the value creation model, the Group's NAV (Net Asset Value)! increased by
18.3% in 2019, from 1.42 billion euro in 2018 to 1.74 billion euro.

As is known, the dynamics of the global economic cycle, despite showing signs of stabilization and
possible recovery in the new year starting from the last quarter of 2019, suffered the effects of the
"Coronavirus" shock.

The impact generated through direct (demand) and indirect (business value chain) multipliers and
channels, is difficult to quantify even with respect to similar events (such as SARS), given China's
greatest weight on world growth and trade, and the stronger interconnection between different ge-
ographical areas. The potential effects of this phenomenon on the activities of Italmobiliare and of
the Portfolio companies cannot be determined to date and will be subject to constant monitoring
throughout the year.
