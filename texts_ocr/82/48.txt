Sustainability Report | RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS PEOPLE | F49

New employees are given an induction programme by the Head of Human Resources to facilitate
their entry into the organisation.

Like Italmobiliare, Italgen applies a remuneration policy based on a merit matrix that combines
performance and importance of the position on the external market in terms of remuneration.

Italgen provides a wide range of flexible fringe benefits for its employees and managers. A non-oc-
cupational life/accident and permanent disability policy is stipulated and a supplementary pension
fund is available with the Company topping up monthly contributions by a percentage laid down
in the national labour contract. Managers have access to supplementary health insurance that
also covers their families. A company car is made available for business and private use. Each
year Italgen pays scholarships (from the "school prize fund’) to the children of the most deserving
employees, to support and encourage excellence at school. Furthermore, during the mandatory
period of maternity leave, the mother's pay is supplemented so that she continues to earn 100% of
her normal salary.

Starting from 2019, Italgen's employees can also convert all or part of their performance bonus into
welfare services, taking advantage of the relief that makes the bonus completely tax-free (health,
school, reimbursements and leisure services). Starting from 2019, Italgen’s employees also have
the possibility of converting all or part of their production bonus into welfare services in the health,
education and leisure sectors

 

4.5.2 TRAINING

Italgen is attentive to the development and growth of its employees and uses training to obtain a
continuous growth of skills and to encourage the diffusion of corporate values and principles.

In addition to compulsory safety training pursuant to Legislative Decree 81/2008, the Human Re-
sources Department plans annual training initiatives aimed at developing skills and continuous
updating in the following areas:

= Business ethics and integrity, business strategies and sustainability
= Management training

= Technical and operational skills

= Quality, safety and environment

= Information systems

= Regulation and market.

As regards management training, in 2019 a course was prepared to develop managerial and le-
adership skills for the 5 Production Area Managers that embraced organisational, planning and
control topics, decision making and problem solving, leadership, personnel relations and time ma-
nagement. The 14 Heads of Function, even if formally not managers, also participated in courses
on issues of project management and effective communication within the company.

Given the depth of the technical and organisational changes introduced by the project for the auto-
mation and remote control of all hydroelectric power plants and related hydraulic works (see p. 2),
a specific training course was introduced in 2019 to develop the technical and managerial skills of
the positions most affected by the changes.
