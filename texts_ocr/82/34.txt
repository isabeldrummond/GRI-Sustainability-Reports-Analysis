3.2.5 WASTE MANAGEMENT

Waste management at Sirap is delegated to the individual production sites. The different types of
waste are delivered in special containers labelled with the respective EWC code and stored tempo-
rarily in special areas inside the sites, before transferring them to external centres authorised for

their recovery, storage or disposal.

21 For comparative purposes, the 2018
data relating to the Sirap Group with-
drawals, discharges and water consu-
mption have been restated, following a
process of improvement of the reporting
system implemented during 2019. For pre-
viously published data, please refer to the
Report of Sustainability 2018, published in
the Sustainability section of the website
www.italmobiliare.it.

22 According to the Aqueduct Water Risk
Atlas, the production site in Castiglion
Fiorentino (Arezzo) is located in an area

 

characterized by an extremely high risk
of water stress. The other plants are loca-
ted in areas characterized by low to me-
dium-high risks

23 Total water consumption of the Castel-
belforte and Verolanuova plant is based
on meter readings. Only the water used is
discharged into the sewers, while process
water is reused in a closed circuit. Having
no way of distinguishing the consumption
for sanitary purposes, this has been esti-
mated starting from the ISTAT data of the
per capita water consumption for the pro-
vince of Mantua (for the year 2011) equal
10 59.6 m

waste by disposal method

24 Almost all of the hazardous waste ge-
nerated by Sirap France in 2019 consists
of hydrocarbon water produced in clea-
ning the plants and not previously used.

25 The increase in waste generated by
the Inline plant (Poland) is due to the new
status attributed to mixed process by-pro-
ducts, which are now considered waste.
