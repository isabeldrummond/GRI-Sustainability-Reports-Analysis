medium to long term, by raising the value of the investments and generating a constant flow of
dividends. The Holding Company invests primarily in companies with a high growth potential in its
business and reference market, a strong aptitude for innovation and sustainability and adequate
managerial skills. From a geographical point of view, Italmobiliare focuses its investments on se-
lected markets, Italy in particular, with European or global exposure.

Capital allocation decisions focus on:
= long-term core majority interests, with clear development and/or value enhancement objectives

= potential investments in minority shareholdings with a focus either on stable dividend genera-
tion or strong growth

= a limited use of leverage.

In pursuing its mission, Italmobiliare is strongly convinced that an active approach to social and
environmental sustainability helps strengthen the effectiveness and reliability of its investment
strategies over time. Careful screening and monitoring of social and environmental risk profiles,
combined with the selection of industrial companies of excellence, capable of growing sustainably
while satisfying the requirements of all stakeholders, are in fact fundamental drivers for the sustai-
nable development of the portfolio.

The investment and development strategies of the portfolio and the related assessment and de-
cision flows are detailed in the Investment and Development Guidelines, introduced in 2018 and
updated in 2019. The document explains how to integrate ESG (Environmental, Social and Gover-
nance) principles into the investment process, that involve in particular the adoption of negative
screening criteria and due diligence:

= the exclusion (negative screening) from investment of sectors and activities that can directly
or indirectly hinder sustainable development or violate human rights, such as the arms trade or
the production of goods harmful to health and the environment;

= anin-depth analysis, as part of the due diligence carried out on companies identified as poten-
tial investments, of their ESG performance and level of exposure to related legal risks.

The attention paid to the sustainability profiles of newly acquired companies continues during the
phase of portfolio management, through active dialogue with the portfolio companies aimed at
promoting the inclusion of social and environmental sustainability aspects in the business strate-
gy, as outlined in Italmobiliare's Sustainability Policy (see Section 1.3).

During 2019, the investment in Capitelli (2% of assets under management) was approved after
carrying out an ESG due diligence.

CLESSIDRA SGR

The investment strategy adopted by Clessidra in the Private Equity segment qualifies as growth/
leveraged buyout, mainly focused on the acquisition of controlling stakes in unlisted Italian com-
panies. Clessidra’s objective is the construction of a diversified portfolio of equity investments with
an indicative value of between 200 and 1,500 million euro, in market-leading Italian companies of
medium-large size and with strong growth prospects. Through investments with control or joint
control, the SGR seeks to create value in the medium-long term and proposes itself as an active
partner, encouraging growth also through acquisitions.

For Clessidra, the integration of ESG criteria is a fundamental prerequisite for all investment deci-
sions. Since 2010, the SGR has adhered to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Invest-
ment (UN PRI). In December 2018, Clessidra also adopted a responsible investment policy which
defines the approach to managing environmental, social and governance aspects in the analysis
and processes of investment and divestment, in company policies and practices and in supporting
portfolio companies in implementing sustainability. In particular:

= in the pre-investment phase, Clessidra integrates the assessment of ESG issues through the
use of a proprietary checklist which is aligned with the international guidelines to perform a
