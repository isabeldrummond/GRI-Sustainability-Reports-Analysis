SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

RiSk
Management

The Enterprise Risk Management
(ERM) system at Manni Group con-
siders all areas of risk assessment
and management in respect of risks
connected to the business.

In addition to traditional risk cate-
gories, the Group’s ERM system dy-
namically extends the management
of new risks arising from changes in
the market, corporate structure, the
Group’s geographical structure and
governance, vesting Management
with significant powers.

Indeed, taking and managing risk
appropriately has become essential
in order to create value and profit
for shareholders. It is therefore nec-
essary to ensure a fair balance that
protects the company against poten-
tial losses and damage, while giving
leeway to Management to engage in
distributed entrepreneurship.

The ERM process starts from the
Governance in place at the Holding
company, where the extent of risk
tolerance is defined as a guiding el-
ement of the Risk Management plan.
The development of ERM activities,
which was extended to all industrial
Group companies, further led to the
adoption of a process-based Integrat-
ed Control Model, allowing all control
levels to be reorganised with a view
to integration, efficiency and quality.

One of the main responsibilities
of the Board of Directors is to ob-

tain assurance that the processes of
the organisation operate in accor-
dance with the metrics established
in pursuing the defined objectives.
Furthermore, management process
effectiveness must be achieved by
ensuring that the level of risk is con-
sistent with the assessments decid-
ed by the Board of Directors.

At least once a year, the Board of
Directors reviews the Group’s risk
tolerance and its management
framework, analysing the impact of
various scenarios and adopting the
relevant measures to ensure compli-
ance with the policies undertaken.

Thanks to the support of the BSO
function and by relying on a tai-
lor-made approach, the Group’s ERM
system will incorporate all the ESG
issues arising from the Materiality
Analysis at the end of 2019.

 

Certifications

Over the years, Manni Group has
paid special attention to ongo-
ing compliance with international
best practices and to the improve-
ment of the processes underlying
the management of both business
and sustainability risks. As a result,
group companies have progressive-
ly obtained certifications attesting
to the quality standards extended
to their employees, the market and
the community.

A process is underway within the
Group to standardise the manage-
ment systems and related certifi-
cations and to extend such certi-
fications to all the main areas. As
of 2020, Manni Group Spa will also
launch the process for certifying its
anti-corruption monitoring system
in accordance with ISO 37001 Stan-
dard. These further steps forward
show the innovative and at the
same time responsible nature of the
Group.
