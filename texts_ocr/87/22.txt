Manni Group’s — holistic and
cross-cutting approach to sus-
tainability is also reflected in the
management of the supply chain:
thanks to a focus on social and en-
vironmental variables, the company
has furthered development in the
countries where its production fa-
cilities are located.

The growing importance of sourc-
ing for the company’s businesses
has led the Group to consolidate
the purchasing policy development
plan, involving the main suppliers for
the five main categories of products
and services purchased:

> Steel

» Chemicals

+ Mineral wool

+ Independent contractors
> Transport

CORE PRODUCTS

Recent analyses of the life cycle of
the Group's products have shown
that cooperation between the vari-
ous players along the value chain is
a key enabler for achieving the sus-
tainability goals being pursued by
the Group.

More specifically, this analysis
showed that the consumption of pri-
mary resources and the impact on
climate change are supply chain fac-
tors that need to be mitigated in ad-
vance in order to limit their effects.

SOURCING POLICY

Being aware of the importance
of supplies, in 2017 Manni Group
launched a plan for the upgrading
of sourcing policies. The issues ad-
dressed during discussions with
suppliers for the development of
these sourcing policies relate to
circular economy, climate-altering
emissions, development. strategy,
innovation, management and certi-
fication systems, training, health and
safety, relations with local communi-
ties and risk management. This proj-
ect was reflected in the Sourcing Pol-
icy document, which was published
in the course of 2018. The text con-
tains the main principles on which
the Group’s development vision,
Code of Ethics and Sustainability
Policy are based, making sourcing
choices consistent with the evolu-
tion of corporate strategies. It also
incorporates the principles set out in
the United Nations Global Compact.

In the light of this Policy, the com-
pany and all the Group’s subsidiaries
will therefore undertake to integrate
the social and environmental vari-
able into supply chain management.

Core active suppliers

The integrated assessment process
allowed detailed information to be
collected from the main core suppli-
ers, accounting for more than 50% of
annual expenditure (2017 figure).

This is expected to gain momen-
tum in the coming years thanks,
among other things, to the imple-
mentation of online tools, together
with possible second party audits.
These tools focus on sharing infor-
mation concerning:

» Management and certification
systems

~ Corporate strategies

= Circular economy

> Airemissions

> Innovation

Training

Health and safety

Risk management

Ethics and the fight against

corruption
