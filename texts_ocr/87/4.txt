“Rule 22 - Aware of its being accountable

to current stakeholders as well as future
generations, the Group promotes a holistic and
cross-cutting approach to sustainability that
defines every aspect of its business, allowing

it to continue to grow and Strive in a fair and
sustainable manner, while relying on investments

development processes in accordance with the
Sustainability Guidelines set by the Holding
Company. The Business Sustainability Officer
(BSO) function is tasked with the drafting of

the action plan as required during the start-up
phase of the Business Sustainability Programme

Board of Directors of the Holding Company.
The BSO is responsible for performing the
above-mentioned audit”.

SOURCED FROM MANNI GROUP'S CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DOCUMENT

We focus on all aspects of sustain-
ability, comprising economic, social
and environmental issues. There-
fore, we look beyond these latter as-
pects, as we consider the economic
viability of business choices, which
underpin the survival and develop-
ment of the company in the long
term while ensuring the social inter-
actions of our activities.

Essentially, we have taken steps
both within and outside our com-
pany. This has led to the launch of a
plan aimed at reducing the environ-
mental impact and to the drafting
of guidelines for Management that
were set out in the Group’s Corporate
Governance document. Research
and Development endeavours also
got underway with a view to sup-
porting product and service innova-
tion by relying on materials that are
more natural, feature greater ther-
mal efficiency and comply with the
most stringent certifications, while
focusing on circular economy prac-
tices, which are part and innate of
our business.

In 2016 we therefore adopted our
Business Sustainability Programme,
a five-year programme that is up-
dated on an annual basis and is
driven by our Sustainability Policy.
The purpose of this programme is to
direct the Group towards a shared
management of environmental im-
pacts, the main ones being climate
change and resource use. This prin-
ciple is implemented by sharing the
approach reflected in the Sourcing
Policy with our suppliers and by in-
creasingly engaging all the Stake-

holders. We are qualifying our sup-
pliers, paying increasing attention
to the sustainability content of their
proposition and to their responsible
acting.

More and more standards and as-
sessment frameworks in the con-
struction business require infor-
mation and certifications on the
products and services offered, in-
cluding the impacts generated by the
activities of the entire supply chain.
Our long-standing organisational
set-up has enabled us to obtain cer-
tifications such as EPD (Environmen-
tal Product Declaration), innovative
labels such as Declare, GHG (Green
House Gases) emission inventories
verified and carried out in accor-
dance with ISO 14064:2019, which
are extended not only to direct emis-
sions (categories 1 and 2) but also to
indirect, supply chain-related, emis-
sions pertaining to haulage and the
production of the goods used.

During 2019 the Group non-finan-
cial disclosure was further improved
by extending the content of our
Group Sustainability Report accord-
ing to the GRI Standard Framework,
which is based on the principles of
accuracy, balance, clarity, compa-
rability, reliability and timeliness. A
materiality analysis was therefore
carried out to become cognizant of
and reflect the view of all Stakehold-
ers in company decisions.

Our 75-year long history bears
witness to the fact that developing
investments and relying on an or-
ganisation with a holistic, long-term
vision means making the company’s

LETTER FROM THE CEO

business sustainable. This is the es-
sence of the concept of Sustainabil-
ity. Indeed, today’s challenge is to
combine the speed of change and
the drive for continuous innovation
with long-term goals and _ invest-
ments.

We want to lead by example and
encourage those who have only just
begun to approach these issues,
because investing in Sustainabili-
ty makes a company more credible
and attractive, while significantly re-
ducing some risk areas and opening
up new scenarios and relations.

Wishing you an insightful reading,
