orientation

For the past 15 years, Manni Group
companies have been relying on a
function whose main focus is to de-
liver an increasingly accurate and
efficient service to its customers,
resulting in some interesting inno-
vations being introduced in the past
year:

» Streamlined production and ser-
vice organisation to ensure timely
delivery, including for small orders.

» Technical department’s increased
focus on customer orientation.

» Introduction of self-declared cer-
tifications regarding technical
product specifications.

» Internal newsletter to inform and
keep all staff up to date with the
latest technical and commercial
developments.

With a view to transparency, cus-
tomers are granted free access to
Manni Group’s plants for on-site in-
spections.

More specifically, the Panels BU has
implemented a technical prescrip-
tion and advisory service for custom-
ers having more specific needs with
a view to helping to chose the best
technical and application solution,
consistent with the objectives set
out by the customer.

 

6 / SUSTAINABILITY OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN

In 2019, the electronic version of
the customer satisfaction survey
was also introduced. The related
questionnaire gives some insights
into expectations, satisfaction with
the results achieved and provides
a comparison with the rest of the
market. It was administered as a first
test to 500 selected customers with-
in the Trevenzuolo plant operating
perimeter, with 34 replies expressing
appreciation for the quality of the
services and the variety of the Iso-
pan product range. It also showed
that the increasing need for flexibil-
ity expressed by the market. The sur-
vey will certainly be improved and
extended to other Isopan entities in
the coming years.

The service centres of the Steel BU
provide their customers with tech-
nical and commercial support with
professionally trained personnel
who also act as a service for logis-
tics aspects.

More generally, group companies
rely on customer service as their
strong point, with the considerable
organisational and management ef-
fort made also playing a role to this
end. Indeed, the recent upgrading of
IT systems was aimed at achieving
precisely this goal. The new SAP sys-
tem, which became fully operation-
al at Manni Sipre and Manni Inox in
2019 following a great effort in terms
of commitment and organisation,
and at Ilsopan Spa as of 2020, en-
sures accuracy, timeliness, reliabili-
ty, transparency and flexibility.
