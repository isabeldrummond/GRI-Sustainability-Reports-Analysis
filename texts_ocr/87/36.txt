Manni Group’s 2019 Sustainability
Report contains information on gov-
ernance, ethics, anti-corruption, en-
vironmental, social and anti-corrup-
tion issues and respect for human
rights, such information helping pro-
vide Stakeholders with a clear view
of the strategies, activities under-
taken and results achieved by the
Group in the pursuit of its economic
growth and business development,
while taking into account the expec-
tations of the Stakeholders involved
and with a view to continuous im-
provement.

This report represents Manni
Group's Disclosure prepared in
compliance with the Sustainability
Reporting Standards published in
2016 by the Global Reporting Initia-
tive - GRI (with “Core Option” ap-
plication level). It should be noted
that all reported GRI indicators refer
to the GRI Standards version pub-
lished in 2016, except for Indicator
403, which refers to the version pub-
lished in 2018. The activities carried
out in order to determine the con-
tents of the report are described in
chapter 2 of this document.

The previous report is included in
the Annual Report 2018, published

online at www.mannigroup.com in
May 2019.

3 / METHODOLOGICAL NOTE

REPORTING BOUNDARY

The information presented in this
document relates to the 14 Group
companies which alone contribute
almost entirely to the total consoli-
dated financial statements. Namely:

Commercial companies lsopan
Manni Group CZ, Isopan France and
Manni Green Tech USA were includ-
ed in the organisation chart and in
the map on page 10 to indicate their
presence in the territory. Financial
companies Panfin Srl, Gruppo Manni
Srland sub-holding company Isopan
International were only included in
the organisation chart, as they are
dedicated to the Group control. The
newly-acquired company Maetrics
Srl was only included in the organi-
sation chart to complete disclosure,
as the acquisition transaction was
completed in 2019 and, therefore,
only partial data and information
were available.

The impact of the companies not

included in the reporting boundary
was not significant for the purposes
of this Sustainability Report.
