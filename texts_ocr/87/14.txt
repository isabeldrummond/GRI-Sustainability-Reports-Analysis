SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Materiality
analysis and
materiality
matrix

Our active and constant dialogue
with the internal and external Stake-
holders — based on transparency
and trust values — led in 2019 to the
first Materiality Analysis, which was
completed using an online ques-
tionnaire in six languages distribut-
ed to over 12,000 contacts.

Materiality Analysis entails identi-
fying and assessing the priority of
all relevant issues (material topics),
i.e. the issues or topics that can in-
fluence the opinion and actions of
Stakeholders and, as a result, the
company’s ability to create lasting
and shared value.

Manni Group’s BSO (Business Sus-
tainability Officer) began to consider
conducting this analysis as early as
2018, when the annual report was
drafted. The objectives being pur-
sued by the BSO through this analy-
sis tool include:

» Providing the Board of Directors

with a guidance tool

» Providing useful information for

the definition of corporate and
sustainability strategies

» Aligning the annual report with in-
ternational standards

» Updating the Sustainability Policy
based on a process shared with
Stakeholders

» Analysing possible ESG risks (to-
gether with the Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) function)

» Considering ESG issues when
mapping risks (together with the
ERM function)

By relying on such a listening and
exchange process, the Group is able
to assess the extent to which it un-
derstands and meets the expecta-
tions and needs of its Stakeholders,
while identifying the areas where its
commitment must be increased and
those where the approach adopted
must be pursued.

1.
Identifying key issues

In order to identify the
Group’s key issues,

an initial analysis was
conducted on the
sustainability reports,
websites, governance
documents, policies,
codes of ethics and
supplier integrated
assessment in relation to
suppliers, competitors,
trade associations and
lending institutions. All
this information was
then integrated with the
analysis of international
standards and press review
concerning construction
and steel sectors.

Management and
Stakeholder engagement

By administering a six-
language questionnaire

to its stakeholders, Manni
Group assessed what
Stakeholders consider to be
important in their dealings
with group companies,

and what they consider to
be relevant to them. At the
same time, engagement

by the management of

the different Manni Group
companies was encouraged
by holding ad hoc meetings
and administering a
questionnaire, the purpose
being to highlight the
company’s needs.

Analysis of results
and materiality matrix

The process to determine
issue relevance was
carried out by performing
a statistical analysis

of the results of the
questionnaires submitted
by the stakeholders and
those submitted by the
Department Heads.

The topics that scored
less than 3.8 x 3.8 were
excluded from the
reporting scope because
they were considered of
little significance. The
final result is shown in
the following materiality
matrix.
