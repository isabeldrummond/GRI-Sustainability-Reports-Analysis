SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

Health and
Safety

The Group considers the preven-
tion of accidents, the protection of
the working environment and the
protection of its own employees
to be of strategic importance. On
the basis of this assumption, all
the companies manage this aspect
independently and in accordance
with the regulations in force in their
own country.

Due to its production character-
istics, Manni Sipre also relies on a
certified Management System. Since
2019, this system has been upgraded
from OHSAS 18001 to the more re-
cent UNI ISO 45001. All other Italian
companies base their management
system on the provisions of the Con-
solidated Act on Health and Safety at
Work (Legislative Decree 81/08).

The foreign Isopan companies take
into account system guidelines pro-
vided by parent company Isopan
Spa, adapting them to the different
national regulations.

100%

Employees covered by a health
and safety management system

The Group has defined a structure
of delegations and sub-delegations
pertaining to health and safety ac-
countability, the purpose being to
ensure timely supervision across all
different group companies.

In compliance with local regula-
tions, a periodic meeting is planned
with the participation of the Employ-
er, the Prevention and Protection
Service Manager, the Workers’ Safety
Representatives and the designated
occupational doctor.

Occupational health and _ safety
management systems are based on
risk assessment, to be conducted in
accordance with the regulations in
force, in which the designated phy-
sician and workers’ representatives
are involved. This assessment will
result in such mitigation and control
measures as necessary to ensure
the health and safety of workers.
Examples include training, health
surveillance, emergency manage-
ment procedures, technical process
instructions and technical safety in-
structions. More specifically:

Monitoring is extended to both
injuries and accidents as well as
near misses, i.e. near injuries and
near accidents; moreover, causes,
follow-ups and related actions are
identified by using specific mod-
ules and internal investigations;
Regular health surveillance is
guaranteed in accordance with lo-
cal regulations;

Health and safety training and
periodic refresher courses are
delivered in accordance with the
regulations;

» All the training phases are recorded
and, where necessary, employees
are issued a licence enabling them
to perform their job;

» The above-mentioned aspects are
submitted to Management on a
yearly basis for its review, togeth-
er with the specific training plan,
for the purpose of both complying
with legal requirements and deliv-
ering quality or optional refresher
courses. On that occasion, the an-
nual objectives for improvement
are also established.

The workers’ health not directly
related to the working environment
is also protected through company
welfare initiatives and healthcare
schemes aimed at facilitating per-
sonal health based on second-level
agreements, which are also covered
in chapter 6.2.

Human capital
training and
empowerment

Manni Group’s vision is based on
internationalisation, digitisation and
sustainability: three milestones that
can be reached through technolo-
gy and, more importantly, people.
The Group believes that personal
and corporate objectives should be
aligned at all times in relation to the
needs and expectations of the differ-
ent generations currently coexisting
and working within the company.

Strategically, therefore, the com-
pany’s Human Resources depart-
ment has resolved to integrate skills
and Personnel Administration and
Management systems with new
projects concerning people knowl-
edge, engagement, development,
satisfaction and performance. As a
result, personnel management tasks
have been enhanced to include
new knowledge and tools relating
to recruiting, training, internal com-
munication and the performance
management process, which was
officially launched in June 2019 for
all Manni Group, Manni Energy and
Manni Green Tech companies hav-
ing a service record in excess of 6
months.

Through this process, each manag-
er, having defined the Department

objectives, will now be able to inte-
grate quantifiable and measurable
result items with the observation of
direct reports’ behaviour, this being
a structured and objective activity
based on communication and con-
stant dialogue with direct reports.

Staff participating
in the Performance
Management project

Manni Group strongly believes in
lifelong learning, with the aim of pro-
viding continued training to its em-
ployees and collaborators, thereby
furthering the retention of an “active
working population” and supporting
employment.

Individual and group English, Span-
ish or German language courses are
also delivered to encourage interna-
tional collaboration between group
companies. Worth noting is also the
permanent refresher training service
of The European House Ambroset-
ti, addressed to 35 top and middle
managers. Its aim is to stimulate and
increase continued education and
networking through a programme
consisting of live meetings — distrib-
uted across Italy — and many live we-
binars. In addition, workshops and
global summits addressing a whole
range of topics are held, so that the
many refresher training needs may
be best fulfilled at all times.

4/HUMAN CAPITAL

During 2019, the Group also consol-
idated its partnership with the CUOA
Foundation, a Business School that
promotes training and the develop-
ment of managerial and entrepre-
neurial culture. Indeed, participation
in managerial training courses in the
Finance sector makes it possible to
bring added value within the Group
and to network with other entities
across the territory, encouraging
synergies and partnerships.

Total participation
in Ambrosetti events

The employees of Italian compa-
nies benefited from a total of 2,085
hours of training during 2019, i.e. an
average of about 3 hours per em-
ployee. This figure pertains solely
to training outside the company, to
which training hours delivered at the
workplace must be added. Specific
monitoring is being set up with re-
spect to the latter. The preparation
of this report has made it neces-
sary to extend the reporting scope
to the training received by employ-
ees. In this regard, the company has
planned to initate a specific process
to trace such information and to ex-
tend this approach to overseas com-
panies.
