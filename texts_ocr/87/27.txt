The fight
against climate
change

Manni Group is committed to the
fight against climate change. As a
preliminary step, the Group has in-
creased its focus on the emissions
for which its operating companies
are directly responsible, such emis-
sions being defined as scope 1 and
scope 2 under the GHG Protocol.
Following the publication of the
Sustainability Policy in 2016, a 15%
reduction target to be reached by
2021 was set for these emissions,
with the support of an energy effi-
ciency plan concerning the main

productive units, as described in
details in the previous chapter.

During 2019, following discus-
sions with the Scientific Committee
of the Science Based Target initia-
tive (SBTi), Manni Group revised its
emission reduction targets. Based
on guidance provided under the
new UNI EN ISO 14064:2019 Stan-
dard - Part 1, the Group’s inventory
of annual emissions was extended
to scopes 3 and 4 relating to up-
stream and downstream haulage
and the production of purchased
goods, which proved to be relevant
during the initial screening phase,
as they account for almost 99% of
total emissions, with the entire value
chain being included.

The new targets, much more am-
bitious and challenging than the
previous ones, take into account the

7 / ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

demands of the Paris agreements
and have already been fine-tuned
and approved by Management and
will be submitted for approval to the
Science Based Target in Paris during
2020 to be officially disclosed during
the same year.
