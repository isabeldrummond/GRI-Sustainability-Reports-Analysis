SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

 

Over the years, Manni Group has
supported multiculturalism by en-
couraging an open and stimulating
work environment, resulting from
exchanges between different back-
grounds and values. This sensitivity,
which proves to be crucial every day
also as part of the Group’s interna-
tionalisation experiences, has led to
support various humanitarian proj-
ects and solidarity endeavours. In
2019, this commitment resulted in a
total of € 60,000 worth of donations,
in addition to personal voluntary
work performed.

Areka, Ethiopia, to which the compa-
ny makes a significant contribution

ered by energy produced by a pho-
tovoltaic system donated by Manni
