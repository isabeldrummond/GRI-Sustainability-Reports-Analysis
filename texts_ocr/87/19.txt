Corporate
welfare

In addition to training, Manni
Group encourages reliance

on services that can contribute
to improving the quality of life
of workers.

Through second-level
negotiation, in July 2019 all
Group employees were given
the opportunity to access the
corporate welfare platform —
which the Services BU has been
accessing since 2018 — and
thus be able to take advantage
of a number of agreements.
These agreements make it
possible to benefit from facilities
on different categories of
services and products, ranging
from personal and family health
to education and training costs,
from leisure to travel, from
technology to fashion.

 

 

Ethics and
Values

Manni Group relies on a specific
organisational model for each com-
pany that complies with the local
standards of the countries where
group companies operate. In Italy,
this model is consistent with the di-
rectives of Legislative Decree 231/01,
on which the company’s Code of
Ethics is based, in order to prevent
misconduct and possible offences.
Already renewed in 2018 following
a participatory project course dedi-
cated to corporate ethics, the Code
applies to the entire workforce of
group companies. With this in mind,
the Ethics Committee was then es-
tablished with the tasked of oversee-
ing compliance with the principles
set out in the text. These values and
rules of conduct were developed by
the Ethics Committee itself and then
approved by the Board of Directors.

Other Committees were also estab-
lished, including several technical
and operational Committees whose
periodic meetings are monitored by
the Supervisory Board. The infor-
mation flows sent by these bodies
to the Supervisory Board make it
possible to provide the governing
bodies with relevant information on
environmental and social issues that
may arise, including Top Manage-
ment reviews of the management
systems implemented or mandatory
periodic meetings on safety.

All new members of Manni Group’s
governing body, employees who car-
ry out activities on behalf of the or-
ganisation as well as business part-
ners undergo specific training on a
regular basis regarding corporate re-
sponsibility, with the first cycle of les-
sons being held from 2011 to 2013,
while the second cycle — started in
2016 — was completed in 2019.

The Code of Ethics, translated into
all the languages of the countries in
which the Group operates, is deliv-
ered to each member of the compa-
ny's governing body, employees who
carry out activities on behalf of the
organisation and business partners,
urging them to read the document,
which is available on the corporate
website and, therefore, can also be
accessed by third parties.

At Manni Group, the Organisation-
al Model is managed through the
Cloud governance 2.0 system, which
makes it possible to analyse and
manage the risk of crime, assess the
risk of any sensitive activity, establish
non-compliance and require correc-
tive actions on the part of the pro-
cess owner, which are then assessed
by the Supervisory Board.

With regard to group companies,
in particular, 148 sensitive activities
potentially at risk of corruption are
monitored, out of a total of 292 op-
erations assessed and managed.
The most significant risks, identi-
fied during the relevant analysis,
pertain to political corruption and
bribery between private individuals.
In the former case, the risk of direct
crime was considered — within Man-
ni Group — as marginal, albeit the
Supervisory Board’s keeps a strong

focus on crimes committed by part-
ners or other company stakehold-
ers. As to bribery between private
individuals, the Supervisory Board
scrupulously monitors sales reps’
operations.

The independent Supervisory
Board has relations with the Board
of Statutory Auditors and the In-
dependent Auditors and receives
reports relating to any misconduct
(whistleblowing). It therefore per-
forms constant audits, based on
which quarterly reports are creat-
ed for each group company. The
Group’s foreign subsidiaries are also
subject to the same system, which
implements the regulations of the
respective countries.

The company's Management con-
siders environmental protection to

be an essential and priority objec-
tive: all production and service activ-
ities are therefore primarily aimed at
environmental compliance require-
ments.

Manni Group considers compliance
with environmental regulations as
the minimum but essential condi-
tion for the legitimacy of production
processes.

Manni Group is therefore commit-
ted to implementing and maintain-
ing an effective environmental man-
agement system at the production
site, while pursuing a policy of con-
tinuous improvement of its environ-
mental performance, allocating ad-
equate financial, technological and
professional resources. Likewise,
the Group endeavours to ensure
that its activities are carried out in

compliance with current legal require-
ments. More specifically, no breach of
environmental laws and regulations
are to be reported for 2019.
