Energy
Strategy

Bearing witness to Manni Group’s
focus on renewable energy sources
and energy efficiency is a Company
part of the Group which is entirely
dedicated to these issues: Manni En-
ergy. Since its establishment in 2011,
the company has been engaging in
providing design, maintenance and
energy efficiency services to cus-
tomers and consultancy to all group
companies.

The Group’s production plants are
mainly powered by electricity, while
in the case of the Isopan plants alone,
the consumption of natural gas as a
source of thermal energy is similar to
the consumption of electricity.

Other energy sources, albeit to a
much lesser extent, include Liquid
Petroleum Gas, diesel and fuel oil.

Through constant annual invest-
ments, all Italian plants have been
audited and are subject to continu-
ous consumption monitoring, with
the software of the newly acquired
company Maetrics also playing a role
to this end. They have also under-
gone continuous works of various
kind, some of which have reached
completion, while others are still un-
derway and are also being extended
to plants abroad, such as:

» Deployment of photovoltaic systems
» Installation of power quality systems
» Installation of inverters and of

electric motors

7 / ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

» Replacement of gas boilers with
high efficiency systems

» Lighting engineering installations

» Enhancement of compressed air
production and distribution pro-
cesses

The first energy audit was per-
formed on the Mozzecane site, in ac-
cordance with the requirements of
Legislative Decree 102/2014, and was
later repeated in 2019. Subsequent
audits were, on the other hand, per-
formed in 2017 on a voluntary basis
and involved all Italian sites.

The measures adopted resulted,
among other things, in 176 Energy
Efficiency Certificates being award-

ed in 2019.
