Structure

Manni Group holding company
manages shareholdings and coor-
dinates the Group, including by re-
lying on sub-holding companies.

The meetings of the Holding
company’s Board of Directors,
which meets at least every three
months, are a place where ideas are
shared, all the more so in today’s
fast-changing scenarios. In this
connection, the methods based on
which strategic decisions are made
are periodically reviewed and con-
trolled according to set patterns to
ensure their effectiveness over time.

By issuing a defined Corporate
Governance document, Manni
Group sets out a number of rules
on the key aspects that adjust the
Group’s governance as needs for ex-
ternal delegation — and, therefore,
the need to deal with risks — in-
crease, the underlying goal being to
ensure that autonomy and control
are appropriately balanced .

Supporting this delegation pro-
cess there is a qualified Audit Pro-
gramme and Risk Management
Department, specific training plans
also for new employees in order to
guarantee responsibility and au-
tonomy. The system of delegations,
policies and internal procedures
was reorganised in 2019. The Board
of Directors of the holding company
also sets out to provide company
stakeholders with a clear vision of a
fair and responsible business.

3 / CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Board of Directors of the
Holding Company includes repre-
sentatives of business owners and
independent members. The Board
of Directors of the Group boasts a
whole range of high and wide-rang-
ing skills, as it strongly believes that
a qualified leadership at the helm of
the holding company, together with
the management expertise of its
subsidiaries, will generate value.

The tasks and structure of the Su-
pervisory Board are described in a
dedicated chapter on page 36.

In the pursuit of its international-
isation effort and in the light of the
management complexity of its geo-
graphical distribution, the Group de-
cided to extend Governance to all its
foreign subsidiaries.
