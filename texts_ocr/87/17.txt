SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

 

Manni Group views the people who
work every day with dedication and
passion as a company strategic as-
set. Their knowledge and skills un-
derpin the Group’s ability to inno-
vate and pursue excellence. Aware
of the key role played by its people,
Manni Group is constantly commit-
ted to instilling a sense of belonging
and motivation in all those who work
for the company.

Recognising people and their di-
versity as a value and an asset will,
externally, feed into a commitment
to becoming acquainted with and
taking into account the needs of lo-
cal communities and, internally, to
ensuring equal opportunities and
parenting by encouraging the dis-
semination of welfare policies and a
fair work-life balance.

The company also strives to devel-
op the skills of its employees to sup-
port their professional and cultural
development, promoting lifelong
learning and continued training with
a view to creating a safe, healthy and
sustainable working environment.

Looking to the future is also of par-
amount importance. To this end,
Manni Group supports the partici-
pation of younger generations in the
workplace, cultivating and enhanc-
ing their skills.

The internationalisation project
promoted within Manni Group also
continued to gain momentum, with
colleagues from different companies
exchanging and sharing professional
skills and experiences. This is an op-
portunity that allows employees to
pursue careers in other Group loca-
tions, both in Italy and abroad.

All these endeavours, which are
crucial to the company’s develop-
ment goals, are implemented by
Manni Group with a view to ensur-
ing a constant exchange between
employees and associates, so as to
allow them to grow and develop in
a healthy and stimulating working
environment.
