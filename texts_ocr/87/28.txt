A Circular
Business

By deploying initiatives based on
the Circular Economy model, Manni
Group is committed to increasing
the use of recyclable materials and
reducing its waste production.

Steel, a core element of Manni
Group’s business, abides by and re-
flects the principles of this econo-
my, as its characteristics allow it to
be remelted and reused many times
without its physical properties being
affected.

86% of the weight of the total waste
produced by the Group’s companies
consists of steel scrap, which then
undergoes a reselling and recycling
process in order to be eventually re-
sold on the market. In any case, over
91% of the waste produced

was set aside for recovery.

Finally, less than 1% is considered
as hazardous waste (this figure re-
flects an estimate, in that it also in-
cludes information from Mexico and
Russia, where different legislations
require a reclassification of hazard-
ous classes to ensure consistency
with the European classification,
which is used as a reference).

The focus on resource consump-
tion during the purchasing process
— while monitoring the recycled
content of the materials supplied
and subsequently used in the man-
ufacturing process — is yet another
virtuous example of how the Group
adopts an attitude geared towards

the circular economy model. Recy-
cled content — i.e. the weight per-
centage of secondary raw material
used for the production of goods —
is governed by specific requirements
in the construction industry. Indeed,
the most stringent international cer-
tifications for building sustainability
(LEED and BREEAM) as well as cer-
tain law and regulations applicable
to public procurement (NAP GPP
Minimum Environmental Criteria for
construction), require designers to
monitor and use a certain percent-
age of components made of recy-
cled material.

In 2019, Manni Group purchased
432,000 tons of steel and holds cer-
tificates on the recycled content,
issued by suppliers in accordance
with ISO 14021, which covers 79% of
them. It should be noted that some
suppliers only use scrap as raw ma-
terial for their production, with a
100% recycled content. The average
recycled material content of steel or-
dered by Manni Group in 2019 stood
at 49%.

The same analysis was extended to
13.2 thousand tons of mineral wool
ordered. More than 9,200 tons were
certified and more than 2,900 tons
came from both pre and post con-
sumer recycled mineral wool.

The average percentage of certified
recycled content stood at 32%, while
the average recycled content on to-
tal orders stood at 22%.

During 2019, discussions held with
a number of partners in the chemical
industry highlighted that this indus-
try is geared towards lower environ-
mental impact chemicals based on
strong circularity-oriented practices.

Partners have led to the production
of panels using raw polyols from raw
materials of organic origin and with
recycled content. It should also be
noted seen that these are already
becoming common practices that
Manni Group sets out to promote
and support.

LCA E EPD: LIFE CYCLE
ANALYSIS

The use of Life Cycle Analysis to
perform an objective assessment
of the impacts generated on the
environment along the entire value
chain of the Group’s products was
first introduced at Manni Group in
2012, thanks to the cooperation
with the European Association for
Panels and Profiles (PPA-Europe)
in the production of the 2 EPDs for
polyurethane foam and mineral
wool insulated panels.

These certificates were then re-
newed in 2018, also thanks to
the contribution provided by Iso-

7 / ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

pan-Deutschland, with reference
being made to the Product Category
Rules issued by the Institut Bauen
und Umwelt (|.B.U.) and to the LCA
study developed by Thinkstep.
During the same year, Isopan Spa
started its own internal LCA process
in relation to the first productions
on the Italian territory, which led to
he publication of 2 EPD certificates
during 2019. These certificates relate
0 the life cycle of not less than 27
products included in Isopan's cata-
ogue and were published thanks to
he support of EPD International.
Available at www.environdec.com.
Manni Group plans to extend re-
iance on this analysis to all global
productions, thanks to the new EPD
Process system required under ISO
14025 update. Indeed, the Group
believes that this type of certifica-
ion and the ability to generate it
can prove a key driver for the cre-
ation of alow environmental impact
construction industry, enabling cus-
tomers to operate in new markets
with ease.
