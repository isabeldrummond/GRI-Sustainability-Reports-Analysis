SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

results

The results for 2019 showed virtu-
ally no change in the Group’s posi-
tions, with a slight drop in volumes
and turnover, this also being due to
a drop in raw material prices, de-
spite the slowdown in growth in all
international markets that began in
2018.

There was an increase in markets
and international customers served,
consistent with the company vision,
according to which Internationali-
sation is viewed as one of the three
key drivers for development. The
share of customers to whom highly
qualified services and products are
provided also increased, compared
to the distribution of standard prod-
ucts.

Today, the Group offers its products
and services in 81 countries through
all its Business Units.

The Group’s aggregate turnover in
2019 exceeded € 603 million, show-
ing a 4% drop over the previous year
(€ 630 million). The positive trend
in investments continued, which in
2019 stood at € 14.4 million, up 17%
compared to 2018.

2019 also saw an increase in the
number of employees directly em-
ployed, standing at 1,156 as at 31
December 2019, reflecting the up-
trend in the organisation’s interna-
tional development, research and

development endeavours and new
services in which the Group has in-
vested, with special reference to the
innovation of sustainable products
and building systems.

Despite geopolitical tensions and
the widespread trade protection-
ism that affected commodity prices,
EBITDA of the Steel and Panels Busi-
ness Units proved positive, albeit
stable, standing at € 20.6 million.

Capital and financial ratios showed
an increase and a consolidation of
Net Asset Value, while the net finan-
cial position increased to underpin
investments, even though it proved
to be well-balanced thanks to the
optimisation of the Group’s cash po-
sition.

The strategies adopted for the de-
velopment of the Italian and inter-
national markets — which are wit-
nessing a strong integration of the
products and services offered by
group companies — displayed en-
couraging signs, leading to believe
that the positive growth trend can
be maintained.

The closely monitored organisa-
tion of our companies, coupled with
our focus on innovation and sustain-
ability, allow us to reach a growing
number of sectors and increase cus-
tomer loyalty, while ensuring service
continuity also in the challenging
scenarios affecting the economy
and society at large following the di-
rect and indirect effects arising from
the shock that hit us all at the begin-
ning of 2020.
