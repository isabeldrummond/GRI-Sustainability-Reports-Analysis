Manni Group's
development
drivers

Manni Group’s forward-looking
vision, based on skills and values
acquired during its 75-year old busi-
ness history, rests on three closely
interwoven drivers:

Innovation
Sustainability
Internationalisation

They are considered as medium/
long-term assets, the results of
which can most undoubtedly bene-
fit all of the Group's Business Units.

Internationalisation allows the
Group to diversify its activities at a
geographical level, spreading risk
and investment across European
and non-European markets. More-
over, the challenge posed by differ-
ent cultural contexts enables the
organisation and its employees to
grow and develop skills within an in-
ternational environment.

Innovation allows Manni Group to
respond to the new market needs
and improve production process-
es, making them increasingly effi-
cient and effective while involving a
low environmental impact, offering
high-added-value products.

To this end, the creation of the Re-
search and Development division re-
flects the will to explore new avenues
thanks to technology, consistent with
product and system innovation proj-

and digitisation principles.

Manni Group considers sustain-
ability as a way of doing business,
an approach enabling long-term
development in harmony with the
environmental and social context
in which the company operates.
Steel and the construction market,
to which Manni Group has always
linked its name — together with the
mechanics and plant engineering
sectors — allow a practical contribu-
tion to be made to the fight against
climate change and to the transi-
tion to a circular economy model,
in which business partners are also
involved. As a steel-industry group,
we feel duty-bound to reduce the
impact of the construction business
on the planet and to contribute to
the promotion of alternative con-
struction systems.

Since 2016, Manni Group has in-
cluded sustainability in its Gover-
nance system. Manni Group has
adopted a Sustainability Policy that
requires the establishment of a Busi-
ness Sustainability Officer function
reporting directly to the CEO of the
Holding Company. The policy re-
flects the concept of sustainability
in governance-related documents,
with reliance being made on the
annual report as a way to reach
the stakeholders and report on its
actions. By adopting a Sustainabil-
ity Policy, the Group also pursues
