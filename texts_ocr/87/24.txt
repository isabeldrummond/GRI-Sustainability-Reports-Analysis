Declare.

sopan’s special products are the
irst in Italy to have obtained the
DECLARE label in March 2019.
Thanks to Leaf and Green Roof,
sopan has been awarded the
abel for the transparency of
construction materials.

Declare is the label created by
he International Living Future
nstitute (ILFI) that certifies

he safety of materials used

in products intended for the
construction market.

Each product bearing the Declare
abel declares that it does not
contain “ingredients” that are

on the Red List, i.e. the list of the
most hazardous materials in the
construction industry.

 

Sustainable
building

Dry construction systems feature
a reliable method for construct-
ing safe, high-performing buildings
based on definite deadlines and
costs. Over the last 10 years, Italy has
witnessed a growing interest in this
kind of construction, hallmarked by
fast turnaround times, lower envi-
ronmental impact, earthquake and
fire safety, energy efficiency, acous-
tic comfort.

Manni Group plays a leading role
in this sector as it relies on steel, the
ideal material for this type of build-
ings, which the Group still considers
to be a key area for its operations.

Dry construction techniques are
well suited to being industrialised.
Indeed, building components are
not made on construction sites but
using industrial techniques and
technologies rather, and are then
hauled and assembled on site. This
method is known as “off-site”.

Since significantly less operations
are required to be carried out on
construction sites compared to tra-
ditional construction methods, op-
erators’ safety will also benefit from
a dry construction approach. More
details about aspects related to
modern construction methods can

“The construction industry in Europe

uses about 36% of energy, accounts
for about 40% of annual CO2
emissions, is responsible for 50% of
raw material extraction and 1/3rd
of drinking water consumption. As
a result, the construction industry
is not only a driving force behind
global economy, considering that it
involves 18 million jobs in Europe
alone, but it also plays a key role in
achieving the climate objectives set
out in the Paris agreements”.
