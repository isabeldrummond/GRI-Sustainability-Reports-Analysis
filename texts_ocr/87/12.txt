On 25 September 2015, the United
Nations approved the Agenda 2030
for Sustainable Development and its
17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), consisting of 169 targets to
be achieved by 2030. The imple-
mentation of the Agenda requires a
strong involvement from all parts of
society, from businesses to the pub-
lic sector, from civil society to philan-
thropic institutions, from universities
and research centres to information
and culture professionals.

Manni Group has reduced its
Green House Gases emissions by
20% in absolute terms over the
past 4 years and intends to pursue
further challenging reduction
milestones in the future.

Operating in the steel sector and
influencing a supply chain consisting of
over 270 suppliers of raw materials and

semi-finished products, Manni Group
supports responsible circular economy,
production and consumption practices.

Research and
Development

In 2018, the Manni Group Research
and Development (R&D) Division
was established, with the aim

of addressing some of the main
sustainability issues in terms of
statics, earthquake-proofing, fire
protection, environment, while
paying attention to the aesthetic
functional and architectural impact
of group products. The R&D Division
has so far enabled all Group
companies to innovate products
and processes. An example of this is
to be found in the Leaf technology,
developed for the Isopan panels,
ensuring a significant improvement
in the thermal performance of
buildings and using halogen-free
flame retardants (www. isopan.it/
leaf). Another example is provided
by the Green Roof solution intended
for green roofs, designed in
partnership with Daku.*

Manni Group believes in open
innovation. This is why synergy
with strategic partners, aimed

at combining expertise and
know-how in products and
solutions, is considered to be a
fundamental aspect. With this in
mind, the company has started
cooperating with some of the most
important Italian universities,
including Padua University, Milan
Polytechnic, Federico II University
in Naples, Trieste University and
Verona University, as well as the
Technological Research Centre in
Rovereto.

In addition, the company
participates in specific innovative
construction projects funded by the
European Union, such as Step-Up
and Rezbuild**. The aim of the
StepUP innovation project is to
develop a “Plug & Play” system
capable of combining the “passive”
component (envelope) with the
“active” component, related to the
plants and to the production and
storage of energy, to be used to

Rezbuild project, on the other hand,
is essentially aimed at creating a
collaborative renovation ecosystem
focused on the stock of existing
residential buildings, using the
Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB)
