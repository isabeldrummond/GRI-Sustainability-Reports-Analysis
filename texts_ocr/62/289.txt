A minimum number of sustainability criteria for choosing suppliers were established for each area, based
on the amount and importance of the tender (if it is a tender with a significant impact on the environment,
occupational safety, the quality of services provided to customers, the term or amount of the contract).
Among the main criteria, mention is made of: the management of atmospheric emissions and sound,
prevention, reuse and recyclability of waste; energy efficiency; reduction of the hazardous nature of
substances used and reduction of water consumption (for the environmental protection criterion),
supplier's adoption of their own Code of Ethics; hiring of persons with disabilities and persons facing
hardship; accident prevention and safety training (the social commitment criterion); quality of materials,
equipment and instruments; professional qualifications and skills and technical services and performance.

The Procurement and Tenders functions are responsible for selecting the sustainability criteria in
agreement with the company contacts concerned. They chose the criteria to be used for the type of tender,
the importance of the sustainability criterion in relation to said tender, and assessments of previous
tenders assigned and their results. The Procurement and Tenders functions can also use the technical
support of the Shared Value and Sustainability Department and the Quality, Safety and Environment
Department for the choice of the criteria and the assessment of bids in the tender phase.

The New Tender Code, published by means of Italian Legislative Decree No. 50/2016 and which came into
force as from April 2016, assimilating the EU directives issued on the subject and establishing the new
regulations to be applied to tenders and public contracts, as subsequently amended by means of Italian
Legislative Decree No. 56/2017, envisaged the publication of around 50 measures including general
guidelines proposed by ANAC and ministerial decrees implementing the new rules introduced. The main
innovations of the New Code include the provision of the awarding method according to the economically
most advantageous bid approach as mandatory and exclusive in certain cases (Art. 95) such as for
example services with a high intensity of manpower (such as cleaning services or scholastic services), or in
engineering, architecture services or those of another technical or intellectual nature for amounts greater
than Euro 40 thousand.

The Hera Group Procurement guidelines in fact anticipated these virtuous practices in the selection of the
suppliers by around 10 years.
