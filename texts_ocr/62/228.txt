The cost of the waste management service

Hera has lower costs than the rest of Italy, also considering the cost per tonne of waste treated: 23% less
than of the Italian average and 12% less than that of northern Italy (Source: Ispra, 2018 Municipal Waste
Report, 2017 data). This result is also due to the higher amount of the waste of non-residential customers
being similar to municipal waste, which allows the fixed costs of the service to be spread over a higher
quantity of waste.
