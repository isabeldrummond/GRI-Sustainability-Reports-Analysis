CSV Investments

More geothermal for district heating

In Ferrara, we are in the process of
acquiring operation of geothermal wells
and we plan to increase their use also for
production activities that use energy at
low temperatures (e.g. greenhouses). The
expected increase of volume served by
2022 is 16%.

Ferrara, with its 2018 results, would pass
Trento, first in Italy in 2017 with 82%.
