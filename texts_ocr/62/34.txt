time. This ease of control increases awareness and reduces waste, both by decreasing the temperature set
during certain time ranges and by optimising the on/off cycles of the system that were previously needed
to keep the desired indoor temperature. Research shows that a 1 °C temperature reduction in a house
leads to saving between 5% and 10% of gas during the winter season (Source: Enea).

Hera ContaWatt is the option that helps residential and business customers monitor their electricity
consumption: the easy-to-install device connects to the electricity meter via a sensor and makes it possible,
using a dedicated app, to check electricity consumption from mobile devices or PCs. A summary with
consumption details is also sent by email every week. The ContaWatt independently connects to a data
transfer platform, can send real-time anomaly alerts to the app or via email and installation does not
require specialists.

In 2018, customers with Energy Efficiency Services accounted for 14.6% of the total. The data includes the
consumption analysis report, Hera LED, Hera ContaWatt and Hera Thermo. The decrease in the 2018 data
compared to the previous year is due to a change in how the consumption analysis report is disseminated
(which represents the most significant share of contracts with energy efficiency services). Until 2017, only
customers who chose the Nuova Idea Hera rate plan received this report, without having to specifically
request it. From 2018, all customers can have the analysis, regardless of their type of offer, but only by
requesting it. This change reduced the number of customers with consumption analysis reports, but made
them more aware of energy efficiency matters.

This reduction was partly offset by the increase in customers with other energy efficiency services (+6,000
contracts in 2018 compared to the previous year).

Spreading renewable energy

Electricity and thermal energy production plants from renewable sources

Herambiente produces heat and electricity from the combustion of waste, in its ten waste-to-energy plants
with a total installed electrical capacity of over 120 MW. Nine of these waste-to-energy plants are
dedicated to municipal waste and, as described in greater detail below, the energy they produce is
considered to be 51% renewable (biodegradable share of waste treated). Three of these waste-to-energy
plants, moreover, recover thermal energy to supply district heating networks. The Ferrara district heating
network, in addition to recovering heat from the waste-to-energy plant, also uses geothermal energy
drawn from the wells in Casaglia which is, in fact, its main source.

Herambiente owns the biodigesters at Ca’ Baldacci (RN), Voltana di Lugo (RA) and Cesena, each with a
capacity of 1 MW. In addition, the biogas exploitation plants at 9 landfills are still active, as is the biomass
plant operated in Faenza by Enomondo, in which Herambiente has a 50% stake.

The plants for recovering energy from purification sludge (biogas) in Bologna, Cesena, Forli and Savignano
sul Rubicone (FC) are also part of the integrated water system.
