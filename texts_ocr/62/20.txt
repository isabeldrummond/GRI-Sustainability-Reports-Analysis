“Shared value” EBITDA growth 2018-22

The 2018-2022 Group Business Plan targets a 2022 “shared value” EBITDA exceeding Euro 470 million,
equal to +43% increase compared to 2017, reaching 40% of the Group’s overall EBITDA.

The approximately 150 million increase during the time interval of the plan compared to 2017, equal to a
3/4 increase in the Group’s 2022 overall margins, derives mainly from the development of activities in the
CSV drivers: “smart use of energy” (Euro +59 million), “efficient use of resources” (Euro +64 million) and
“innovation and contribution to development of the area” (Euro +27 million).
