Considering equal consumption, the electricity bill of a residential customer to which the service subject to
the highest protection is applied increased by about 6% in 2018 compared to the previous year (Euro
29.68). The energy share increased by Euro 27.31, due to an increase in the cost of raw materials, partly
offset by a decrease in dispatching charges of Euro 4.93 and an increase in the sales quota of Euro 6.7 due
to an increase in the PPE (Energy Equalization Price) component; this component ensures that the total
amounts paid each quarter by customers served under market tariff protection conditions with the
generation and dispatching components match the purchase and dispatching costs actually incurred to
supply them with energy, and of system costs, which have been structurally modified since January 2018
and which decreased by Euro 1.53. Only the distribution quota and part of the sales quota are paid to Hera
for coverage of the management and maintenance costs of the power grid incurred by the distributor Hera
SpA and of the costs for sales activities (invoicing, bill sending, etc.) which are incurred by the Hera Comm
sales company. This portion accounts for 28% of the total bill.

The 2018 bill is calculated by using the twin rate tariff and the profile type defined by ARERA (one third of
consumption in the peak period, from 8 am to 7 pm from Monday to Friday, and two-thirds during off-peak
periods), which causes no difference between the twin rate and single rate prices.

The electricity bills include the following costs: sales costs, costs incurred to purchase energy and for the
dispatching service, which ensures a balance between electricity supply and demand at all times, costs to
cover the service for transporting electricity on the national transmission and local distribution grids
through to the meter (transport, distribution and metering costs and system charges), and taxes;

In January 2016, implementing European Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, in resolution
582/2015/R/eel, ARERA defined a programmatic framework to implement the reform of network tariffs
and tariff components to cover general system charges for residential customers. The Directive requires
gradual adjustment of the tariff components to the costs of the service involved. The adjustment of the
charging structure must be such as to stimulate virtuous behaviour by the residents and encourage
achieving energy efficiency objectives. The Reform is designed to be carried out in several steps. The fees
for network services (transmission, distribution and metering), were redefined starting 1 January 2016 to
mitigate the effect of progressiveness on consumption (first step), while from 1 January 2017 (second step)
the definitive non progressive tariff structure called “TD” was adopted, consisting of network services fees
that are the same for all residential customers and that are compliant with the criterion of consistency of
the tariffs with the costs of the underlying services. The fees for general system charges were redefined
from 1 January 2017 to mitigate the effect of progressiveness on consumption and to limit the number of
annual consumption brackets to two, and a fee expressed in Euro/year was introduced for non-resident
residential customers only. The completion of the process (third step), initially scheduled for January 2018,
was postponed by two years (initially by Resolution 867/2017/R/eel and then by Resolution
626/2018/R/eel) and sets 1 January 2020 for the reform to be operational, applying also to system charges
a tariff structure that is not progressive but rather differentiated between resident customers (to whom
they will be fully applied as energy-related charges) and non-resident customers (to whom they will be
applied partly as a fixed quota and partly as an energy-related charge).

Among the system charges, the highest cost component for final customers (equal to 77.6% of overall
system charges) promotes the production of energy from renewable and similar sources through an
incentive system which ensures definite compensation for the energy produced and special conditions for
connecting the plants to the networks. This component has constantly increased over the past years,
following the increase in production from renewable sources and the costs for adapting the network to
these sources.

For payments of electronic bills using direct debit, resolution 610/2015/R/COM introduced a bonus for

customers entitled to protective economic conditions, worth Euro 6 in 2018.

Hera Comm also informs residential customers of the advantages of its free market rate plans by providing

a comparative sheet with an estimate of what the customer is likely to pay according to the economic

conditions of the tariff protection conditions service defined by ARERA. The comparative sheets are drafted
