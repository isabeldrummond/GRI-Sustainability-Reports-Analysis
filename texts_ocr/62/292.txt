The Group sets itself the objective of continuing to show preference, in place of the largest discount, for
the economically most advantageous bid and to assign a relevant score to the environmental and social
sustainabi aspects in the tenders held with this method.

 

Within the ISO 50001 certification process for Hera SpA a clause was envisaged in the standard
specifications which obliges the technical contact individual - if they detect that the subject matter of the
purchase has a significant impact on the energy consumption of the Group - to proceed with the
assessment of the energy efficiency requirements on the basis of an Energy Management document useful
for the assessment of the energy impact.

In the private tenders the Hera Group, excluding Marche Multiservizi, invited an average of 21 suppliers for
each set of negotiations (weighted average on purchase volumes) confirming the approach of the Group
based on an open and transparent competition between the suppliers on a consistent basis with the
guidelines of current legislation.

With regard to the importance and significance assigned to sustainability criteria when assessing the bids,
the following tenders awarded in 2018 are indicated:
