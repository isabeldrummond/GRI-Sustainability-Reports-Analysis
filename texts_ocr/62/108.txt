Smart city: Smart drop-off point

The aim of the project is to create a technological infrastructure to gather the services for the city in a
single point, with a view to optimising energy, environmental, economic and IT resources. The services
envisaged include municipal waste collection with user identification, environmental quality monitoring,
video surveillance, telecommunication services and electrical charging.

The main innovative aspects of the project are:
e urban quality, by creating a point that gathers together and provides city services;
¢ monitoring of the main environmental parameters to check the city’s health levels;
¢ communication, through Wi-Fi hotspots, data concentrators and other telecommunication
equipment;
e sustainable transport, by developing a city network of charging stations for vehicles and bicycles.
e security, using a video surveillance and video analysis system;
