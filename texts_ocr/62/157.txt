and fauna (“Habitats Directive”). These directives created a consistent ecological network of protected
areas in the European Union, known as Natura 2000.

In the province of Ferrara, the two largest water collection plants, Pontelagoscuro and Stellata, on the Po
river, are located within the Special Protection Area called “Fiume Po da Stellata a Mesola e Cavo
Napoleonico”. In the province of Ravenna, the Marina di Ravenna treatment plant is located within the EU
Conservation Area “Piallassa Piombone” and discharges the treated wastewater into the “Piallassa
Baiona” special protection area.

At these two plants, in order to protect biodiversity, Hera Group carries out acute toxicity tests on the
purification plants.

Spreading innovation and digitalization
Social innovation: The Heureka+ Project

Heureka+, launched at the end of 2016, is a social innovation platform in which all employees can submit
their innovative proposals and also jointly develop an idea with their colleagues, contribute to ideas or vote
on the proposals of others. The Heureka+ platform permits direct and immediate interaction among
employees to contribute to the Group’s development and innovation.

To fine-tune the focus of the proposals, the Heureka+ platform has been organised into areas or
“challenges”. During 2018, 3 challenges were launched, for which a total of 39 ideas were proposed:
e the first challenge was on health and safety (18 ideas);
e the second challenge was diversity management as a corporate ambassador of inclusive culture (5
ideas);
e the third challenge was the opportunity to offer new services to citizens in the field of waste
management services (16 ideas).

Among the ideas received during previous editions and challenges, including those listed above, several
ideas were implemented in 2018:
e Car sharing app: a web application similar to Blablacar for publishing or viewing car sharing
opportunities between Hera locations;
© Office 365 in the Cloud: installation of Office 365 to manage email in the cloud;
e@ = Smart working: possibility to work at a location other than the assigned one, for one day a week;
e Heracover: making covers for mobile phones with environmentally sustainable materials;
e¢ ~=Mrillumino di Led: the improvement of outdoor lighting with the use of LED technology;
¢ Circular economy applied to a public lighting system, to measure the economic and metric
circularity of public lighting systems.

In addition, the following proposals are currently being implemented:
e Change the ending in the office: increasing separate waste collection in Hera’s offices;
e Hera without paper jams: competitions among Departments to reduce the quantity of prints and
photocopies;
e Fast & Suistainable: competitions among organisational units to reduce the use of the most
polluting fuel in the company fleet;
e Be safe drive smart: integrated systems to reduce smartphone use when driving.

Further challenges and improved functions of the Heureka+ platform will be launched during 2019.
