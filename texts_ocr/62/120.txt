Acantho’s role in the digitalization of the territory and the Hera Group

Acantho is the digital company of the Hera Group that serves the main cities of Emilia-Romagna and
Triveneto with a proprietary fibre optic network approximately 4,200 km long. The company has been
developing an ultra-broadband fibre-optic network for more than 15 years, on which it offers next-
generation telecommunications services. The Data Centres in Imola and Milan offer cloud services to our
customers, providing high levels of service quality and data security.

Among the main services offered:

* connectivity services up to 10 Gigabits per second;

e virtual private grid services;

e voice services and virtual switchboard;

e video presence services:

e video analysis and video surveillance services;

e Data Centre services (housing, virtual server, virtual Data Centre, storage and backup, business
continuity and disaster recovery).

Together with the Hera Group, Acantho also offers services for local Smart Cities, such as public Wi-Fi
services, smart security systems and digital signage. The latter are multifunctional totems (digital signage),
located near points of sale or public spaces, and which show users information or promotional content.

In 2017-2018 Acantho upgraded and extended the public Wi-Fi service for the city of Ravenna by installing
42 Wi-Fi oases, 6 of which are at UNESCO sites, and a total of 78 access points that enable free high-speed
connectivity service for residents, tourists and businesses.

With particular reference to business customers, the connectivity services offered are based on fibre optic
technologies, radio links and copper. The objective for the future is specifically to increase the number of
customers connected to optical fibre, compared to copper technologies, also thanks to the integration with
other operators (regional and national).

The Italian Ultra Broadband Network Strategic Plan has set specific objectives for 2020 and the
implementation of the strategy is coordinated by the Ministry of Economic Development (MiSE) as follows:
© Coverage at least 100 Megabits per second for up to 85% of the population;

e Coverage at least 30 Megabits per second for the remaining population;

e At least 100 Megabits per second coverage for public buildings (schools, hospitals, etc.), areas of major
economic interest and population concentration, industrial areas, major tourist destinations and
logistics hubs.

With its fibre optics, Acantho can provide ultra-wideband connectivity (with connection speeds of up to 10

Gigabits per second) to 14,571 companies out of the 28,283 surveyed in its service area, thus covering 52%

of them.

The expression “digital divide“ indicates uneven distribution in the access to information and
communication technologies between districts or areas, both in terms of public infrastructure and private
equipment. “Digital divide” is synonymous with technological backwardness and in particular indicates the
lack (or slowness) of the connection to the web.

Acantho participates, through a formal expression of interest, in the integration of other operators’ fibre-
optic networks in order to reach, with its own commercial services, business users based in areas of digital
divide.

In 2018, Acantho extended its commercial coverage to 10 new areas in digital divide in the municipalities of
Bologna, Ferrara, Forli-Cesena and Ravenna, by showing interest in another regional operator with positive
results.

Acantho is also involved in many projects for the Hera’s digitalization, including: cassONetto Smarty; Smart
drop-off point; Smart Metering and Smart Grid; Queue Management (HeraComm branch offices); Hera
Meal Vouchers Management; Hera physical security and building automation.
