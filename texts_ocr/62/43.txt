Considering the emissions produced by the electricity and heat plants shown in the table, the carbon
footprint of energy production in 2018 was 482 kg/MWh, down 16% compared to the 2015 baseline and
down compared to 2017 (-3.1%) due to lower emissions: (i) from landfills, which were affected by a
decrease in use for disposal of municipal waste; (ii) from waste-to-energy plants, as a result of lower energy
production; (iii) from plants serving district heating, due to lower electricity production of the cogeneration
plants, in particular that of Imola Casalegno (compared both to 2017 and to the forecasts for 2018).

The carbon footprint values for energy production were recalculated in 2018 to include: (i) emissions from
the F3 industrial waste-to-energy plant in Ravenna, (ii) emissions from the combustion of biogas in
biodigesters and purification plants for the production of electricity, and (iii) the energy produced by
district heating power plants. The values for 2015-2017 shown in the table are therefore pro-forma. The
carbon footprint for energy production calculated for the year 2018 on a like-for-like basis published in the
previous Report was 527 t/kWh, stable compared to 2017.

The measures already in place and those planned by the Hera Group will enable us to further reduce the
carbon footprint of our energy production in the years to come. By 2022, we expect to decrease the carbon
footprint of our energy production by 23% (442 kg of CO2/MWh) compared to 2015, mainly by producing
biomethane from organic waste and as a result of further decreasing the use of landfills to treat municipal
waste.

The EU-ETS (European Union Emission Trading System) sets a cap on the total level of emissions allowed to
all participants in the scheme, but it also allows them to trade emission quotas on the market according to
their needs. The Hera Group has 9 plants that are authorized to emit greenhouse gases on the basis of
Emissions Trading regulations, for a total installed furnace power of 520 MW. Carbon dioxide emissions
recorded in 2018, equal to 158,737 tonnes, are lower than those of 2017 (178,161 tonnes), mainly due to a
milder climate, noting that all the plants feed district heating networks whose energy demand depends on
seasonal weather. For all the plants concerned, the maximum emissions limit set for 2018 is 34,487 tonnes,
in down as planned compared to the previous year as envisaged by the regulatory system. The free quota
allocation in 2018 amounted to 18,546 tonnes.

The sale of natural gas item includes the production of the gas sold (upstream) and its use by customers. The sales of
electricity item include the generation of the not renewable electricity sold. Emissions from industrial cogeneration
contracts include the production of gas consumed (upstream) in industrial cogeneration plants operated as a service
by HSE and the gas consumption of plants operated as a service by HSE. Le emissions of services operated as a service
include: (i) the extraction and transport of fuels used in the Group’s vehicles; (ii) the use of vehicles by suppliers for
waste collection; (iii) the use of glass, plastic and recovered paper; (iv) the printing of bills. Emissions relating to
energy consumed include electricity grid losses and the extraction and transport of fuels used to generate electricity.

As in 2017, we once again calculated our scope 3 emissions, i.e. indirect greenhouse gas emissions that
occur as a result of the company’s activities, but from sources that are not owned or directly controlled by
the organization. This category may include activities both upstream and downstream of the business
perimeter, such as the extraction and production of purchased raw materials or emissions occurring in the
use-phase of the products sold. The total emissions of the categories considered in the calculation
