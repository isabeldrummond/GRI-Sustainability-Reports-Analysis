has included the customers of AcegasApsAmga (Padua and Trieste), Hera Comm Marche (Pesaro and

The satisfaction index increased in 2018: it rose by one point and settled at 71, exceeding the high
satisfaction threshold. The satisfaction rating for the services provided remained stable at 75 points: again
an excellent result. All services exceed the threshold of 70 points, which indicates a high level of
satisfaction.

The contact channels show an excellent level of customer satisfaction and above all are consistently high:
the ratings of branch offices, call centres and online services are above 78 points, which means that
customers will always find competent operators and appropriate procedures, regardless of the contact
channel. The “app” channel started to be monitored in 2017, reaching a satisfaction rating of 79 in 2018.
Customer loyalty grew for the second year in a row, reaching an excellent rating of 80.

The methodology used for the customer satisfaction survey

The Customer Satisfaction survey is based on an internationally recognised methodology designed to assess
the quality of services offered and customers’ overall satisfaction with Hera. The number of telephone
interviews rose by 5%, settling at over 6,500 replies. The survey was conducted by Computer Aided
Telephone Interviews (CATI) with a survey population chosen so as to ensure that the sample is
representative of the customers of all of the Group’s services. Monitoring was carried out by interviewing
the main contact for Hera within the household. The questionnaire, which lasts around 15 minutes,
monitors satisfaction components and measures future behaviour (word-of-mouth, loyalty etc.) towards
the company. The assessments of the results are expressed in numerical scales, divided into levels of
satisfaction: under 50 points indicates insufficiency; up to 60, “minimal” satisfaction; between 60 and 70, a
good level of satisfaction, and above 70, a high level of satisfaction.

From the second half of 2017, the call centres, branches, Online Services and app are monitored through
daily interviews conducted the day after the contact has been made, in order to gain insight into the
