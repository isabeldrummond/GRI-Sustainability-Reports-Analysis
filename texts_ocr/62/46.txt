Case study

Promotion of energy efficiency

The renovation of public lighting services

In 2018, work was completed in the Municipality of Ceccano (FR), where the remaining 1,500 light points
have already been renovated, out of 3,500 in total. The works to make the plants compliant and to ensure
they are safe include, among other things, the replacement of sections of the power line, for a total of over
4 km. The traffic lights will also be fitted with LED lamps. Particular attention is paid to the old city centre,
where the planned installation of artistic lanterns has been completed to further enhance this special part
of town. We expect energy savings of over 70% compared to the initial state of the systems, which means
about 290 toe, and a reduction of about 625 tonnes/year of CO2 emissions.

Work has also been completed in Aviano (PN), Chions (PN), Faedis (UD), Porcia (PN), Rho (Ml), Rivolta
d’Adige (CR), Spinea (VE), Vejano (VT), while work has begun in Ardea (RM), Caprino Bergamasco (BG),
Civitella del Tronto (TE), Colonnella (TE), Giulianova (TE), Madone (BG), Martinsicuro (TE), Sarezzo (BS),
Suisio (BG) and Tortoreto (TE). The works carried out in 2018 will save 8,739,000 kWh of electricity each
year, corresponding to 1,634 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). Considering an average electricity consumption
of a household of four people equal to 2,700 kWh per year, the amount of energy that will be saved each
year with the measures Hera Luce made in 2018 is equivalent to the annual consumption of 3,237
households.

In 2018 Hera Luce was awarded the contract for the award and management of works to improve the
efficiency of public lighting systems in the municipalities of Lignano Sabbiadoro (UD), Madone (BG), Suisio
(BG), Curno (BG), Sarezzo (BS), Marcheno (BS), Bernate Ticino (MI), Carbognano (VT) and Misano Adriatico
(RN).

The environmental impact in terms of energy savings and avoided emissions for the measures planned for
2019 is 1,300 toe.

New heating management contract in Modena with energy efficiency objectives

The Contract entered into by the Hera Group and the Municipality of Modena is an important example of
an Energy Performance Contract (EPC), awarded to the Group as a result of a European Public Tender,
competing with some of the most important companies in the industry.

The Hera Group, which partnered in the tender with Sinergie Spa (now AcegasApsAmga Servizi Energetici)
committed to provide significant results to the Municipality in terms of energy efficiency improvement, to
be achieved through both management improvements and energy renovation measures.

In particular, Hera Group’s offer included a 18% reduction of thermal energy consumption compared to the
past consumption (based on the average of the last 5 years) for the buildings included in the scope of the
contract, and also planned to improve this performance by a further 10% due to energy efficiency
improvement measures which will involve investments of Euro 7 million in the first years of the contract.

From the systems engineering point of view, the most significant investments concern implementing
energy renovation measures for the thermal power plants, installing thermostatic valves on radiators,
replacing burners, building solar thermal and photovoltaic systems, renovating lighting systems by installing
LED lamps. “Passive” measures to limit heat dispersion from buildings also play an important role, including
installing vertical cladding insulation on 12 buildings and insulating the roofs of 10 others.

During 2018, the positive effect of our management measures undertaken was confirmed, as we achieved a
18% improvement with respect to the historical data used as a basis for the tender (monitored during
contract management). The first tranche of interventions was also carried out, both for the plant
