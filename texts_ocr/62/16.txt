Shared value

An EBITDA of Euro 375 million (+14% compared to 2017) generated in 2018 from activities related to the
“Global Agenda” priorities

Our approach to shared value

A process was started in 2016 to identify Hera’s approach to Creating Shared Value (CSV). Inspiration was
taken from Porter and Kramer’s indications in 2011 and taking into account the new EU communication on
CSR of the same year. The programme made it possible to identify our own definition of CSV which is
steering our approach to CSR and has enhanced our sustainability reporting with new views and
perspectives, among which quantification of EBITDA generated by “shared value” activities and projects,
and of investments made in this area.

 

For Hera, the creation of shared value is the result of all those business activities that generate operating
margins and meet the global agenda drivers, i.e. those “calls to action” for change in specific fields, set out
in global, European, national and local policies.

This definition of CSV is at the basis of a new, evolved approach to social responsibility and sustainability;
besides having already enhanced non-financial reporting available to our stakeholders, it is also an
important source of inspiration for future strategies and new projects, in line with the sustainable
development targets of the 2030 UN Agenda. For Hera, the CSV approach is a consolidated point of
reference for the reclassification of economic results, developed projects and future goals, in addition to
representing a guide for strategic investment choices. These aspects are described in the Sustainability
Report with a completely revised list of contents divided by areas identified for the creation of shared
value.

How we identified the “calls to action”

In 2018, we continued to analyse the “Global Agenda” and the needs for change that are outlined in it,
which represent the “calls to action” for a company like Hera. Understanding and sharing this scenario is
essential for outlining the way we report the sustainability results achieved. At the same time, it is also an
opportunity to steer strategy and operational processes in order to address change and meet the needs
and expectations of both the market and society, thus enhancing competitiveness.

The process started by analysing European, national and local policies and ended by identifying Hera’s
Drivers of Change and Impact Areas, while keeping in mind its spheres of competence.

Forty-five global, European, national and local policies were analysed to define the priorities for change

towards sustainability, including the 2030 UN Agenda. Further 18 policies were added to this first set, which

were examined in detail in 2018. The commitments and quantitative targets of these policies which are of

key significance to Hera’s activity were analysed. Nine Impact Areas were defined by identifying the cross-
