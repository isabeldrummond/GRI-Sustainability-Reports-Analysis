District heating: energy sold and volume served

 

 

 

 

2016 2017 2018
Thermal energy sold (MWh) 487,896 499,144 500,916
Volumes served (thousands of m?) 20,396 20,935 21,174
Housing unit equivalents served (no.) 84,987 87,231 88,225

 

 

 

 

 

The housing unit equivalents were calculated on the basis of an average apartment volume of 240 m®. Excluding AcegasApsAmga.

The volume served increased by 1.1% compared to 2017 due to commercial development initiatives.
Thermal energy is substantially stable compared to 2017, and is affected, in addition to the seasonality, by
the fact that some systems present in 2017 were sold in 2018.

Cogeneration for district heating

The term cogeneration identifies the combined production of electricity and thermal energy from a single
source (whether fossil fuel or renewable) implemented in a single integrated system. This is done in
specially-designed thermoelectric power plants, which recover heat from the flue gas produced by an
engine powered by any fuel: thus, obtaining a significant energy savings (about 40%) compared to separate
electricity and thermal energy production.

Thanks to their connection with district heating networks, Hera Group’s cogeneration plants help improve
the air quality of the towns where they are located: thanks to them many boilers have been replaced with
modern, efficient systems to heat and supply hot water to buildings. With district heating, systems are
monitored continuously, both in terms of combustion processes and atmospheric emissions.

Hera S.p.A. — District Heating Department operates 10 cogeneration plants, of which 3 are trigeneration
plants, for an overall nominal electric capacity of 27.15 MW which in 2018 produced 201,138 MWh of
thermal energy for district heating in all our service areas.

Atmospheric emissions generated by district heating

In 2018, the district heating plants produced a total of 679.8 GWh of electricity and thermal energy, down

1.1% compared to 2017. Retention of maintenance activities carried out on our plants, the objective of

optimising production and network management and the integrated management of the source portfolio

allowed savings of 36,495 toe in 2018, slightly down by 954 toe (equal to 2.5% less) compared to 2017.
