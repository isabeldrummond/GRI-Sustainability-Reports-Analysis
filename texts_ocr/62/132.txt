The application of the Agreements continued in 2018, to prevent service disconnections for assisted
persons. The Group’s attention to the weaker social groups is also confirmed by its collaboration over many
years with the Social Services of the municipalities and with the Organizations that provide services to
citizens, an aspect that sets Hera apart in the panorama of multi-utilities and sales companies and provides
a dedicated channel with operators that offer support and counselling to social workers through structured
forms of relief for the most economically fragile portion of society. Collaboration with the Authorities
makes it possible to avoid service disconnections or reactivation of the service if it has been stopped,
optimizing the management of economic contributions by the Social Services.

In 2018, more than 17,000 requests were handled in Emilia-Romagna, following reports from social
workers, and 89.6% of disconnections were avoided. The number of municipalities which have agreed to
the protocol has remained unchanged at 85. All the provincial capitals of Emilia-Romagna are concerned,
except for Rimini.

AcegasApsAmga also continues to collaborate with the municipalities of Trieste and Padua, within the
framework of the protocols signed for the management of users in economic difficulty. These agreements
involve instalment payments on bills, granting subsidies and preventing service disconnections. In 2018,
there were 914 water service-related contacts, of which 815 in the municipality of Trieste and 99 in the
municipality of Padua.

In 2010, on its own initiative, Hera introduced a bonus to offset expenses for the district heating service, to
be attributed to customers who have the income requirements with the same procedures as those used for
gas and electricity expense compensation. The bonus for 2018 is worth Euro 118 per year for households
up to 4 members, and Euro 163 per year for households with a greater number of members. At the date of
approval of this Report, 1,050 applications had been submitted for 2018 (1,070 in 2017) amounting to
about Euro 130 thousand.

As regards Hera and AcegasApsAmga, the contracts state that if the bill is not paid the service may be
disconnected. In these cases, a first reminder is sent approximately 20 days after the bill’s expiry (only for
reliable payers and debts of up to Euro 150) and a subsequent reminder (after an additional 20 days) is sent
by registered mail, to inform the customer that the service may be disconnected. For amounts due under
Euro 150, if payment is not made the supply is disconnected, on average two months after the bill’s due
date. If the invoice is for more than Euro 150, a single reminder is sent by registered mail, warning the
customer that their service may be disconnected. In this case, the service can be disconnected about one
