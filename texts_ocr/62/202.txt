Furthermore, in 2018, specific activities were carried out to analyse the company areas that in the 2017
survey had achieved results that were not in line with the Group score, in order to better address further
improvement actions.

Anew company climate survey will be carried out in 2019 according to the biennial survey programme that
started in 2005.

Internal communication

Many communication activities and aggregation initiatives were implemented during the year to increase
the dissemination and sharing of corporate projects and to stimulate the involvement of the entire
workforce as part of the Hera community.

The growth process of the digital House Organ continued in 2018: thanks to no less than 340 articles
published during the year, it is now considered, together with the company intranet, the leading tool for
communication to Group employees. Smart working was one of the most covered topics, designed to
reconsider collaborative and team working methods and to seize the opportunities that technology and
space can offer to people, allowing them to find a greater balance between work and private life.

2018 was the year of the third edition of HeraSolidale, the Group’s solidarity project that supports charity
associations throughout the local area. The high level of participation by employees in this edition, which is
still ongoing, has already made it possible to increase memberships, increase the social impact of the
project and contribute to the 2030 UN Agenda priorities. A new, important aspect in 2018 was the
extension of the project to customers, in order to achieve a common goal of solidarity of even greater
significance.

Again with a view to contributing to the UN Agenda goals, an internal energy efficiency awareness
campaign was carried out during the year to spread a culture in the workplace which is more aware of
energy resources. Staff was involved with information and advice on how to save and help the
environment, by paying attention to the use of air conditioning, lighting, multi-function printers and paper.

In order to spread an increasingly aware workplace health and safety culture, an internal campaign was
launched to raise awareness and train on road safety and health driving styles. The campaign included the
creation of various communication materials such as self-supporting posters located in the car parks of the
main company offices, videos, screensavers and an online browsable learning magazine with practical
information and interactive exercises to prevent home-work accidents.

Employee participation in the 19 Facciamo il punto (Let’s take stock) meetings was high (over 7,000
employees). The meetings were held in 14 cities throughout the area served by the Group and allowed the
Chairman and Managing Director to inform employees about strategies, results achieved and future goals.
For the first time in 2018, one of the events was also held in Ospedaletto d’Istrana, in the province of
Treviso, where the newly acquired company, Aliplast, is based.

After the success in 2017, the Percorsi nel cuore di Hera (Journey into the heart of Hera) continued. In
2018, staff was able to discover circular economy by visiting the plants of Waste Recycling and Aliplast.
Over 260 Hera employees and their family members arrived from the Group’s different areas to discover
the technological secrets of our plants, to get to know the work of their colleagues better and to share
professional opinions.

The recreational and sporting gatherings organised together with employee recreational associations
continued to be greatly appreciated: the eleventh edition of Hera Ski Adventure, the long skiing weekend
for employees and their families, counted over 500 participants with a rich programme of activities also for
non-skiers, in a highly exciting and inclusive environment.

Even the benefits reserved to employees for access to exhibitions, performances and concerts in which
Hera was involved as sponsor or partner attracted strong interest: over 1,362 people used these benefits
and enjoyed cultural initiatives throughout the area served.
