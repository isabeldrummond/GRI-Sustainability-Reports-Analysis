In 2018 the Hera Group contributed to over 150 activities with Euro 2.4 million of sponsorships that in
various fields contributed to enrich the content and the initiatives of the local communities. In fact, of the
total of sponsorships, 91% was allocated to the local area.

In this perspective, the Group’s commitment to promoting art, music, cinema, theatre, sports and
community support becomes the driver both to convey highly artistic content, and to make it usable and
accessible to all.

Art. During 2018, Hera contributed to the creation of prominent shows, exhibitions and artistic projects.
Among the most significant partnerships: the “Eterno e Tempo fra Michelangelo e Caravaggio” (Eternal
and Time between Michelangelo and Caravaggio) exhibit set up at the San Domenico Museums in Forli,
which attracted 100,000 visitors from all over Italy; the “Revolutija: da Chagall a Malevich, da Repin a
Kandinsky” (Revolutija: da Chagall a Malevich, da Repin a Kandinsky) exhibit at the Mambo in Bologna,
which allowed the public to admire about 70 masterpieces by famous painters who in various ways
represented Russian artistic culture between the 19th and 20th centuries. 2018 was also the year of
drawing: the 12th edition of “Bilbolbul”, the international comics festival of which Hera is the main
founding partner, brought to Bologna, for the first time in Italy, the exhibition dedicated to “Jack Kirby”, the
king of superheroes. The 3rd edition of the “Biennale del disegno” in Rimini transformed the city into a
beating heart of creativity and research through 33 exhibitions and a journey through 2,000 works, which
touched upon all the creative processes: ancient and modern drawing, comics and architecture, calligraphy
and graphics, painting, street art and cinema.

Access to culture and support for the area are evident concepts also thanks to the Group’s commitment to
SalaBorsa, the historical library in Bologna which thanks to Hera’s support can now extend its opening
hours in the winter, and stay open to all, also on Sundays.

Art and the local area are key concepts also in the project supported at Imola, where Inrete, a company of
the Hera Group, promoted the project “TAG: Torre Arte e Graffiti”. It is an initiative of urban regeneration
and promotion of the area that has transformed eight electric substations into eight works of art with the
collaboration of a local association consisting of many young people.

Theatre. From Modena to Rimini, the Hera Group has maintained a high level of interest in the theatres
and theatre seasons in the area. From the Teatro Comunale in Bologna with the operas “Simon
Boccanegra” and “La fille du Regiment”, to the ERT Foundation, from the Teatri Comunali in Modena and
Ferrara to the International Theatre Festival in Piazza di Santarcangelo di Romagna, the Hera Group has
supported small and large recognized organizations of excellence by promoting and disseminating culture.
Hera has also helped the most important events of Romagna’s art season by supporting reviews which, in
the city as in its province, can thus schedule high quality shows and artists. For instance, it is worth
mentioning the partnership with the Teatro Rossini in Lugo, with the Rete dei Teatri della Valmarecchia in
the Rimini area, with the season of the Teatro Mentore di Santa Sofia in the upper Cesena area, while in
Emilia Hera supported the season of theatres of the Fondazione ERT (the Storchi and Passioni theatres in
Modena, Arena del Sole in Bologna, and the Fabbri theatre in Vignola), the Teatro Duse in Bologna and the
Teatro Comunale in Modena and Ferrara. In the Modena area, among the leading and high-profile
initiatives also at national level, there was the Group’s presence at Festivalfilosofia, which promoted Julian
Nida Rumil’s lectio magistralis on democracy in Piazza Grande.

Music. Every year, Hera identifies the concert seasons of great excellence, of interest to a broad range of
audiences. Among these, there is the Bologna Festival with the “I grandi interpreti (The great performers)”
review, the Musica Insieme Foundation and the Ravenna Festival, the prestigious exhibition that in 2018
also due to Herambiente’s support, staged its 29th edition, dedicated to America, land of dreams, under
the slogan “We Have a Dream”. Herambiente considered it important to support the Ravenna Festival and
be part of the success of one of the most prestigious and acclaimed festivals of performing arts at a
European level: from symphonic to chamber music, from opera to theatre, from dance to ethnic music for a
varied and diverse audience.

On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the death of the composer Gioacchino Rossini, the Group is a
partner of the events organized by the City of Pesaro to celebrate the musician’s life and work.
