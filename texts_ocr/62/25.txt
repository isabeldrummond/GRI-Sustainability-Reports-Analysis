Promotion of energy efficiency

Primary energy consumption of the Hera Group
Hera’s energy consumption reflects the Group’s multi-business nature.

The balanced portfolio of its businesses creates synergies that increase productivity in multiple sectors
while reducing energy consumption. Hera manages cogeneration plants for district heating which produce
thermal energy and electricity to sell to its clients, and cogeneration plants, mainly to satisfy internal
consumption requirements. It also manages waste-to-energy plants that dispose of waste with subsequent
energy recovery, turboexpanders that take advantage of pressure differentials in the natural gas
distribution stations in the local managed networks, and the recovery of low enthalpy geothermic heat at
the district heating plant in Ferrara. Furthermore, a part of the electricity produced by the Group’s
photovoltaic plants is used for self-consumption. Through a continuous series of measures, Hera pursues a
policy aimed at increasing the energy efficiency throughout its business.

In 2018, primary energy consumption increased compared to the previous year (+7.8%), due to the
inclusion of methane gas consumption of in-service cogeneration plants (30,071 toe), operated by Hera
Servizi Energia for its customers and not included in previous years in the scope of reporting. On a like-for-
like basis, overall consumption increase by 3.0%. Electricity consumption increase slightly (-1% in public
lighting - thanks to the energy efficiency measures implemented - and +3.6% in other consumption).
