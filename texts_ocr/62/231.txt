Includes the services for which customers must be automatically compensated if the company does not comply with
the standard. The data relating to the sales quality standards do not include Estenergy and AcegasAps Service.

In almost all cases, the individual services consolidated their good results compared with the times
recorded in 2017. In particular, this year there was a consolidation of the massive service relating to the
frequency of collection of meter readings for invoicing, where the 99.9% of last year was confirmed while
the activation of the supply for gas (from 99.8% to 99.9%) was confirmed as being of high quality. For the
electricity supply service, the activation of the electricity supply improved (from 99.1% to 99.3%), and that
for the deactivation of the supply (requested by the customer to its salesperson), which increased from
98.6% to 99.5% while the re-activation after late payment of electricity worsened slightly (from 98.4% to
98.3%). The standard measurement collection frequency also includes the new remotely-read meters of
the gas service.

For the water service, the high standard of the service with the highest number of appointments is
confirmed: the punctuality bands for appointments are confirmed at 99.5% (was 99.6% in 2017).

Initiatives for improving the quality of readings

As regards the gas service, ARERA’s resolution 117/2015/R/gas changed the frequency of readings,
including a reading every four months, and the concept of periods relevant for meter reading. In response
to this resolution, the Hera Group has presented an improvement plan, approved by AEEGSI, to maintain
the benefits added by the new regulation and, at the same time, optimize reading loads throughout the
year. Starting 1 January 2016, this has made it possible to start a new reading plan that includes:

e four attempts per year to take a reading for all customers with annual consumption between 501
and 5,000 m? instead of the two required for customers with annual consumption between 501 and
1,500 and the three required for customers with annual consumption between 1,501 and 5,000.

¢ two attempts per year to take a reading for all customers with annual consumption between 0 and
500 m3, instead of the single reading required.

By doing so, the reading plan has made it possible to increase the quantity of readings collected by the
distributor, optimize the reading workloads and reduce the number of readings that are estimated.

This system of readings, although an improvement over the resolution, led in 2016 and 2017 to decoupling
the gas meter-reading rounds due to the different frequencies required, and to the loss of the previous
advantage of multi-business reading with other services, especially water.
