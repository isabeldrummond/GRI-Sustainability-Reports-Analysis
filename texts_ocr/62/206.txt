pizza cartons. Several communication tools were used: panels applied to collection containers, the
involvement of target users (pizza-chefs), window stickers for shops and mascots dressed up as pizza
cartons who reinforced the message at markets by handing out flyers and meeting people. Furthermore, a
separate waste collection guide was delivered to the households of Fiorano Modenese to remind them of
correct material separation rules.

In 2018, Hera was also involved in a broad-ranging water campaign.
The campaign was set up following a study on citizens in the area served. Its aim was to understand
citizens’ perception of the quality of tap water, the reasons why it is little used as “drinking water” and the
most frequent doubts. It was launched on 22 March on the World Water Day, with information points in
main town squares, and continued with publications in local newspapers and flyers attached to all citizens’
bills. The highlight of the campaign was the theatrical performance “Volo sull’acqua” (“Flight over water”),
written by entomologist and writer Gianumberto Accinelli, and interpreted together with Fabio Volo, to
discover the value of water through the long chain that allows it to be collected, become drinkable and be
supplied to homes. Seven cities (Bologna, Modena, Ravenna, Rimini, Cesena, Ferrara and Trieste) staged
the performance, which light-heartedly and with a touch of laughter addressed the main topics of tap
water. It debunked false beliefs and pointed out water’s characteristics and the 5 good reasons to drink it:
strict daily checks, the work of professionals who always make sure that tap water is safe and good to drink,
not to mention that it is environmentally friendly, because it saves on plastic bottles, it is a local product
since withdrawn from sources located in nearby areas, and is cheaper than bottled water.
