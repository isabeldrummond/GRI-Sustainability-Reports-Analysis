sewage-purification plants, located in the Bologna area. The system was introduced to monitor access to
these sites following the ever-increasing need to acquire and produce - in the event of
verification/objection to any anomalies by the control bodies - certain and undeniable information
regarding access to the plants for their correct management/maintenance.

On 11 June 2018, the Local Trade Unions of Ferrara - Waste Management Division and the Single Trade
Union Representation of Hera S.p.A. - National Collective Labour Agreement for Waste Management
Services signed a Meeting Report regarding the variation to working hours for the personnel of Hera
S.p.A.’s Waste Management Services Department in the Ferrara Area. This change was necessary as a result
of the company’s new technical, production and organisational requirements.

On 14 June 2018, Inrete Distribuzione Energia S.p.A, the Local Trade Unions of Modena - Energy Division
and the Single Trade Union Representation - National Collective Labour Agreement for the Electrical Sector
of the Modena Area signed a Meeting Report to supersede the Electricity Emergency Response H16 shift.
Together with the superseding of the H16 shift Emergency Response service, instead of introducing a daily
schedule from Monday to Friday, the organisational on-call model was also reviewed. This re-organisation
ensured overall greater technical and organisational efficiency.

During 2018, the shared examination procedures, provided for by law, were carried out with regard to:

e the transfer from HERAtech Srl, to Inrete Distribuzione Energia SpA, of the company branch dealing
with the electricity distribution inspection, quoting, design and work development activities. This
transaction made it possible to concentrate in a single corporate structure all the electricity
distribution quoting, design and construction activities in order to achieve greater overall
effectiveness and higher operating efficiency with regard to on-field activities and on-call
management.

e the merger by incorporation of Amga Energia & Servizi S.r.|. into Hera Comm S.r.I.. This transaction,
which is part of a broader project for the aggregation of sales companies throughout the country,
allowed the marketing of Gas and Electricity to be incorporated in a single legal entity.

e the partial and proportional demerger by incorporation of C.M.V. Energia&Ilmpianti S.r.l. into Hera
Comm S.r.l. involving the business branch relating to the sale of electricity and natural gas,
including all electricity and gas customers. This transaction also allowed the above activities to be
incorporated into a single legal entity, as well as to achieve both economies of scale and
operational synergies. As part of this transaction, the application of remuneration consistent with
second-level bargaining in effect in the Hera Group was also defined for the personnel of C.M.V.
Energia&Ilmpianti S.r.l..

On 3 April 2018 and on 18 July 2018, following the acquisition of the majority of the shares of Aliplast S.p.A.
and Alimpet S.r.l. by the HERA Group, Trade Union Agreements regarding the definition of the
Performance Bonus for 2018 and 2019, as well as recognition of the Hera Group Flexible Welfare Package,
were entered into with Local Trade Unions and the Single Trade Union Representation.

During 2018, with the aim of integrating Acantho S.p.A. into the Group’s Trade Union Relations at the end
of the two-year period 2018-2019, agreements were entered into between Acantho S.p.A. itself, the Local
Trade Unions of Imola and Modena - Telecommunications Division, and the Single Trade Union
Representation of Acantho S.p.A., regarding the renewal of the Performance Bonus, work/life balance and
the implementation of the Smart-Remote Working operational mode.

On 10 October 2018, Hera Servizi Energia S.r.| and the Single Trade Union Representation entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding concerning the installation of GPS navigation and satellite tracking on
individual devices, already used by workers (smartphone, smartwatch, company computers), for exclusively
organisational and safety reasons. Installing these systems made it possible to promptly detect any
dangerous situations for the operators and subsequently organise response operations in the event of
emergency situations.
