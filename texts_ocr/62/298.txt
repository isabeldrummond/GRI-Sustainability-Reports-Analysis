With respect to the previous years, a selection of suppliers was made with commodities groups relating to
activities with little significance from the standpoint of safety, the related amounts were excluded from
that consumed and therefore from the calculation base for the objective fixed at 70%. The contractual
obligation for the forwarding of the accident data does not lapse for these suppliers.

833 suppliers answered the survey in 2018 (696 in 2017) for a total of Euro 492 million in terms of value of
contracts (Euro 468 million in 2017). 75% of suppliers involved in the monitoring were monitored in 2018.

Overall, 336 accidents were monitored, the calculation of the data identified an average frequency index of
24.05 and a severity index of 0.58, up with respect to the previous year (the 2017 values were 15.2 and
0.42 respectively).

Analysing the commodity groups of two significant commodities from an accident standpoint (work of the
“general works” and environmental services categories), it can be observed that the values of the
frequency index are equal to 19.6 and 45.9 respectively, while the severity index stands at 0.66 and 1.07.

Supplier relations

During 2018, Hera participated in a number of meetings with the main trade associations, such as for
example “Romagna Business Matching” organised by Confindustria Romagna and Confindustria Forli-
Cesena. This meeting was an important occasion for discussion and reflection with regard to the changed
legislative scenario with the introduction of the new tender code and subsequent corrective decree and the
ANAC guidelines, with policies and interpretative levels still in the adjustment phase. With a view to this,
the desire of Hera to build a solid relationship with its suppliers was further reaffirmed, marked by the
utmost transparency, making information the mainstay of the relationship with the Vendors. The new IT
model for the alternation of suppliers was also illustrated at this juncture (see section “Qualification,
selection and assessment of suppliers”).

In conclusion, as usual, at the end of the year the customary meetings were held with representatives of
social cooperatives working in the areas served by the Hera Group, to discuss the 2018 results. On the basis
of the analysis of the data collected, the work group active in the meetings confirmed the validity of the
procedures defined for monitoring. The encounters also pertained to the ways to promote employment
projects, illustrated in the section “Economic development and social inclusion”.

Litigation with suppliers

The number of disputes fell: at the end of 2018, there were 36 disputes pending with the suppliers,
compared with 40 at the end of 2017. The proceedings activated in 2018 came to 22 and mainly concerned
tender aspects.

Case study
The supplier monitoring plan with a focus on social responsibility

During 2018, an additional 90 questionnaires for SA 8000 assessment were received from suppliers
deemed as critical in terms of activities and contractual amounts. The documents were examined and steps
were taken to request clarification and additions for incomplete or missing parts. Furthermore, 197
disclosure measures on the legislation were reported on, by the companies, vis-a-vis their workers.

Furthermore, during 2018 8 SA8000 audits were carried out of which 7 care of the headquarters of the

suppliers and one directly on site: in several cases, it became necessary to carry out additional checks to

control the effective launch of the improvement process agreed on and the activation of the corrective

actions. 12 additional audits were carried out directly at the Hera Group worksites, jointly with the QSE

Department. The audits at the premises of suppliers were carried out by certified external personnel with
