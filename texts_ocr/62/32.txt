Energy efficiency services for the Public Administration, condominiums and businesses

Through its subsidiaries Hera Servizi Energia (HSE) and AcegasApsAmga Servizi Energetici (ASE), the Hera
Group also operates actively in the energy efficiency sector providing a broad range of services. The
company mainly targets apartment buildings, large industrial customers and the public administration.

The HSE and ASE solutions are mainly addressed to condominiums with central heating to implement
measures supported by ecobonus and sismabonus incentives. In addition to building thermal insulations,
ventilated facades, replacing doors and windows and implementing seismic improvement and adaptation
measures, HSE and ASE offer condominiums the replacement of boilers and individual metering of
expenses, the control of heating systems and hot water production using thermal solar panels or by
installing heat pumps. The condominiums that have carried out several energy refurbishment measures at
the same time, individual metering and transformed their heating system, have achieved savings of 20% to
40% of their consumption. Moreover, thanks to the assigning of receivables and the energy service
contract, the measures did not involve any disbursement at the end of the works for the customers.

The commercial solutions, in fact, are integrated with the assigning of receivables relating to the ecobonus
and sismabonus incentives for energy-related and structural upgrading of buildings, leaving the possibility
for each owner to independently choose among a range of solutions that one that best suits its disposable
income. Customers can choose whether to bear the cost of the work realized and later deduct the amount
on their tax return, assign the tax deduction and pay the excess at the end of the work, or choose for the
solution that requires no disbursement at the end of the work adding to the assigning of receivables the
financing of the remaining portion, even combined with an energy service that provides a guarantee of
energy savings and thus a reduction of heating costs.

At the end of 2018, the professionalism and experience of HSE and ASE have achieved a portfolio of 467
condominiums (+16% compared to 2017) for HSE and 411 condominiums (+35% compared to 2017) for
ASE.

In the industrial cogeneration sector, Hera Servizi Energia offers multi-year energy supply contracts through
the development and management of electricity and thermal energy production plants dedicated to
meeting all the energy needs of top customers. The main product sectors in which the energy service is
particularly effective are plastics, food, pharmaceuticals, ceramics and large-scale services such as
museums, shopping centres, spas and condominiums.

With cogeneration and trigeneration (production of electricity and thermal energy at the same plant, plus
cooling services) primary energy is saved with respect to traditional consumption, emissions are reduced,
energy efficiency is increased and supply costs are reduced.

HSE offers a full range of all energy carriers, making it inexpensive and easy for the customers to manage.
HSE identifies, in terms of the customer’s energy requirements, the characteristics of the technology plant,
manage the preparation of all authorisation documents, operate and manage the plant.

At the end of 2018, 15 cogeneration plants run by HSE were operational, of which 3 are trigeneration
plants.

The environmental benefits achieved in 2018 by these plants include 14,227 tonnes lower CO2 emissions
and primary energy savings of approx. 6,076 toe.

HSE and ASE operate using public-private partnership instruments in the public administration client
market. Also for this particular type of contract, the Group companies propose significant investments both
