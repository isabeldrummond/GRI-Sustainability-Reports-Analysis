District heating for Universities

We have completed the district heating
network that connects the centre of Forli
to the university campus, powered by a
trigeneration plant, which simultaneously
produces heat, cooling and electricity. The
development of district heating in Forli will
avoid 7,277 tonnes of CO2 equivalent to
about 73 thousand trees.

CSV Case Study

WEEE for social purposes

There are 2 work training projects for
prisoners in the Forli prison: “Manolibera”
is an artisan paper factory that produces
high quality paper objects; under “WEEE in
prison” detainees disassemble electronic
waste and prepare it for recovery, a sector
of the circular economy.

 

Energy saving measures with LEDs

In 2018, work started for the renovation of
public lighting in Forli. 11,000 light points

consumption), equal to 837 tonnes of
greenhouse gasses not emitted into the
