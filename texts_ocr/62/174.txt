The 10 reports of the employees concern the relationship between colleagues and between
manager/workers, the collaboration between company departments and the communication to the
employees, the valorisation of the human resources, the safeguarding of the individuals and equal
opportunities and the work environments. With regard to seven reports, in the preliminary investigative
phase, the Ethics and Sustainability Committee assessed the need to involve the Central Personnel and
Organisation Department as well as the reference structures of the reporting party. In five cases, within the
sphere of the preliminary investigation of the report, the Committee contacted/met the person making the
report. Four reports as of 31 December 2018 were not yet concluded while for one the Ethics and
Sustainability Committee resolved not to proceed with the opening of the preliminary investigative phase
due to limits of the competence of the Committee (Art. 70). Consequent to one report, the Committee
resolved to adopt a disciplinary measure vis-a-vis a worker who was responsible for seriously offensive
conduct vis-a-vis the party making the report.

Customer reports regarded the commercial conduct of sales agencies and the response times and/or the
time required to carry out the services (payment instalments, termination of supply, invoicing
adjustments). With regard to one report, the Ethics Committee requested Hera Comm to include the failure
to observe the principles of the Code of Ethics among the clauses for termination of the agency mandate.
With regard to five reports, thanks to the collaboration of the structures involved, a positive response to
the request of the customers was achieved. With regard to one report, the intervention of the Ethics and
Sustainability Committee led to the formulation of a reply clarifying the position of the company.

The only report from suppliers did not lead to any preliminary investigation since, in agreement with the
Procurement and Tenders Department, the firm in question was included in the 2018 suppliers audit plan,
drawn up in accordance with the matters envisaged by the integrated management system.

Risk management

Hera has adopted an organisational structure suited to adequately manage the exposure to risk inherent in
its business. It has defined an integrated approach aimed at maintaining management effectiveness and
profitability along the entire value chain.

The corporate governance system for risk management implemented in Hera allows management
strategies to be addressed consistently. In this system:

* the Board of Directors steers and evaluates the adequacy of the internal control and risk management
system;

* the Executive Chairman and the Managing Director monitor, within their competence, the operation
of the internal control and risk management system;
