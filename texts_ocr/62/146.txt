The plant renovation process has resulted in a significant improvement in the abatement percentages of
pollutant emissions:

e in January 2008, two new lines of the Ferrara waste-to-energy plant became fully operational;
the new Forli plant became fully operational at the beginning of 2009;
e in April 2010, the new line 4 of the Modena waste-to-energy plant became operational;
e in October 2010, the new line 4 of the Rimini waste-to-energy plant became operational;
In 2018, the average concentrations of the atmospheric emissions of the waste-to-energy plants were
13.8% of the regulatory limit. This means that in 2018, emissions were 86.2% below the limit, while in
2003 the percentage stood at 59%. The levels of parameters that do not require continuous
monitoring (total metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans, cadmium and
thallium, mercury) are also below legal limits: from -95% to -99%.
