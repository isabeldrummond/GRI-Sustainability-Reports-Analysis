cooperation and planning tools. Remote working, i.e. working for one day a week from a place other than
the assigned location (including from home), was the main project carried out within the time and
performance area. It was further developed and disseminated in 2018. Furthermore, as part of the projects
regarding “space”, smart points were set up in a number of buildings on an experimental basis: these multi-
purpose spaces respond more effectively to the need to find a place to cooperate and exchange views (with
internal or external colleagues), or the need to have more reserved areas to better concentrate.

In 2018, completely satisfactory results were achieved both in terms of improving productivity and
improving satisfaction. This is also why the project will be extended to further 1,500 people in 2019.
Consequently, we will continue to invest in communication towards all employees and in specific training
on the new process and on specific skills to make smart working more effective. The aim will be to continue
measuring both collective and individual benefits, enhancing new opportunities and creating conditions to
jointly increase productivity and well-being.

As part of this process, company management is required to further develop resource management skills
in a context where performance grows in importance compared to the time and physical place of work.
The Group’s Leadership model plays a leading and decisive role in ensuring effective application.

Sustainability in the management bonus system and in the performance bonus

Aspects that refer to sustainability are present in the bonus system for managers and middle managers and
the systems for the determination of the performance bonus used by the Group. The performance bonus is
influenced by indicators that are associated with quality, with work and service safety and with the
environment, while the incentive system, which is connected to the balanced scorecard, provides (ever
since 2006, when the Balanced scorecard system was introduced in the Group with the coordination of the
Shared Value and Sustainability Department) for a part of the incentive to be connected to the
achievement of sustainability targets.

In 2018, 30% of the variable remuneration of Group managers and middle managers was linked to
sustainability target projects (improvement of quality, environmental impact, image, personnel
involvement, professional development and involvement of stakeholders), with sustainability target
projects aimed at creating shared value accounting for 17% (target projects associated with the “smart use

of energy”, “efficient use of resources”, “innovation and contribution to development” CSV drivers).

Up to 25% of the performance bonus for middle managers, white-collar workers and blue-collar workers is
related to shared objectives related to quality, environment and occupational safety.

Sustainability was also included in the deferred incentive plan for management retention redefined by the
Board of Directors in the meeting of 19 December 2018, on the proposal of the Remuneration Committee.
The Plan is reserved to a small number of managers selected by taking into account the weight of the
organisational position, the evaluation of the performances achieved in the development process and the
“market risk”. The development introduced for the three-year period 2019-2021 includes “shared value”
EBITDA among the three indicators used to quantify the bonus to be paid in 2022. The target to be
achieved is set out in the Business Plan for 2021.

Thanks to HeraSolidale, we were able to collect almost Euro 145,000 for 5 Non-Profit Organisations
HeraSolidale was created to promote support among Hera workers for voluntary associations.

The third edition of the project started in 2018 and will last until December 2019. The third edition of the
project involved Group employees who voted for 5 out of the 15 non-profit organisations chosen by the
company, according to the following criteria: reputation and transparency of activities, contribution to one
or more goals of the 2030 UN Agenda, and intervention areas of relevance to Hera services (accessory
criterion).
