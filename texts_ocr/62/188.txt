The portion distributed to Public Administration amounted to Euro 198.2 million, 12.9% of the total (+14%
compared to 2017 mainly due to the increase in taxes and duties and the reduction in public grants
received, only partly offset by the decrease in payments made to the Public Administration authorities).

Duties and taxes amounted to Euro 143.2 million (9.3% of the total value added distributed) up 29%
compared with last year. Of the taxes and duties, Euro 99.1 million was allocated to the Government (Euro
76.1 million in 2017), Euro 32.3 million to the Regional authorities and Euro 11.8 million to the Provincial
and Municipal authorities. Business taxation rose from Euro 92.6 million in 2017 to Euro 121.8 million in
2018.

The plants and installations used by the company are in part owned by shareholding municipalities, and
rental payments are made for their use; the portion for Public Administration also includes environmental
compensations paid to the municipalities regarding the waste treatment plants. In 2018, total payments for
use of the assets of shareholder municipalities and environmental compensations came to Euro 90.4
million. There was also Euro 4.9 million relating to the running costs of the national (Aeegsi and Agcm) and
local authorities. Public grants received in 2018 amounted to Euro 40.2 million, Euro 32.7 million of which
allocated as operating grants and Euro 7.5 million as plant grants; this item, as already indicated, includes
the former green certificates feed in premium contributions for a total of Euro 27.7 million. This amount
was subtracted from the portion allocated to the Public Administration.

Lastly, Euro 2.7 million was allocated to donations (Euro 0.3 million) and sponsorships (Euro 2.4 million);
details on these items can be found in the “Innovation and contribution to development” section (under
