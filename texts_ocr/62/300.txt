CSV Investments

From waste to biomethane, a circular
revolution

In S. Agata Bolognese we built a plant,
without additional consumption of land
and with an investment of Euro 37 million,

to produce 7.5 million m?/year of
biomethane and 20,000 tonnes of
compost for agriculture from 135

thousand tonnes of organic material and
green/pruning material waste, avoiding 14
thousand tonnes/year of CO2.

CSV Case Study

An agreement to re-use water

An agreement was signed to re-use water
from the treatment plant in Bologna to the
benefit of the balance of local water
bodies in the event of drought. In 2018
about 500 thousand m? of water were
used for that purpose.

 

Separate waste collection in Bologna’s
city centre reached 62%

In four years separate waste collection
doubled (from 28% in 2014 to 62% in
2018) thanks to 109 mini-drop-off points
underground islands and 14 drop-off
points above ground. The quality of the
sorting is high, with conforming materials
at around 90%.
