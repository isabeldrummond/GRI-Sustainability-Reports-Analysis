The value of supplies from local companies reached 69% of total results, coming to Euro 632 million (+7%
compared to the previous year), while the estimated employment generated amounted to around 8,100
workers. This figure confirms the Group’s key role in developing the local area.

Investments in innovation totalled approximately Euro 62.4 million for projects in four areas: smart city,
utility 4.0 and customer experience. The Group continued to develop customer relation digital channels in
2018. The new MyHera app was launched for residential customers which reached 100 thousand
downloads.

Air protection confirms its positive results thanks to the emissions of the Group’s ten waste-to-energy
plants: very low levels once again in 2018 and on average 86% lower than legal limits. Furthermore,
regarding soil protection, the planning implemented by HeraTech in 2018 reused 68% of total soil.

To conclude, also in the light of the positive results reported in this document, we can state that
sustainability reporting guarantees Hera Group’s well-known and consolidated “external” value, but at the
same time has paved the way, right from the very start, to creating a highly significant “internal” value. The
organisation has been able to develop significant cultural growth exactly on this latter aspect, with tangible
and gradual improvements in daily business management and in the relations it holds with stakeholders, by
effectively monitoring the company’s “what” and “how”. The new strategic approach to creating shared
value has smoothed the path to a new phase focusing on “why”. This has led us to renewing our reporting
and, in our opinion, will be able to sustain the future growth of our company.
