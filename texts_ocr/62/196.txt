The instrument envisages a coupon of 2.375% and a return on 2.436%. The orders received were mainly
taken from investors resident outside Italy (75%) with France, Germany and the UK which reported the
greatest percentages, and a predominance of asset managers. 69% of demand came from investors who
have Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) among their investment criteria, so-called “sustainable”
investors.

The Hera Group thus unveils, in Italy as well, a form of financing already used in Europe by other leading
utilities, which places funding at the service of the environment, with resources which will then be
specifically allocated to investments linked to improving the environmental performance in the area.

The list of the projects eligible for funding has been established by Hera on the basis of precise
environmental criteria and subsequently confirmed by DNV GL to ensure the correct allocation of the
funds. With regard to each sphere of the project, a set of indicators have been identified which reflect the
environmental benefits associated with the individual initiatives. These indicators are shown within

sections “Spreading renewable energy”, “Transition to a circular economy”, “Sustainable management of
water resources” and “Air and soil protection” in this Sustainability Report.

Downstream from the fund raising, 26 projects were financed/refinanced, belonging to the categories
indicated in the table presented above. Overall, projects financed reached Euro 500 million, covering the
entire amount of the bond.

Green bonds are those which associate environmental-type investments and activities with the funds
raised. The first financial instrument of this type was issued by the World Bank in 2008. Interest for green
bonds has grown over time and 2018 was a new record year in terms of number of issuers; in fact, green
bond issues in 2018 came to USS 167.3 billion, up 3% compared with last year.

In Italy, the Hera Group was the first to launch this new financial instrument (for an equivalent value of 500
million) and opened the way up for other operators in the utility sector or otherwise. The bond was very
successful, with applications for an equivalent value of around three times the amount of the bond.

The first sustainable revolving credit facility in Italy

In May 2018 a new credit facility was taken out for Euro 200 million, entitled “ESG Linked RCF Facility”,
which introduces elements of sustainability by means of an incentive mechanism linked to the achievement
of specific environmental, social and governance objectives. In the commitment undertaken with the
banks, a number of sustainability performance indicators have been defined, by virtue of which the
multiutility company may benefit over time by more favourable rates.
