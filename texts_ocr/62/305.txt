CSV Investments

Expansion of the Pesaro treatment plant
We signed the contract to award upgrade
works for the Borgheria treatment plant.
The work calls for an investment of more
than Euro 8 million. The measure will be
completed by 2021 and will increase
treatment effectiveness, ensuring full
compliance and responding to the EC
infringement proceedings.

New measures to deal with drought risk
The reconstruction work on the so-called
“wellhead” of the Burano well, in the
municipality of Cagli, a fundamental
strategic reserve, has been completed.
Drilling is underway in the municipality of
Fossombrone to find new supply sources.
Overall investment: more than Euro 3
million.
