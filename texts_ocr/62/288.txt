Tenders for contracts awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous bid
approach

The Hera Group Guidelines on procurement, since 2008, favour the economically most advantageous bid
method as the approach for assessing bids, using sustainability criteria consistent with the principles of the
Code of Ethics.

In the specific areas identified by the Guidelines, and in detail “respect for the environment”, “social

commitment”, “quality of services” and “economic value”, sustainability criteria have been defined on the

basis of the experience acquired in managing calls for tenders according to the most economically

advantageous bid method, of doctrine, of regulations on the matter and in line with Hera Group objectives.
