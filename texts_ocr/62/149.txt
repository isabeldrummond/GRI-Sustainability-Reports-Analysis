In 2018 the plants managed by Hera saved primary energy of 36,495 toe, slightly down compared to 2017
by 954 toe (2.5% less).

As for the sources used for district heating, the percentage of thermal energy produced with gas boilers
has gone down from 58% in 2005 to 31% in 2018. On the other hand, the production of thermal energy
from cogeneration decreased slightly compared to that produced by boilers because, as mentioned above,
in 2018 the combination of lower hourly value of electricity and the cost of gas made cogeneration operate
for a smaller number of hours and therefore it provided less thermal energy.
