e sending a welcome letter to residential and non-residential gas customers also for contracts
concluded in Hera Comm’s offices;

e = making withdrawal easier, by requiring an email, a normal letter or a fax (not just by registered
letter).

For Hera, it is fundamental to acquire the customer’s consent clearly, responsibly and unequivocally. To do
so we have added even more specific quality controls, in line with what is required by the Consumer Code:

e for contracts offered by phone, a second call must be made to check that the customer has
received the contract and actually wants to accept it, and to monitor, at the same time, the quality
of the sale effort carried out by our teleselling channel. In addition, the customer can retrieve the
telephone recording of their conversation via the web portal or automated phone system;

e for contracts proposed following a visit to the customer’s home, besides the welcome letter that
is sent to them, a phone call is made that assesses the quality of the sales channel and gives the
customer a chance to exercise their right to change their mind.

The continuous improvement of sales processes, together with the constant monitoring of sales channels,
led to significant results in 2018 in terms of complaints for unsolicited contracts. The number of complaints
fell by 50% to 47 contracts, compared with over 310,000 contracts concluded outside business premises. All
complaints for unsolicited contracts were accepted and 100% of the cases were subject to recovery
measures.

Cost of services

Hera manages service concessions and free market services. For the service concessions (integrated water
service, municipal waste, distribution of gas and electricity), the tariffs applied by Hera are regulated by the
regulatory authorities (ARERA and the local municipal waste authorities), while for free market services
(waste disposal, sales of gas and electricity), the tariffs are freely determined. On a quarterly basis, ARERA
defines and updates the prices for the sales tariffs to customers that have not subscribed to a free market
electricity service option and for residential gas customers that are under protective economic conditions.
