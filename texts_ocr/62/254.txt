To be effective when selecting the best talents available on the market, two distinct yet strongly interlaced
aspects need to be considered: the attractiveness of the Hera brand and the quality of the selection
process. From this point of view, the effectiveness and efficiency required to cover personnel needs must
include a good experience offered to candidates by the individuals in charge of selection.

The levers to strengthen both these aspects are: digitalisation, simplification, agility and people analytics. A
first important result in 2018 was the implementation of the new job application management system. On
the one hand, the system standardised the process, making it uniform and improving its effectiveness and
relevant monitoring; on the other, it made it easier to apply for a job, thanks above all to its easy access
(even from a smartphone) and its ability to automatically import data from applicants’ CV or Linkedin
profile. The new system was started in July 2018 and over 8,500 applications were registered in just a few
months. The independent analysis by Potentialpark - a market-leading research company that publishes an
annual ranking of companies that, through their online communication, are more attractive for job seekers
- was launched in September 2018. The result was first place in the “Applicant Tracking System” category
and second place in the “Mobile” category.

The Her@futura survey, already used for mapping the digital propensity of the entire corporate workforce,
was made available to applicants. The goal is to make a tool available to all persons interested in getting to
know Hera better. This tool increases individual awareness of the level of readiness to use new digital
working methods in an environment that runs the risk of creating a gap that is difficult to bridge between
individuals who already have specific skills and individuals who have not yet embarked on their digital
transformation journey. In just two months, over 700 applicants took part in the questionnaire and have
already received personal feedback. Furthermore, several studies show that the duration of acquired skills
wears away at in increasing pace over time and that, in order to continue to be effective in the business
world, it is ever more crucial to possess and develop learning agility. For this reason, all of our candidates
have the opportunity to take an aptitude test that examines relational aspects, the ability to work in a
team, result orientation, the propensity for innovation and critical thinking, as well as specific aspects
linked to learning agility.

The professional roles sought after are highly varied and balanced, with specialisations both with regard to
staff functions (e.g. procurement and contract regulatory experts, legal and personnel management
controllers and experts) and to marketing, sales and customer management (area managers, key account
managers, back office employees), operations (process engineers, plant managers and technical operators)
and information systems (functional analysts and systems engineers).

Briefly, the effects of the selection process contribute to the generational change (average age of 34 years
for new hires compared to 48 years of the Group) of the company workforce, to the increase in the number
of women (51% of hiring excluding blue-collar workers regarded women) and the percentage of graduates
(75% excluding operating profiles).

With respect to the channels used, 90% of selections are covered using internal tools with an average
selection process time of around 40 working days.

Effective selection must inevitably be accompanied by an equally effective and well-structured entry
programme. The aim is to support new hires entering the company through specifically dedicated actions
seeking to integrate them in the company environment and help them fully perform their role. The main
benefits are undoubtedly: better performance, strengthening employees’ sense of belonging and so a
greater ability to retain talent. For this reason, the programme for the entry of new hires in the company
was revised in 2018. New support tools were introduced: a handbook; a welcome letter from top
management and a welcome kit; structured listening and feedback with the respective manager to
stimulate dialogue, giving new hires the opportunity to play an active part in their growth in the company;
and the introduction of a “buddy”, a colleague who supports new hires in taking their first steps in the
