The initiatives launched by Herambiente in terms of material and energy recovery continued in 2018,
characterized by a strong acceleration in the process of transformation of its industrial activities in view of a
“circular economy”. In fact, 2018 was marked by three important and fundamental events that testify to
Herambiente’s ability to transform the principles underlying the concept of circular economy into facts:

¢ complete integration of the plastic recovery chain, from collection, selection and subsequent
recovery, through the synergies achieved following the acquisition, in 2017, of control (through an
80% stake) of the Aliplast Group, a leader in the production of rigid and flexible films;

¢ construction and start-up of a plant to produce biomethane from the organic fraction of separate
collected municipal waste;

e award of the contract, worth Euro 28.5 million, for the reclamation of the port of Chioggia.
Herambiente won the tender for the renovation of strategic areas related to this important
maritime port, qualified as a “Site of National Interest” (SNI).

In parallel with the three important initiatives described above, the constant development of
Herambiente’s plant pool continued, following these main guidelines:

e identification and implementation of solutions to efficiently produce and use electrical energy and
thermal energy in the sites where waste-to-energy plants and landfills with energy recovery are
located;

e implementation, in the liquid industrial waste segment, of technologies aimed at recovering,
rather than disposing of, organic water, solvents, sludge, etc.;

¢ modernization and upgrade of organic media composting and aerobic stabilization plants to align
all Herambiente Group plants to the best available technical standards and BATs (Best Available
Technologies);

e integration of the system linked to M&A operations, increasingly oriented towards market
segments related to industrial waste management and recovery and “full service” services at
production plants of medium to large sized companies operating in oil & gas, food & beverage,
large-scale retail, etc.;

¢ activities related to building new landfill volumes for non-recoverable fractions.

The recovery of material and energy in Herambiente’s selection plants

The selection plants treat the municipal and special waste coming from separate waste collection and from
industrial or artisan manufacturing in the province in which they are located. The objective of the process,
which uses more or less complex technologies and treatment lines according to the type of waste to be
treated, is to recover the greatest possible amount of material from the incoming flow and reduce reliance
on landfills. These systems recover: paper/cardboard, plastic, wood, metal, glass, biodegradable waste
(pruning material), tires, textiles, inert materials. The treatment lines used are specific to the characteristics
of each collection. Five of the 6 plants have computer vision systems that are particularly efficient in
selecting plastic and paper from municipal waste both in terms of flow (hourly quantity of waste treated)
and in terms of the quality of the material obtained by the selection.

The scrap of the treatment, the so-called non-reusable fractions and non-reusable material are dispatched
to be used for energy recovery or to be disposed of.

In 2018, Herambiente’s selection and recovery plants handled 425,775 tonnes of waste (+14.5%), the
quantity treated and sent for recovery of material was 73.6% of the incoming waste, the portion used for
energy recovery was 3.6%, for an overall recovery of 77.2%. The material recovery level confirms the
upward trend compared to previous years. A portion of the of non-reusable fractions is used for energy
recovery, about 13% in 2018. The project to implement crushing lines to increase the non-reusable
fractions for energy recovery is still under way, the crushing process was started up and became fully
operational in 2018 for the Granarolo plant, while the authorization process was started in Modena and we
