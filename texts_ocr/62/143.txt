commitment to environmental education for children, also offering access to major water and waste
treatment facilities. The main objective is to encourage young people to cultivate a responsible attitude
towards the environment and the rational use of resources.

In the case of Marche Multiservizi, 11 schools, 40 teachers and 1,030 students were involved, a significant
increase compared to the previous year (+74.9%). Marche Multiservizi promotes environmental education
projects throughout its area, in order to raise awareness in the school world on issues related to services
and act upon information processes, also by providing business expertise. This year, the main activities
focused on organising the Festival of Reuse and Recycling, the goal of which is to continue to raise
awareness among citizens, especially young people, on the importance of reducing the consumption of raw
materials and the production of waste by reusing goods and materials. The event, accredited by the
European Community and the Ministry of the Environment, is part of the initiatives of the National Festival
of Sustainable Development 2018, one of the main Italian contributions to the “European Week of
Sustainable Development”, during which events were held (exhibitions/shows/book
presentations/demonstrations local promotion) to draw attention to the 17 objectives of sustainable
development of Agenda 2030. The event was held at the Reuse area in Marche Multiservizi, from 28 May to
1 June 2018, and was attended by about 800 students from secondary and high schools. The students of
the Genga-Bramante Institute in Pesaro also provided their support. Marche Multiservizi provided its
support with training activities, distributing information material and organizing plant visits.

The collaboration with the Gulliver non-profit organisation has continued to prepare the Festival 2019. An
interesting environmental education project was presented (launched in 2019) supported by Coop. IDEA
that created the Museum of the Recyclosaurs. Lastly, training sessions on the topic of water were held for
the inaugurations of the Water Houses at Montelabbate and Pesaro. Before the ribbon was cut, children
met in classrooms to learn about the water cycle, from collection to its return to the environment.

Atmospheric emissions of waste-to-energy plants

All Hera Group waste-to-energy plants are equipped with fume purification and process and emission
control systems, designed and built so as to attain:

e high fume purification performance in all process conditions;
e high operational versatility;
e high reliability of emission control systems.

In order to meet these goals, the new plants and those that have been renovated (Modena, Bologna,
Ferrara, Forli, and Rimini) are equipped with the following systems:

e double reaction and filtration system to lower the concentrations of particulate, hydrochloric acid,
hydrofluoric acid, sulphur dioxide, heavy metals, dioxins and furans and aromatic polycyclic
hydrocarbons (the Modena plant has a bag filter and an electrostatic precipitator);

e double reaction system (catalytic and non-catalytic) to reduce concentrations of nitrogen oxides;

e double fume monitoring system for process control: the two systems measure the concentrations
of the main pollutants from the oven and downstream of the first reaction and filtration phase, on
the basis of which a calculation is made of the volume of reactants required to ensure purification
levels that ensure compliance with for statutory emission thresholds and which are, on average,
80-90% below these;

¢ continuous double monitoring system for chimney emissions: one as a reserve for the other in
order to ensure the continuity of the analysis of concentrations in atmospheric emissions.

The possibility of using double purification and monitoring systems in series (in parallel as regards chimney
monitoring) allows the above objectives to be successfully pursued.
