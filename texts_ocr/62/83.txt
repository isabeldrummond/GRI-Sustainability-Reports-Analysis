Sustainable management of water resources

Water supply sources

Hera Group’s water supply sources include underground water, surface water and, to a lesser extent,
springs. In Romagna, the distributed water is purchased wholesale from Romagna Acque — Societa delle
Fonti.

The complexity of drinking water purification processes varies depending on the quality of the source
water: they range from advanced chemical and physical processes, usually used for surface water, to
simpler filtration and disinfection treatments for water coming from deep wells and springs that is already
of good quality when collected.

The treatments carried out ensure that the product we distribute has suitable chemical physical and
microbiological features for human consumption, and is constantly compliant with the limits laid down by
current regulations.

Figures concern both the civil and the industrial aqueduct networks (the latter being present in the Forli-Cesena,
Imola-Faenza, Modena and Ravenna areas, and account for around 3% of the total).

The data provided shows a total volume of water fed into the network slightly down compared to 2017 (-
1.9%), and in line with 2016. The mix of supply sources is substantially unchanged. The less dry period of
2018, compared to 2017, however led to a greater rebalancing of sources with less use of groundwater (-
6.4%) compared to 2017. From a geographical point of view, the share of groundwater is lowest in the
Marche Multiservizi area (19%), while it is predominant in the Triveneto area (85%).

Limiting the analysis to domestic consumption in Emilia-Romagna only, it is interesting to note that in the
2008-2017 period the water sold decreased significantly, by 7.0%.
