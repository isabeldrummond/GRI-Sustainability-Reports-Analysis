In 2018, the average family spent a total of Euro 1,540 on the services supplied by Hera, 2.0% more than in
2017, amounting to about Euro 30. In particular, the increase in gas and electricity bills was affected by the
increase in the share of raw materials (up by Euro 37) compared with last year. There was a Euro 2 increase
in taxes, duties and charges, particularly VAT, as a direct consequence of the increase in the share of raw
materials, partly offset by the reduction in water and electricity consumption. Water services, on the other
hand, decreased by Euro 14 compared with 2017, due to a decrease in the share attributable to Hera (down
Euro 13) as a result of the adjustments applied in 2018, and to a reduction in taxes, duties and charges also
linked to a reduction in the volumes of water consumed. Lastly, the decline in the waste bill is mainly due to
the trend in the municipality of Ferrara as a result of the application of the quantity-based tariff method,
which rewards virtuous households that properly separate their waste.

45% of overall spending, amounting to Euro 694 (47% in the previous year), is attributable to the
components of bills pertaining to Hera. In 2018, this share decreased by around Euro 9, broken down as
follows: Euro +3 for gas, Euro +3 for electricity, Euro -13 for water and Euro -2 for waste.

Based on an analysis considering equal volumes used by an average Hera customer, for 2018, the overall
cost of services increased by 3.8%, amounting to about Euro 75, compared to 2017. This result is due to:

e an almost Euro 65 increase of the cost of raw materials and generation, directly related to fuel
price trends;

e a Euro 2.5 increase of the bill components attributable to Hera. This increase is equal to 0.1% of the
total amount of the bills considered: it is due to increases of Euro 6 for the electricity service, Euro
3 for the gas service and a decrease of Euro 4 for the water service and Euro 2.5 for the waste
service for the reasons mentioned above;

e an increase of Euro 8 in taxes, duties, system charges and other charges not attributable to Hera as
a result of the effects of the two previous points.
