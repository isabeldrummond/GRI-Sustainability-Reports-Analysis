have made it possible to reduce the need to supply tanks in the mountains using tanker trucks (down by
40% in the summer of 2017 compared to 2012, the most recent significant drought). In Romagna, where
Hera operates mainly as a distributor, Romagna Acque Societa delle Fonti built the “Standiana” drinking
water plant (capable of treating a flow of 1100 I/sec) in the Ravenna area in response to the problem of
water reserves on the Adriatic coast, a major tourist destination, supplementing the Ridracoli feeding
system. In any case, in the Romagna area, the measures Hera has implemented in recent years
(interconnections, upgrading of pumps and implementation of the remote control system) have also
mitigated the problems caused by the dry summer.

During 2018, the network districtisation and active search for losses continued throughout the area,
together with a plan to replace pipelines and connections, increasingly governed by criteria for analysing
and interpreting the available data, which can be traced back to physical factors of the aqueduct
infrastructure (material, diameter, age of the pipeline, etc.) and to environmental factors (type of soil,
climatic aspects understood as precipitation rather than external temperature).

In this regard, in 2018 Hera, with the support of the University of Bologna, launched a study to investigate
the factors that influence the probability of failure, developing guided models that focus precisely on the
relevance of climatic factors on the probability of occurrence of the failure event.

This project is part of a broader range of joint actions and strategies involving the various stakeholders
(managers, environmental planners, environmental bodies and control bodies), as was explained in detail in
the conference promoted by Hera in July 2018. Its purpose is to fight the breakdown of aqueduct networks
in relation to the efficient use of water resources and climate change in progress.

Non-invoiced water

The percentage of non-invoiced water compared to water fed into the network is related to physical or real
losses (due to breakage of pipes or hydraulic equipment, etc.) or procedural or apparent losses (metering
inaccuracies, errors in estimated presumed consumption at 31 December, unrecorded internal
consumption, and illegal use). The latter losses result in water which is effectively delivered to the final
customer but is not recorded and invoiced.

Until 2006, network losses were calculated as the difference between the water fed into the aqueduct
network during the year and the water accounted for as supplied to customers during the same period: the
amount was estimated at 31 December of every year on the basis of the historical consumption of
customers since it is not possible to take a single reading at 31 December of all the meters. This estimate
was then supplemented so as to take into account the correct period of recording in accounts of the water
sold to customers as at 31 December of the previous year, calculated after reading all the meters. Since
2007, network losses have been calculated by integrating the adjustments coming from meter readings in
the pertinent year, thereby ensuring perfect comparability between water sold and the related amounts
fed into the system each year. With this approach, it is possible to calculate the final figure for the year only
around 4-6 months after the close of the financial statements, after all the meters have been read. For this
reason, the table below does not include the provisional figures for 2018. On the basis of the information
available at the date of approval of this Sustainability Report, there is no evidence to suggest that the final
figure for non-invoiced water for 2018 differs significantly from that for 2017.

At Group level, network losses for 2017 were 30.6%, in line with 2016 (both data calculated according to
ARERA’s new resolution). The Group continues to rank significantly below the national average of 41.9% in
2015 (Source: ARERA, 2018 Annual report) and the 36% average of the provincial capitals (Source:
Legambiente, 2018 Urban Ecosystem).

The corresponding line loss index for 2017 is 10.2 m?/km/day, substantially in line with 2016. We believe
that the figure of non-invoiced water per kilometre of network is more representative of the effectiveness
and efficiency of the distribution system and more useful for comparison with other companies. The figure
