2015/1127 of 10 July 2015; with a measure of the Ministry of the Environment (Decree 134 of 19 May
2016). The factor has therefore been implemented, so the coefficient has been reduced from 1.38 to 1.25.
The plants of the Herambiente group retain the R1 qualification they have acquired.

This plant network makes it possible to manage the flows of non-separate municipal waste beyond the so-
called municipal-derived waste in the region, so that in the event of a shut-down of the reference plant,
this waste can be sent, either in full or in part, to the closest energy recovery plant, thus limiting the use of
landfills and, by doing so, pursuing the objectives set by European and national regulations on the hierarchy
of waste treatment. For example, if the Coriano (RN) plant were to shut down or the quantities of waste
produced were to exceed its treatment capacity — as often occurs during peak tourism periods — the non-
separate municipal waste collected in the province of Rimini could be sent to the closest available plants
(e.g. Ravenna or Forli) for energy recovery and no longer disposed of in landfills.

Concerning the performance assessment of in terms of efficiency, there are two “structural” aspects. The
first concerns the process related to the conversion of energy released by the combustion of waste, the
second to the external users that can make productive use of the waste heat generated by the combustion.
In the first case, the assessment is plant related: The heat generated by combustion of the waste is used to
produce steam, and depending on its characteristics (pressure and temperature) achieves different
performance of the steam turbine, (the higher the temperature of the steam, the greater the efficiency of
the cycle). The choice to opt for more or less advanced solutions takes into account not only performance
but also economic factors (for example, to work with steam temperatures particular attention must be paid
to the issue of acid corrosion of the pipes in which the steam flows, which increases costs due to a greater
thickness of the pipes needed or due to coating them with protective materials such as Inconel, effective
against corrosion but very expensive) and management factors (for example, work in more critical
conditions may result in the need to increase both the duration and the frequency of ordinary and
extraordinary maintenance).

In the second case, finally, it is necessary to assess the capability of recovering the waste heat produced by
the combustion processes. The greater the ability to recover this waste by users outside the waste-to-
energy plant, the greater the plant’s efficiency, also in terms of the R1 index.

Lastly, waste-to-energy plants not only ensure significant energy recovery (electrical and thermal), but also
produce heavy slag (called IBA, Incinerator Bottom Ash), for which there are well-established recovery
processes whereby the slag is sent to organizations that work in this specific sector, as reported below in
this section of the Sustainability Report. Therefore, waste-to-energy plants not only guarantee energy
recovery but also contribute significantly to the recovery of building materials from the point of view of a
circular economy.

The “Sblocca Italia” Decree and the new regulations on waste disposal

Art. 35 of Legislative Decree 133/2014, converted, with amendments, into Law 164/2014, the so-called
“Sblocca Italia” law, aims to develop a suitable, integrated system at national level to manage municipal
waste and to meet the separate waste collection and recycling objectives.

This objective is also aimed at guaranteeing national safety in terms of self-sufficiency and, as a result,
circumventing and preventing additional violations due to failure to comply with European regulations in
the sector. One of its key aims is to reduce the disposal of waste in landfills. In this context, the use of
waste-to-energy technology, an alternative to landfill disposal, represents a solution to the various
sanctions imposed on Italy by the European Court of Justice, the last of which, totalling Euro 42.8 million for
every six months of non-compliance, was applied in December 2014 due to the ongoing non-compliance
with the European Directive of the authorizations of 198 landfills in Italy.

The Italian Prime Minister’s Decree of 10 August 2016 implements the principles and objectives of art. 35,
as it identifies the overall capacity of the treatment plants of waste-to-energy plants at national level, and
as a result identifies within macro-areas of Italy the residual requirement to be covered by building waste-
to-energy plants.
