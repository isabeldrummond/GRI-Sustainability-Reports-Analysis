After the revamping, the electrical output will be 3,800 kWh/h, for a total annual output of 29.3
GWh, compared with the current figure of about 20.7 GWh.

The revamping of the line also includes work on the boiler and on the thermal cycle (recovery of
the process heat) that will increase the average steam production while increasing the plant’s
overall energy efficiency. In order to maintain a high level of protection of the atmosphere media,
the project envisages significant improvements to the flue gas purification section, and the
installation of an emission monitoring system (EMS) on the newly constructed chimney. The system
will measure flow rate, temperature, pressure, concentration of particulates, oxygen, Total Organic
Carbon, hydrochloric acid, sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
ammonia, hydrofluoric acid, and mercury, pollutants that are critical for the Padania area.

In the light of the design methods applied in accordance with the sector’s best practices, no
impacts were found for the environmental media that require mitigation or compensation works. In
particular, in relation to the atmosphere media, potentially more affected by the revamping,
simulations were carried out to estimate the dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere and their
precipitation to the ground. These simulations showed that, overall, the impact on air quality can
be assessed as insignificant. A further assessment concerned the determination of the emission
balance, in relation to the typical pollutants of the Po Valley area such as NO, and particulate, and
showed that the project will significantly reduce the mass flows of these pollutants and
consequently reduce the impact on the atmosphere.

In accordance with the regulations on Environmental Impact Assessment, the following environmental
screening procedures were carried out in 2018.

Optimization of the secondary solid fuel production plant at the selection and recovery plant in
the Municipality of Castiglione delle Stiviere (MN)

The project presented includes some new machinery on the existing secondary solid fuel
production line. Remaining unchanged the quantities and types of incoming waste authorized to
date, the main objective of the proposed changes is to optimize the production process to improve
the quality of the CSS end product and increase its production at the expense of the average size in
that line, with the possibility of obtaining also a secondary solid fuel that, if compliant with the
criteria set out in Ministerial Decree 22/2013, pursuant to art. 184 ter of Legislative Decree 152/06
as amended, will cease being waste (End of Waste).

We carried out specific assessments on the potential impacts of the planned work, particularly
concerning the noise generated by the new machinery on the secondary solid fuel production line.
The noise impact assessment reported that the limits at the receptors were respected.

The potential impact on surface water and groundwater media, soil and subsoil was assessed in
relation to the provision of a new external storage area (about 700 m?) for waste packaged in bales
to be sent to the various destination facilities. In order to protect these environmental media, the
area was identified on the existing yard, already paved and waterproofed, served by the plant’s
sewage system that conveys rainwater to the first flush rainwater tank. In relation to the
atmosphere, the planned work will not add points of atmospheric emission, nor involve changes to
the existing abatement system and the corresponding point of emission. As for the current
machines, the new ones will be equipped with special localized aspiration ducts, conveyed to the
current abatement system that is already adequately sized. The packaging of the waste stored
outside into film-coated bales will also prevent wind dispersion. Lastly, in accordance with the
provisions of Lombardy Regional Authority Decision 4792 of 08/02/2016, a special section of the
preliminary environmental study was prepared to assess the project’s compliance with the
international, national and regional planning acts in the field of public health. This analysis did not
find any elements that hinder the completion of the planned works.
