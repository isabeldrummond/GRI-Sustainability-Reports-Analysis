Ri eawater Protection Plan

Created in 2014 to eliminate swimming
bans and reduce by 90% the polluting
impact of rainwater discharged into the
sea, and supplemented by 3 measures to
ensure flood safety, the Plan includes 14
measures, 7 of which were completed by
the end of 2018. We freed over 3 km of
beach from swimming bans, set to
increase to 4 at end of 2019

CSV Case Study

More separate waste collection with
quantity-based tariff;

In Cattolica, Coriano and Misano Adriatico,
in order to start applying the quantity-
based tariff that measures the quantities
of waste disposed of, new systems have
been introduced for collection of street
waste bins, which can be accessed with a
special card or door-to-door with
containers or bags equipped with tags.
Over 50 thousand residents are involved
(16% of the total)

 

Over 3,000 people for recovery of cooking
oil

The campaign to increase the collection of
used cooking oil, for which 50 additional
road containers were added, involved
more than 3,000 people in 14 public
meetings. Thanks to an agreement
between Hera and Eni, the oil is
transformed into biofuel and will power
part of our company’s fleet.
