Aliplast’s integrated system

The Aliplast Group, that Herambiente acquired in 2017, has 9 plants. The 4 foreign plants located in Spain,
Poland and France, and the 2 Italian plants, at Formigine (MO) and Quinto di Treviso (TV), are engaged in
the selection and procurement of plastic. The Ospedaletto di Istrana (TV) and Borgolavezzaro (NO) plants
transform waste plastic into finished products, while the Gualdo Cattaneo (PG) plant produces finished
products from semi-finished recycled plastic products.

Aliplast manages the integrated plastic cycle, transforming waste into finished products, mainly PE films,
PET plate and granules/flakes of the leading polymers. Its main commitment is to make the plastic life-cycle
sustainable, by collecting and recycling plastic to produce new materials, with the lowest possible
environmental impact. Focusing on constant research, development and technological innovation
(regarding products, services and processes), Aliplast manages a traceable plastics production chain, which
is capable of transforming a disjoined chain into a virtuous circle and of ensuring high quality final products
that are efficient and economically more convenient than traditional materials.
