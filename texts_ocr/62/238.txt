indicators have been set for each area served by Inrete by ARERA’s 702/2016/R/eel resolution, applicable
to this regulatory period (2016-2023). The trend levels assigned by ARERA were respected in 2016.

In 2017, resolution 605/2018 awarded Inrete a total of around Euro 857 thousand as incentives related to
continuity recoveries of the electricity distribution service and issued penalties for around Euro 55
thousand. By 30 November 2019, the Italian regulatory authority will publish the results achieved by the
distribution companies in 2018 which, for Inrete Distribuzione Energia, are expected to amount to
incentives of around Euro 380 thousand.

AcegasApsAmga also takes part in the incentive and penalty system for continuity recoveries related to the
electricity distribution service, set forth in resolution ARG/elt646/15. In 2018, based on the quantity and
duration of outages without advance notice in 2017 as reference, the entitlement to two incentives for the
two areas for a total of about Euro 270 thousand was obtained.

The average figure applies to power cuts of the low voltage service, without advance notice and due to causes for
which the operator is responsible. The power-cut duration minutes refer to power cuts that last more than 3 minutes.
The 2017 trend is the objective of the indicator for 2016-2017. The trend level for the number of power cuts in low
concentration areas is 4.30 for Imola-Faenza and 5.19 for Modena compared to the final values of 2.50 and 6.15.

The 2018 figure confirms the good level of continuity of the electricity distribution service and, for all the
reference indicators, is below the trend and/or target levels set by ARERA.

The number of requests for connection to the distribution network operated by Inrete in 2018 showed an
overall slight increase compared to 2017 of about 5.5%, despite a decrease for medium voltage requests of
37%. Input power decreased by about 17% compared to 2017.

Gas distribution service safety and continuity

The Hera Group manages the gas distribution service with the objective of ensuring high safety and service
continuity levels.

The network classified as having a high probability of dispersion is meant as the sum of:

e high pressure network;
e network made of non-compliant materials as required by ARERA’s Resolution;
e network laid in areas subject to hydrogeological instability.

For this type of network, 100% of the network must be inspected annually.
The resolution mentioned above governs the quality of the gas distribution service, and has further

increased the safety standards for the current regulatory period (2014-2019). This rise was substantially in
