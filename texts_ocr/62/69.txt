¢ management — where possible — of certain flows as recoverable by-products rather than waste for
disposal;
onsite management of plants.

Many client companies that subscribe to the Global Waste Management offer, in fact, have their own
private plants for the treatment of certain scrap from their production processes: Herambiente Servizi
industriali has started to offer these customers a service that manages this type of systems, aimed at
optimizing them. The integration of our Waste Management services with those of on-site Systems
Management helps the Group be effective and well known in the market, encourages customer loyalty and
creates value, besides being a factor that sets it apart from its competitors.

HASI managed over 484 thousand tonnes of industrial waste in 2018, of which 42% was sent for material
or energy recovery, a very positive figure, considering that in 2016 the recovery rate was around 25%. This
reflects the orientation of the business strategy to increase the recovery rate of industrial waste through
commercial development integrated with circular economy solutions, as described above. The data confirm
the potential of the offer, with a 60% recovery of material and energy from managed waste for Global
Waste Management customers. During the year, also for SMEs, the offer increasingly focused on proposing
recovery solutions, as shown by the positive results.

The objective for 2019 is to increase the recovery rate of industrial waste through a commercial
development integrated with circular economy solutions expanding the offer with additional services and
integrated solutions in terms of environmental sustainability, such as the supply of renewable energy,
energy/thermal efficiency and water cycle efficiency, in synergy with other Group companies.
