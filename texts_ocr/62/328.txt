Q Audit & Assurance
= for the following companies and sites, which we selected on the basis of their activities, their contribution
to the performance indicators at consolidated level and their location, we carried out on-site visits, during
which we met local management and gathered supporting documentation regarding the compliance with
procedures and calculation methods used for the key performance indicators: Hera S.p.A. Bologna Head
Office, Imola (BO) site, Granarolo dell'Emilia (BO) site, Modena site, Forli site, Ferrara site, Ferrara and
Imola plants; Hera Trading S.r.l. Imola (BO) site; Inrete Distribuzione Energia S.p.A. Bologna site,
Uniflotte S.r.1. Bologna site, Hera Comm S.r.1. Imola (BO) site, Herambiente S.p.A. Bologna site, Rimini
site; Frullo Energia Ambiente S.r.1. Granarolo dell'Emilia (BO) plant; AcegasApsAmga S.p.A. and
AcegasApsAmga Servizi Energetici S.p.A. Padua site, Trieste site; Marche Multiservizi S.p.A. Pesaro site.

Conclusion
Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that caused us to believe that the NFD of the
Hera Group as of 31 December 2018 and for the year then ended has not been prepared, in all material respects,
in compliance with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI Standards.
