Methodological guide to the Report

This document represents Hera Group’s Consolidated non-financial reporting (CNFR). It reports — to the
extent necessary to ensure understanding of Hera’s business activity — on its performance, its results and
the impact it has on the issues considered relevant and referred to in Art. 3 and 4 of Italian Leg. Decree No.
254/16 with reference to financial year 2018. In order to define the aspects relevant to the Group and its
stakeholders, a structured materiality analysis process was carried out which is described in the paragraph
“Definition of contents” of this methodological guide to the Report.

As established by Art. 5 of Italian Leg. Decree 254/16, this document forms a separate report and is marked
with specific wording in order to connect it to the Non-Financial reporting required by law.

Hera Group considers its sustainability report as a primary tool for managing and reporting its activities
and results in the economic, environmental and social fields, as well as a fundamental tool for providing
information to and dialoguing with its stakeholders.

The Sustainability Report has been drawn up and published yearly since 2002. Since 2007, it has been
approved by the Board of Directors of Hera S.p.A. when the annual and consolidated financial statements
are approved and has been submitted to the Shareholders’ Meeting. This edition was approved by the
Board of Directors of Hera S.p.A. on 27 March 2019. This aspect demonstrates the central role of
sustainability and corporate social responsibility in Hera Group’s planning and control system, which
anticipated the obligations introduced by the European directive on non-financial reporting by more than
10 years.

The document is widely disseminated to all of the Group’s internal and external stakeholders through
publication on the company’s website and presentation to all Group workers.

In addition to the performances and goals achieved, the sustainability report provides the principles which
guide Hera Group’s actions, the future objectives, the results of its dialogue with stakeholders and its
existing initiatives. Special focus was given to case studies: projects that demonstrate the Group’s
commitment towards social responsibility and the creation of shared value and the results achieved in
these spheres.

The structure of the sustainability report is the direct consequence of the strategic approach to shared
value that Hera Group has adopted since 2016 to respond more effectively to the challenges of sustainable
economic development at global and local level, and to make the value generated through the local area
more tangible.

The glossary in the appendix explains the technical terms used, while the analytical list of contents makes
it easier to read the document.
