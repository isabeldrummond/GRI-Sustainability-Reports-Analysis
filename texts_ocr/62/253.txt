The hours of absence per capita are substantially in line with the last three years. Even in 2018 overtime
hours continued to represent a small percentage of the total hours worked and the per capita average
continued to decline. The “other” item in the table mainly refers to leave requested to assist family
members with disabilities or illness, leave for medical check-ups and therapy, and leave for academic
purposes.

The selection and onboarding process

Changes in business models, technological development and socio-demographic and economic factors are
altering the employment scenario with consequences that are not always predictable, but that a company
is forced to handle. This is why, over the next years, we expect new jobs to be created, others to disappear,
the skills required in existing jobs to evolve and, more generally, a new way of working.
