bodies despite the presence of conduct of the Hera Group compliant with the provisions of the law. This
risk profile pertains to the degrees of discretionality for the launch of verification/investigation procedures
within the sphere of regulations implementing the sector norms which are partially lacking or interpretative
stances of the prescriptions which are absent and equivocal. With regard to significant risks, mention is also
made of the economic-financial risk deriving from highly critical seismic events.

The described activities guarantee an effective control of all the main risks to which the Group is potentially
exposed, as well as the management of the Group’s overall exposure in keeping with the views expressed
in the Group’s risk appetite and with the Business Plan objectives.

During 2018, the ERM analysis carried out further method-related streamlining and analysis:

e the backtesting of the ERM analysis was carried out relating to the previous year, aimed at
evaluating the coherence of the impacts effectively suffered with respect to those estimated and
the observance of the limit of risk of variability of the profitability assigned, in the event of
realisation of the scenario assessed in the analysis. The internalisation of the effects of these
scenarios was also checked if they should lead to impacts within the plan duration;

e initiatives were carried out to improve the resilience of the Group in the face of risks which may
compromise the continuity of the significant activities of the group, in particular:

e within the sphere of waste collection and road sweeping services by means of the
identification of operational continuity strategies in the presence of unavailability of
vehicles;

e within the remote heating sphere, launching specific vulnerability analyses on the main
networks.

These activities will continue during 2019.

e in-depth analysis was carried out on the supply chain control system structured within the sphere
of the certified management systems with a view to the ERM assessment and identification of
significant risk scenarios. In collaboration with the Procurement and Tenders Department, the
significant risk scenarios and factors inherent to the process were identified, the assignment of the
impacts on the significant stakeholders was carried out, and the outstanding safeguards and the
associated risk were assessed;

e activities were launched at the beginning of 2019 aimed at identifying the degree of resilience of
the water distribution infrastructures in the presence of prolonged drought scenarios associated
with climate change.

On 10 January 2019, the Board of Directors was presented with the fourth ERM report; the risk limits for
2019 were also approved, as well as the up-date of the Hera Group risk management policy Guidelines.

The nature of risks and their management

The risks related to the business in which Hera operates and manages from an Enterprise Risk Management
perspective are related to the following risk areas, classified as internal, strategic and external, based upon
the risk model adopted by the Hera Group.

1. Internal risks

Nature: risks related to various types of risks - such as operational, organisational and ICT risks - are
specifically related to the management of services which employ human, technological and environmental
resources, and which can cause service interruptions, delays in the construction of new facilities or in the
delivery of services, fraud, intrusions, accidents and disasters.

Activity areas: the risks belonging to this driver cut across the Group and regard a wide range of activities
that are controlled and managed by specialist teams. The Group gives special focus to workplace safety, to
compliance of plant and site operation with environmental legislation and to ICT risk control, especially
