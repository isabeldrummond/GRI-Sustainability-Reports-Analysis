the stakeholders and the corporate governance, obtain significantly higher results than their competitors
over the long-term.

Hera stock joins the FTSE Mib index

Borsa Italiana has officialised the entry of Hera stock in the FTSE Mib index, the stock market index of the
40 leading companies in terms of capitalisation and liquidity. Hera has been able to achieve this prestigious
goal, thanks to both the achievement of 27th position in the ranking of the capitalisations of the Italian
companies and to the increase in the equivalent value of the trading (+52% in the first two months of 2019
compared with the average in 2018), further to the presentation of the new business plan.

Corporate Governance and safeguards for shareholders

Since its establishment, the Group has adopted a Corporate Governance system based on the traditional
model, which envisages a Board of Directors made up of executive and independent directors, for ensuring
in line with the company mission, the protection of the shareholders, the return on invested capital for
shareholders and satisfying the stakeholder interests.

Hera’s activities are handled by management in compliance with the Code of Ethics adopted by the Group,
whose last review was approved by the Board of Directors on 15 February 2017, and aligned with the Code
of Conduct promoted by Borsa Italiana S.p.A.

Hera’s management body has always been heedful of aspects of good governance and protection of the
interests of the shareholder: any change to its structure which meets these objectives is promptly adopted
without delay.

With this intention, in 2015 the loyalty vote was established, an instrument which makes it possible to
assign up to two votes for each share held by the same shareholder for a period of at least 24 months.
Shareholders who demonstrate - with the stability of their investment - a greater sensitivity to the long-
term growth of the Group and to the active participation in the appointment of the shareholders’
representatives, are thus rewarded. In order to fully safeguard the interests of the minorities, the
increased/loyalty vote was applied in a reduced version with respect to that envisaged by legislation: in
fact, it has exclusive efficacy for the appointment and/or removal of the Board of Directors and the Board
of Statutory Auditors, for the changing of the limit to share possession, and for the amendment of the same
article which established the increased or loyalty vote.

During the same meeting which established the loyalty vote, the shareholders also approved the increase

from three to four of the number of board directors appointed from the lists presented by the minorities:
