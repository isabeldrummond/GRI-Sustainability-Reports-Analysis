The social and environmental sustainability objectives set out in this report were defined with reference
to the planning and control instruments used by the Group: 2018-2022 Business Plan, 2019 budget and
2019 balanced scorecard. These interconnected instruments contain sustainability objectives which have
an impact on stakeholders. In particular, the Business Plan includes sustainability-related indicators for
which quantitative targets have been defined.

The collation and the consolidation of the information and data presented in the report took place, for the
first year, by means of the use of dedicated software: the data and the information for 2018 were directly
input via the software by the contact individuals and were subsequently validated by the designated
managers in the internal procedure.

Any changes in calculations compared to previous years are suitably indicated in a note accompanying the
tables.

Definition of contents

Sustainability reporting is preceded annually by the analysis and identification of relevant topics for the
stakeholders and for the Hera Group.

The process for defining the material topics is based on the analysis of internal and external documents
which brings to light the most relevant topics related to the shared value and sustainability, which the
reporting must focus on.

The external context pertaining to the three drivers identified for the creation of the shared value was first
of all analysed. For each driver, global, European, national and local policies were analysed in-depth to
define the priorities for change towards sustainability; this involved 63 policies, including the 2030 UN
Agenda, in relation to which the commitments and the most significant quantitative targets for Hera’s
activities were considered.

Then the Business Plan was considered, the analysis of the risk, the measures for involving the stakeholders
(the work of 2 HeraLABs carried out during the year in the areas of Ferrara and Ravenna), the annual
customer satisfaction survey, the biennial internal climate survey, feedbacks from the meetings with the
Auditors carried out by the Area Managers), the press review and the presence on social media, together
with the main legislative innovations.

HeraLABs have the task of proposing initiatives to involve stakeholders and improve the sustainability of
the services offered in the local areas, while verifying their efficacy periodically. In the first meeting of each
LAB, the topics of relevance for the local area are identified by using a specific method. In the following
meetings, the participants in the LAB propose and discuss initiatives for improving the impacts on those
significant aspects identified in the first meeting. The topics that had a high relevance assessment (defined
in terms of interest and conflict) by the 2 HeraLABs were:

=~ quality and consumption of the mains water;
© water: savings and reuse;

e the investments in the water service;

e the handling of waste serving the circular economy;
¢ ~quantity-based tariff;

¢ support of users in need;

e service quality;

e diffusion of innovation and digitalisation;

e value for the local area;

e spreading renewable energy;

e sustainability of the coastal area.

Regarding the press review, the presence of information regarding the Hera Group was analysed in the
leading local and national newspapers by highlighting the topics that showed greater visibility (whether
