During 2018, the Hera Group participated in the Industry 4.0 Competence Center coordinated by the
University of Bologna and aimed at carrying out research, development and technology transfer projects
through a partnership between public and private entities, as well as the development of orientation and
training activities on innovation. The project led to establishing the BI-REX Consortium which brings
together 57 parties including universities, research centres and companies and which relies on ministerial
funding and funding by private partners to pursue their goals.

Also as the part of HerAcademy, a memorandum of understanding was signed with H-Farm, the largest
European innovation centre, designed to develop a partnership for implementing innovation, digital and
circular economy projects especially for students, employees and employees’ children.

Agreements with universities, business schools and research centres

The Hera Group - through its Corporate University HerAcademy - has entered into several framework
agreements over the past years with leading universities in the Emilia-Romagna area, such as the University
of Bologna, the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, and the University of Ferrara, which include the
assignment of six-monthly scholarships for final year students and for recent graduates. The Group also
works actively with various business schools including the Bologna Business School (BBS), the Consorzio
MIB School of Management in Trieste, ISTAO (Adriano Olivetti Institute), the MIP-Polytechnic in Milan and
the SAFE Study and Research Centre; it is also a member of the Assoknowledge-Confindustria scientific
committee - Innovative and Technological Services.

Furthermore, scientific cooperation with the University of Milan — Bicocca and CRISP (Inter-university
Research Centre for Public Utility Services) continued, with the general aim of supporting the development
and implementation of activities within HerAcademy. During 2018, the Group also took part in the Industry
4.0 Competence Center coordinated by the University of Bologna and aimed at carrying out research,
development and technology transfer projects through a partnership between public and private entities,
as well as the development of orientation and training activities on innovation. Finally, also as the part of
HerAcademy, a memorandum of understanding was signed with H-Farm, the largest European innovation
centre, designed to develop a partnership for implementing innovation, digital and circular economy
projects especially for students, employees and employees’ children.

Development of the individuals

The development process

People are the true asset to achieve differentiation and competitive advantage: the quality and efficiency of
both internal processes and results depend on people. Effective personnel management and human capital
enhancement is therefore of strategic importance for the Group.

The development process is based on the evaluation of performance and managerial skills. It is applied
consistently throughout the company: it involves over 5,000 people including employees, management
employees, middle managers and managers. A distinguishing aspect is the dialogue on performance: a
“two-way” exchange between manager and employee, where the duty to provide clarity and effectiveness
by managers is accompanied by the commitment of each individual to use the feedback as an ongoing
learning tool. This increasingly positive experience has led to a growing ability to assess oneself and others,
while also showing the desire for reciprocal listening and the request for feedback for individual and
professional growth.

In 2018, 5,078 workers were assessed.

Within the development process, the definition of individual development actions is of key importance.
Starting from dialogue between managers and their workers, they are defined on the basis of a portfolio of
carefully planned and developed initiatives which are subsequently monitored and updated.
