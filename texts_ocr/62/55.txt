the Forli area). At the provincial level, the percentage of separate waste collection reaches 87% in Ferrara,
65% in the provinces of Modena and Rimini, and 60% in the province of Bologna (up 7.7 percentage points
compared to 2017). The remaining provinces still exceed 55.5% of the Italian national average.

At municipal level, 2018 closes with 98 municipalities (out of 174 managed) with a percentage of separate
waste collection of over 62% (equal to the Group average). Of these, 44 municipalities exceed 75%.
Furthermore, in 54 municipalities, the quantity of unsorted waste is less than 150 kilograms per capita. In
Emilia-Romagna the municipalities that exceed 62% of separate waste collection are 60 out of 122, fora
total of 1.4 million inhabitants (58% of the total). In Triveneto, four out of six municipalities exceed the
Group average. In Marche there are 34 out of 46 municipalities above 62% separate collection, which
corresponds to 90% of the total inhabitants of the territory.

The Group’s separate waste collection, according to Emilia-Romagna data, includes similar-to-municipal
waste sent for recovery by manufacturers and separate waste collected by volunteer associations or
directly by municipalities as defined by Emilia-Romagna Regional Authority's Decision 2218/2016,
implemented in the municipal and local regulations in force. The situation is very diverse throughout our
service area and depends on the revisions of the regulations of the individual municipalities. In 2018, this
amount of waste was around 110 thousand tonnes, excluding AcegasApsAmga and Marche Multiservizi, or
11% of the total amount of separate waste collected at Group level, down from 2017 (-16%); note,
however, that these quantities are subject to different timing and dynamics not directly related to the
services present in the area. At Group level, these quantities amounted to 8.6% of the total separate waste
collected, down compared to 2017.

The Group’s separate waste collection target for 2022 is 73% (74% for Hera Spa, 73% for Marche
Multiservizi and 68% for AcegasApsAmga), as envisaged in the latest Business Plan approved by Hera Spa’s
Board of Directors in January 2019.

When considering the effectiveness of separate waste collection, a useful indicator is the quantity per
capita figure, expressed in kg/inhabitant/year, which enables significant analyses on the quantities of waste
sent for recovery, both overall and by single supply chain. Per inhabitant separate waste collection at
Group level increased from 370 kg in 2017 to 410 kg in 2018, up 10.8% compared to the previous year.

At per capita level, separate waste collection in Emilia-Romagna, in the areas served by Hera Spa, is around
434 kg/inhabitant/year, with an increase of 12.1% compared to 2017, reaching a total quantity of more
than one million tonnes. As to the individual areas, the strong growth trend in Ferrara is continuing, with a
further 34% increase in separate waste collection per capita compared to 2017. This trend began last year
with the reorganisation of the collection system and the application of quantity-based tariff. Also
concerning the separate waste collection per capita, there have been increases in Cesena (excluding the
