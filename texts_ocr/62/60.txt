at the user’s home, to give it a new life and use it for charity. Since 2018, in the Ferrara area citizens
can dispose of reusable goods to give to non-profit organizations also at drop-off points, dropping
them off at the “Reuse area”;

e to be disposed of at the drop-off points (Separate Waste Collection Centres): if the bulky goods are
not reusable, they can be delivered to the nearest drop-off point using the vast and widespread
network of drop-off points active in the area;

e home collection service by Hera: if the item is not reusable and the user cannot take it to a drop-
off point, the user can call the call centre for the free bulky waste home collection service.

In 2018, these types of waste amounted to 3.2 % of the total waste collected and to 5.4% of separate waste
collection, in line with the previous year. In Hera Spa’s service area, 108,709 requests were made for the
collection of bulky waste, up compared to the previous year (+11.3%). Including the waste disposed of at
Separate Waste Collection Centres and the waste dumped without notification, over 48,000 tonnes were
collected. The total quantity was lower than in 2017, mainly due to the lack of the Forli area, which was no
longer served. The number of bulky waste collection requests is growing, in line with previous years, due to
the greater use of dedicated collection services and a greater number of reports for this type of waste,
largely linked to a better usability of the channels to contact Hera and a greater awareness to urban décor
matters.

In the Triveneto area, too, there was an increase in bookings for at-home collection of bulky waste, in 2018.
In Padua, the increase was +31% while in Trieste it was +27%. Note that in both areas a dedicated service is
provided for the collection of abandoned bulky waste. In Padua, the amount of bulky waste abandoned and
collected along roads increased by 13.4%. In Trieste, the quantity of abandoned waste collected fell by
5.7%.

Waste collection with particular social relevance

The “Your shoes at the centre” project started at the end of 2017 as an initiative of the CEAS — Centre for
Environmental Sustainability Education - to implement the integrated educational actions required by the
Regional Education Sustainability Programme for 2017/19. Tender 2017 no. 1.

The aim of the project, in implementation of Regional Laws 27/2009 and 16/2015, is educational and
demonstrative, aimed at involving citizens in an activity that will give new life to materials that otherwise
would become non-separate waste.

The educational activity focuses on objects close to the lives of young people, sneakers, involving families,
schools and other places of aggregation, to promote their transformation into shredded rubber material,
specially processed to make ecological flooring (playgrounds or athletics tracks) which in part will be
donated to the municipalities of central Italy affected by the earthquake of 2016.

To achieve this, the project has received a contribution from ARPAE on regional resources and is part of the
integrated action “Education for the circular economy” of the INFEAS 2017-2019 Programme.

In this edition, the project is completed with the activities of the integrated service for municipal and
similar-to-municipal waste and in this context Hera and all the other operators of the Region (excluding
ALEA which is still involved in the first phase of activation of the service) have joined.

To support the project Hera has taken on - for the municipalities of its area - the burden of organizing the
promotion activities of the initiative, collection, temporary storage and transfer of the shoes to the Benefit
ESO SPORT company, in charge of the subsequent phases of management, selection, shredding by the lead
organizer CEAS (Centre for Environmental Sustainability Education).

The operational phase took place in the period from the end of April to the end of July and involved 49
municipalities (for about 40% of the regional population), 14 CEAS organizations and all 7 managers of the
waste management service, in addition to the Emilia-Romagna Regional Government itself and ARPAE. The
communication that accompanied the initiative made it possible to give it widespread importance through
the most popular transmission channels including the main social media, the web, TV, various magazines
and publications, the projection of videos in stadiums during sports events and was a success factor that
