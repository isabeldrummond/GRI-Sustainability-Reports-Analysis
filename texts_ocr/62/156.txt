Hera for electric transportation

In September 2018 the Hera Group, through Hera Comm, and other operators in the sector, signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Emilia-Romagna Regional Government to expand the public
regional network for recharging electric vehicles. The operators have jointly committed to increasing the
number of charging stations to 1,500 by 2020.

This agreement updates the previous memorandum of understanding of 2011 in the light of the regulatory
changes that have occurred in the meantime, which have opened up the management of the charging
service to parties outside the energy world. With this in mind, the Hera Group has decided to handle all its
electric mobility activities through the Hera Comm sales company, which, starting in 2019, will also be
responsible for managing the charging infrastructure.

In 2018, demand for the recharging service continued to grow, both in terms of use of the Group’s
infrastructure and growth in the number of commercial contracts. The Group’s network of charging
stations, currently about 50 (35 of which are public and 15 private) located in the provinces of Trieste,
Gorizia, Udine, Modena and Bologna, recorded consumption of about 60,000 kWh (+12% compared to
2017). Recharging contracts, which are now 140 (+52 compared to 2017), provided a total of 11,000
recharges (+45% compared to 2017), equal to a consumption of more than 110,000 kWh and an estimated
benefit for the environment of 90 t of CO, avoided.

Hera for land protection
Land reuse in Group projects and re-use of excavated earth

In 2018, the network and plant works we completed used almost 170,000 m? of land, 68% of which was
already occupied by existing infrastructure. The Integrated Water Service, which recovered more than
95,000 m? of soil, is the most significant contribution, in relation to the number of interventions carried
out in the period under review.

From the preliminary analyses to the design of works, the Hera Group identifies technical solutions aimed
at reusing areas that have already been urbanized and/or preserving the natural context of the land subject
to intervention, in line with the objectives of the UN’s 2030 Agenda.

The following are among the main design criteria:

e in the network area: extensions carried out using existing roads and/or urban fabric, improvement
of the network layout by upgrading or reclaiming of existing pipelines, laying of new pipelines
adjacent to existing services;

e in the plant area: reuse of existing/occupied areas and infrastructures; disposal of infrastructure
and restoration/return of the area at the end of its life cycle, use of technological solutions to
reduce the overall size of the infrastructure.

During 2018 we completed many projects that involved a significant recovery of soil, among those in the
field of purification are certainly noteworthy. These include the upgrade of the Cesena purification plant
(20,000 m’), the construction of the head tank of the Riccione purification plant (14,000 m?) and the
recovery of the via dell’Ambiente plant in Ozzano dell’Emilia (BO) (5,000 m7).

In the 2019-2022 period we plan to reuse almost 700,000 m? of land in the design of infrastructure, or 3/4
of the total land involved in new projects.

Biodiversity

As regards the protection and conservation of habitats and wild species, the EU issued two regulations,
Council Directive 409/79, adopted in April 1979, on the conservation of wild birds (the “Birds Directive”)
and Council Directive 43/92, adopted in May 1992, on the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora
