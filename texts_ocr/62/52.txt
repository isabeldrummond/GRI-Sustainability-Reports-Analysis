Hera’s service area is characterized by a high level of production of similar-to-municipal waste and, as such,
it has one of the highest annual per capita waste production rates in Italy: 632 kilograms per inhabitant
(650 kilograms per capita in Emilia-Romagna, 645 in Marche and 538 in Triveneto), compared with a
national average of 489 kilograms in 2017 (Source: Ispra, 2018 Municipal Waste Report). The value
increased overall compared to 2017, in particular in Emilia-Romagna and Triveneto.

Hera Group’s service area has a very well-structured collection system that can separately collect many
different types of municipal waste, primarily for material recovery, reconciling the needs of the
Municipalities with operating efficiency and effectiveness.

Hera’s Waste Management System (WMS) is characterized by three main services:

e local collection: these are widespread collections throughout the territory, primarily targeted at
residential users and small, non-residential users and can be carried out using;

co roadside bins, set up according to the Basic Drop-Off Points (IEB) model, which groups the
main collection chains into individual stations. In recent years, electronic traceability
systems for disposal monitoring (e.g. the “lid” model for non-separate waste or locking
systems for separate waste collection chains) have become increasingly widespread in
combination with road containers;

© door-to-door collection, carried out at the users’ premises, where residents set out the
waste for collection on set days and times.

e residential collection for “target”, non-residential users that produce specific waste similar to
municipal waste (cardboard in shops, glass or cans in bars, organic waste in canteens or
restaurants, etc.);

e Waste collection centres: also known as Drop-Off Points, these infrastructures are present in
almost all the municipalities served by Hera and complete the range of services offered to residents
for dropping off separate municipal waste. The use of waste collection centres is becoming a real
habit for residents: a wide range of categories of municipal waste (including certain hazardous
waste) can be safely disposed of besides bulky and heavy waste. Moreover, in many territories,
there is a system of discounts that rewards the disposal of various categories of separate waste.

The system is also supplemented by the door-to-door collection of bulky waste (free of charge, by phone
call or by appointment), the collection of green waste, and the collection of other types of hazardous waste
(such as batteries and pharmaceuticals), at specific businesses. Lastly, roadside collection and collection at
shopping centres of WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) and of used vegetable oil is
gradually spreading.

To improve their effectiveness, the collection services are diversified according to standardized area types
(city centres, residential areas, tourist areas, suburban areas, industrial zones). For each area, the collection
system that best fits in with urban, environmental and local characteristics is identified. The aim is to
maximize the percentage of separate waste collection and its quality by providing a technically and
economically sustainable service.

Separate waste collection
The main types of separately collected waste are:

e packaging and similar: paper and cardboard, plastic, glass, aluminium and steel cans, wood;

e durable goods: iron, waste from electrical and electronic appliances (WEEE) and bulky waste;

© compostable waste: kitchen organic waste and “green” waste from mowing and pruning material;

e other waste: inert materials from small demolitions, used mineral oil and cooking oil, batteries and
accumulators, pharmaceuticals and other hazardous municipal waste.
