Comparison carried out with the data provided on the labels of 17 widely available mineral waters. The data on
drinking water refer to the averages of the analyses carried out according to the frequency and withdrawal points on
the distribution network set forth in the control and monitoring plan for the water cycle.

If even a single parameter is not compliant with regulatory limits, Hera takes immediate action to restore
compliance of the water (by washing pipes, checking disinfection, etc.), also based on the instructions of
the Local Health Authorities. For hygiene, health and public safety reasons, municipalities may issue orders
declaring that the water is not fit for drinking for specific periods of time. In these cases, it may be
prohibited to use water for cooking and drinking, or particular precautions will need to be adopted (e.g.
boiling in case of microbiological non-compliance), while in general the water can continue to be used for
all other purposes.

In 2018, 34 orders were issued, affecting a total of approximately 3,000 inhabitants:

one order concerned an area of the Grizzana Morandi (Bologna) municipality and affected 37
inhabitants for 6 days;

two orders concerned the municipalities of Talamello and San Leo, in Rimini, and affected 42
inhabitants for 5 days;

e 31 orders involved municipalities in the province of Pesaro-Urbino and affected about 3 thousand
inhabitants for an average of 2 days.

In the area served by AcegasApsAmga, no orders were issued by mayors on the unsuitability of drinking
water.

As to the presence of cement-asbestos pipes in the aqueduct network (see paragraph “Sustainable
management of the water resources” for more data) note that asbestos was used in construction and other
industrial sectors until the end of the 1980s, and was definitively banned in 1992. While it has been
recognized that the inhalation of asbestos fibres causes serious respiratory illnesses, there is no evidence of
toxicity linked to the ingestion of asbestos. In fact, current regulations on the quality of water for human
consumption (Legislative Decree 31/2001) do not set limits for the presence of asbestos fibres. In
particular, Ministerial Decree of 14 May 1996, annex 3, references a WHO (World Health Organization)
document which states that “There is therefore no consistent, convincing evidence that ingested asbestos
is hazardous to health”. The WHO reiterated this stance in the 2011 update of its Guidelines on drinking
water quality (fourth edition-World Health Organization 2011). European and Italian legislation is aligned
with the position of the WHO and does not set limits for the eventual presence of asbestos in water
destined for human consumption. In 2015, the Istituto Superiore di Sanita (Italian Higher Institute of
Health) reiterated these positions once again in one of its statements in which, among other things, it
