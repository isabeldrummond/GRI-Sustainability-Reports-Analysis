With respect to the issues in the 2017 sustainability report, there were no significant changes, but some
integrations and combinations were made. Specifically, the following issues were added: Digitalisation
innovation, data analytics, artificial intelligence; Quality and consumption of the mains water; Air and soil
protection; Integration of sustainability in the risk analysis.

It is hereby disclosed that the issue of the respect for human rights is not regarded as material because the
Group’s operational offices are located mainly in Italy or in countries in which a significant risk from this
point of view has not been noted. This evaluation also takes into account the information reported in the
Suppliers chapter where the provenance of foreign supplies is detailed. It should be pointed out that in
2018 four Group companies (Hera SpA, Hera Luce S.r.I., AcegasApsAmga Servizi Energetici S.p.A. and
AcegasAspAmga S.p.A.) were SA8000 certified, a voluntary standard that lists the requirements for ethically
correct conduct towards workers and that focuses on the respect for human rights, especially the principles
of dignified work on the basis of ILO conventions.
