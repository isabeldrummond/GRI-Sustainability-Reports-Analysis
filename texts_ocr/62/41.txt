Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions

The commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions

Since fossil fuels contribute to climate change, reducing their use is essential to limit the increase of the
main and most common greenhouse gas: carbon dioxide.

The Group’s commitment originates in the transparency and accountability of its actions and its
commitment to fight climate change and continues throughout the many projects it has initiated to
promote energy production from renewable sources, to reduce energy consumption and to provide its
customers with opportunities to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

Since 2006, in fact, the Hera Group has been a member of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), an
independent not-for-profit organization that offers businesses and countries a way to measure, track,
manage and share information about climate change and on the sustainable use of water resources, on a
global scale. Compliance with the CDP requires measuring and reporting all of an organisation’s
performance and the initiatives it takes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2018, Hera achieved level B
on an A-D scale, above the average (level C) for the oil and gas sector.

The Group’s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are mainly due to its plants (waste-to-energy and district
heating plants), and to leaks from the gas network and from landfills.

The following coefficients were used to estimate Scope 1 emissions: the DEFRA 2017 coefficients (expressed in CO2-
eq) for motor vehicle fuels (diesel, petrol, natural gas, LPG) and for emissions associated with diesel and LPG for other
uses; the coefficient of the Ministry of the Environment (expressed in CO2) for methane. It should be noted that the
emissions associated with diesel and LPG for other uses and methane gas for uses other than district heating and
waste-to-energy plants were considered starting from 2017. Greenhouse gas emissions from landfills were estimated
considering the methane contained in the biogas given off by the landfill matter, plus carbon dioxide from the
combustion of tapped biogas, from which the portion of biodegradable substances was removed; for waste-to-energy
