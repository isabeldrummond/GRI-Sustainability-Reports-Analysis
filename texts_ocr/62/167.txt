designed to determine the air quality in the areas around the incinerator, potentially affected by the plant’s
emissions. In 2013, with the new line 4 fully operational, the monitoring process was repeated in the same
way in order to assess any differences or impacts on air quality that could be attributed to the new plant
(post-construction monitoring). The monitoring results have been prepared by the Regional Agency for the
Protection of the Environment (ARPA) of Rimini in 2014 and made available in 2015. The study shows that
there is no significant impact on air quality, post-construction vs. pre-construction.

In the industrial area in which the Forli plant is located, Hera has installed a station for monitoring air
quality that is run by ARPAE Forli. This station has been operational since 2009, and provides a continuous
stream of data that are validated by ARPAE and published on their website. Periodical campaigns are also
carried out at the station to search for micropollutants and metals in the particulate matter. The results
show that there is no substantial difference between a public area and the area around the plant, indicating
the presence of a uniform environment, influenced significantly by the town rather than the
presence/contribution of the plant. These results were confirmed in 2017, when ARPAE Forli made
available the previous year’s air and soil quality monitoring data.

For over a decade, environmental monitoring tests have been carried out at the Modena plant on various
environmental compartments: air and soil quality, biomonitoring, total depositions. Since 2013, the
monitoring network has been operated by the local ARPA (now ARPAE), which carries out all the analyses
required by the waste-to-energy plant’s IEA. In addition, in Modena in accordance with the IEA, a health
monitoring study was carried out in 2003 to assess health risks for the population that lives near the
incinerator and the workers at industrial sites near it. Two reproduction indicators were analysed:
teratogenic risk, i.e. congenital malformations, and spontaneous abortion risk. The program ended in 2014
with the processing of the data collected in 2013 and showed no dose-response relationships between
exposure and relative risk of miscarriage and birth defects.

Between 2010 and 2012, a genuine environmental and health monitoring protocol was carried out at the
Ferrara waste-to-energy plant. Its details were defined by ARPA (now ARPAE), AUSL and the province of
Ferrara and it examined a number of environmental compartments. The scientific coordination for these
studies was entrusted to institutions with proven experience in the sector (CNR and Universities). The
results of the first study, which ended in October 2012, confirmed the preliminary evaluations made when
the Integrated Environmental Authorization was granted and showed that the plant’s contribution, in terms
of air quality, cannot be distinguished from the environmental background levels. In the light of the results
that have been obtained, a subset of the monitoring was extended for a second period (2013-2015), to
examine only the aspects considered most significant: air quality and studies of soil pollutants. Air quality
monitoring activities ended in early 2015, confirming the results of the two previous years. In particular, the
study of the soil, repeated in the autumn of 2013, showed no accumulation of metals and micropollutants
in the areas surrounding the plant, thereby confirming that the incinerator’s emissions cannot be
distinguished from the environment baseline. In 2015, the monitoring guidelines for coming years were
also agreed with regulators. In particular, in 2016, we signed a convention with ARPAE to continue the
three-year soil monitoring project. In 2018, environmental monitoring continued with three air quality
monitoring campaigns (spring, summer and autumn).

The Padua waste-to-energy plant, in line with the requirements of the “Memorandum of understanding on
the assessment of the health impact in the city of Padua and in its metropolitan area” signed by the
municipalities of Padua and Noventa Padovana, with Arpav, ULSS 16 of Padua, and the University of Padua
was the subject of an study that was completed in December 2015, with the presentation of the “Report on
the pilot project of population health monitoring assisted by ASL 16 of Padua, particularly on potential
health effects from air pollution - a longitudinal study in Padua (SLPD)”. The conclusions showed on one
hand insufficient statistical evidence to identify statistical effects on people’s health related to the plant’s
emissions, on the other the differential of the concentration estimates (with three decimal digits precision)
is not compatible with measurable health effects, i.e. the effect of PMio emissions from the waste-to-
energy plant on the background pollution levels. The same system is the subject of the Voluntary
agreement to monitor the effects of the San Lazzaro waste-to-energy plant near Padua, which lasts three
