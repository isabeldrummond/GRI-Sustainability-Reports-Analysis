In Emilia-Romagna, Regional Law 16 of 2015 on the Circular Economy set as a minimum objective by end
2020 the launch of Quantity-Based Tariff throughout the region. Quantity-based tariff is one of the
economic and financial instruments for implementing the Regional Waste Management Plan and makes the
payment of sanitation services no longer only linked to the area and the number of residents in a house,
but also to the quantity of non-separate waste produced. The quantity-based tariff rewards responsible
conduct.

As regards local collection, which accounts for the majority of waste, Hera is implementing various systems
geared towards the future application of quantity-based tariffs:

¢ roadside bins with a control system and user identification (“lid” system);

e residential collection with bins equipped with tag transponders;

© collection centres with weighing and user registration systems.
In many municipalities, there are mixed local collection systems (for example, roadside collection for some
materials and door-to-door for others; roadside collection in some areas, door-to-door in others): for the
sake of simplicity, the local collection services of each municipality are reclassified by their most common
system.

In view of the gradual switch to quantity-based tariff in Emilia-Romagna, reorganization of the service has
started and will continue in coming years to implement identification and measurement of disposals. In
2018 in Emilia-Romagna, for the same area, the number of municipalities with a simple container roadside
collection system fell again and there was an increase in the collection systems that identify users at the
time of disposal, to initiate or prepare for the start of quantity-based tariff. 30 municipalities use disposal
control systems (plus 1 municipality in the Triveneto area) and 17 use total door-to-door, with an increase
of 4 municipalities compared to 2017 (plus 3 municipalities in Triveneto and 6 in the Marche region). As far
as the “mixed” system is concerned, i.e. with door-to-door collection for organic and non-separate waste
and roadside collection for other separate waste, the municipalities have become 3, increasing by 2
compared to 2017 (plus 1 municipality in Triveneto and 27 in the Marche region).

In the Triveneto area, the methods used by the waste collection service, both in the province of Padua and
in the Municipality of Trieste, have not changed. The collection systems already used in 2017 in all the
territories served were substantially confirmed. The changes concern the extension of the perimeter of
door to door collection to the Mortise and S. Lazzaro districts in Padua, which however confirm a mixed
system collection in this area. As far as the Municipality of Trieste is concerned, the collection system is
mainly roadside. Also in the Marche region 3 municipalities changed from roadside collection to a mixed
system (residential collection for the non-separate waste and roadside collection for the separate waste).
