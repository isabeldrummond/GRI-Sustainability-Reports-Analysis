In 2018, the percentage of the grid that was inspected was significantly above the minimum standard
required by ARERA (100% for the high and medium pressure grid in 3 years and 100% of the low pressure
grid in 4 years). In fact, at Group level, the high and medium pressure grid inspected was over 60% and the
low pressure grid was 79%.

In 2018 the scheduled inspections of the network, network elements and gas metering units were
performed by internal staff, ensuring the highest quality of service and compliance with ARERA’s
regulations and with the Group’s guidelines.

In addition to applying the criteria and rationale contained in the Group’s operating instructions, the data
obtained from a prediction algorithm of the predisposition to pipeline failure, empirically applied and
adapted to the planned gas dispersion research activity, were also taken into consideration. In 2018, as part
of the data analysis and application of the algorithm, we decided to start another project consisting in the
development of a dynamic optimization workframe for scheduled gas leak detection work on gas networks,
which will be available from January 2019.

2018 is the second year of the second three-year period of application of the regulatory period in
accordance with ARERA Resolution 574/2013. The results achieved in 2018 must therefore be considered in
relation to future performance in 2019 and past performance in 2017 and to the standards set in
Resolution 574/2013.

In 2018, in the Group’s entire gas distribution network, 35 leaks were reported by third parties, per
thousand kilometres of network, compared to 37 in 2018. On the other hand, in 2018, 114 leaks were
identified by means of inspections on the Group’s distribution network per thousand kilometres of
network, compared to 59 in 2017. The number of third-party leakages on buried networks following
notification decreased compared to 2018, while the number of planned inspections for leaks has increased,
proving that the plan for planned inspections of leaks on high-risk and obsolescent networks is effective.

The network with high probability of leakage that was inspected was consistent with the network
inspected in 2017. In 2018, the criteria for planning and carrying out gas network inspections, as set out in
the Group’s operating instructions, were applied, with the objective of increasing the inspection
effectiveness pursuant to ARERA’s Resolution 574/2013. Furthermore, in 2018, gas network inspections
were carried out completely by internal staff thus ensuring a high quality service. In addition, in 2018,
Hera’s distribution company, Inrete, continued to plan and execute a series of inspection campaigns for
underground and above-ground connections.

Scheduled searches for gas leaks continued throughout 2018, applied also to above-ground system
components, in particular:

e the systematic check for the absence of leaks on network elements (valves, vents, crossings, etc.)
is carried out during scheduled periodic operating/maintenance activities;
