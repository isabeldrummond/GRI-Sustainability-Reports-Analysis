Transition to a circular economy

The results of Hera’s integrated waste management system

The Hera Group is a major player in the field of municipal waste management, serving 174 municipalities in
4 regions for a total population of 3.1 million inhabitants. In Emilia-Romagna, Hera Spa manages the
municipal waste service in six provinces, for a total of 119 municipalities. In 2018 Forli and 12 other
municipalities in the province of Forli-Cesena formed an in-house company and left the management
assigned to Hera Spa (in fact in 2017, 132 municipalities were served in Emilia-Romagna). Besides these
municipalities, Hera Spa manages three others in the province of Florence. In addition, through Marche
Multiservizi, it also serves 40 municipalities in the province of Pesaro-Urbino and another six municipalities
in areas adjacent to the Marche Region. Since 2013, through AcegasApsAmga, it has served 6 municipalities
in the provinces of Padua and Trieste.

The analysis of the data on collected waste must take into account the change in scope due to 13
municipalities in the province of Forli switching to in house management. For the same area, the trend in
the 2017-2018 two-year period shows an increase in the quantities collected in Emilia-Romagna (+4.6%
compared to 2017), in Triveneto (+2.4%) and a slight decrease in the Marche region (-1.3%).
