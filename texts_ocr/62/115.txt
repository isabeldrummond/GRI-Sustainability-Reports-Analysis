Utilities 4.0: HERAtech digitalization projects

For HERAtech, “Digitization” is synonymous with an innovative change that involves the entire corporate
structure, through the implementation of an “integrated” system of new functions on corporate
management (SAP) and on apps that are accessible from mobile devices. The objective is to collect a set of
different project initiatives, to rationalize and digitalize operational processes end-to-end, with particular
focus on the services offered to our customers.

Given the complexity of the project, it spanned two years (2017-2018) and covered several areas:

e Customer quotes: an integrated dashboard centrally manages all quotes requested by customers
and dispatches on a mobile device the individual technicians that carry out the work, which can
then be performed “on the field” using a specific App, without the need for operators to pass
through the company headquarters. All the data collected are immediately transferred
automatically to the central system, where all the technical and economic information is stored and
from which the estimate is then sent, also automatically, to the customer.

e¢ Execution of work for customers: likewise, a dashboard has been developed to manage all works
for customers, which also includes the management of the authorizations needed. Again in this
case, each “work order” can be assigned on a mobile device both to the technicians of HERAtech’s
Works Management office and to the subcontractors. Through specific apps, all the information to
carry out the activities of competence are made available to these parties, which once completed
can also be finalized in the app, automatically updating the central system.

e Work progress accessible to customers: an application has been prepared, available via web with
reserved access for each customer, which allows them to check the progress of technical activities
that they requested and to receive a text message at each step of the process.

¢ = Technical work back-office: a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) management system has
been developed for all back-office activities for technical work. Tools have also been implemented
to digitally manage paper-based documents which are needed for other technical customer
account activities (e.g. supply activation/deactivation).

The main environmental benefits are a reduction in the need for personnel to travel, which is due to a
reduction in the use of company vehicles and therefore a reduction in emissions, and the digitalization of a
set of activities previously managed in paper form, which now saves paper.

Utilities 4.0: The evolution of the gas meter with Hera

The innovation proposed by Hera involves a device that measures the consumption of residential gas
customers, based on a novel approach. The current devices, required by ARERA resolution 554/2015,
makes it possible to stop the supply of gas to users but cannot be used to identify potentially dangerous
conditions.

Hera’s new gas meter 2.0 is a device for measuring the consumption of gas customers which, besides the
regular monitoring of consumption, also makes it possible to check the working conditions of the gas
supply system and to intervene autonomously in the event of anomalies, both automatically and controlled
by the customer. Anomalies can be caused by earthquakes or by abnormal network conditions in the user’s
internal system or in the public distribution system.

By checking the gas pressure and flow data, the device can intervene, blocking the supply of gas using the
solenoid valve. Once corrective action has been taken it can perform a test to check that the user system
works properly, to promptly resume the service. After concluding the development phase, 2019 will be the
year in which the production of these devices and installations will begin for residential users.
