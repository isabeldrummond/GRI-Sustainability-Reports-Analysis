The percentage of separate waste collection for 2004-2016 is calculated including the quantities of waste from road sweeping, and
excluding the waste from the beaches, and only for 2013-2016 takes into account Emilia-Romagna’s Regional Government Decision
2317/2009. 2017 and 2018 data are calculated according to Regional Authority Decision. 2218/2016, including road cleaning for
recovery and the estimate of waste from domestic composting granted by the Regional Government, excluding neutral fractions
(beach, cemetery and EER flows not allowed as municipal). Separate collected waste also includes similar-to-municipal waste
disposed of by manufacturers for recovery and waste collected by volunteer associations or directly by municipalities. The differing
criteria for considering waste as similar-to- municipal laid down by ATERSIR and Municipalities may be responsible for quota
differences from one area to the next. The amount of waste consists of separate (allowed EER sent for recovery, allowed
community and domestic composting) and non-separate collection (solid municipal waste, street sweeping for disposal, bulky
waste for disposal and any waste collected separately but sent for disposal).

In 2018, separate waste amounted to 1,285.6 thousand tonnes (+5% compared to 2017). At Group level,
the percentage of separate waste, i.e. the relationship between the quantity of municipal waste collected
in separate form and total municipal waste, went from 58.2% in 2017 to 62.5% in 2018. The national
average as found by Ispra was 55.5% in 2017 (Source: Ispra, 2018 Municipal Waste Report).

In the 9 provincial capital cities served by Hera Group, in 2017, the level of separate waste collection
reached 55%, compared with a national average of 43% in Italy’s provincial capital cities and 56.3% in the
cities of Northern Italy (weighted averages, Sources: processing of Legambiente data, 2018 Urban
Ecosystem).

 

In Emilia-Romagna the percentage of separate waste collection increased by 4.5 percentage point, from
58.9% to 63.4%. The change in scope compared to last year, due to 13 municipalities in Forli switching to
the in-house company, had no impact in terms of percentage of separate collection in Emilia-Romagna: the
2017 indicator, calculated net of these municipalities, stood at 58.8% (58.9% including the municipalities of
