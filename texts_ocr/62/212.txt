During 2018, the Area Managers organised 1,750 meetings with the municipal administrations and handled
2,624 requests of many kinds. In numerical terms, the relations set up following requests and meetings
focused mainly on issues regarding the integrated water service (35.4%) and waste management services
(33.8%). Less common are issues relating to general business topics (8.9%), technical matters with clients
(7.9%) and the market area (6.1%).

Following the work carried out in 2017 which introduced cross-cutting and more homogeneous working
methods throughout the areas and which undoubtedly strengthened cooperation with operating lines to
ensure more effective local relations, development was started in 2018 with the Group Information
Systems for a new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, which will enter into operation at
the beginning of 2019. This tool will make it possible to introduce customer experience logics into the
relations with Local Authorities and to make interactions with them extremely quicker and more effective,
while also ensuring a far more streamlined management of available historical data.

With a view to increasing cooperation at Group level, in 2018, monthly meetings between Relations staff
and the Local Authorities of AcegasApsAmga were introduced and strengthened to discuss about the topics
raised throughout Emilia Romagna. These discussions also led to full involvement in the development of the
above-mentioned CRM, which will be used in 2019 by both organisational units.

Lastly, of note is the continuation of the close collaboration with the Shared Value and Sustainability
Department concerning the promotion and coordination of the HeraLABs.

The relationship with the Area Authority for water and waste services

The Water and Waste Services Regulator for Emilia-Romagna (ATERSIR) was founded by Regional Law
23/2011 and has regional competence since it has incorporated the previous provincial Water and Waste
Regulatory Authorities. It deals with the governance of the water service and the municipal waste
management services, with functions of service and investment planning, governance and control of the
management, and management of activities that are inherent to the award of the water and municipal
waste services.

As regards the water service, ATERSIR operates with second level functions as a result of the transfer to the
Italian Regularity Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment (ARERA) of regulatory and
supervisory functions which occurred at the end of 2011, with Legislative Decree 201/11.

Starting in 2018, ATERSIR operates with second level functions also for the waste service, following the
establishment of ARERA.

ATERSIR is also in charge of determining the tariff for the disposal of non-separate municipal waste
according to the tariff method provided for by regional legislation.

The relationship with the Italian regulatory and supervisory authorities

The Italian regulatory authorities that mainly affect the Group’s activities are the Regulatory Authority for
Energy, Networks and the Environment (Arera), and the Italian Antitrust Authority (Agcm).

The Arera proceedings that directly involved the Group in 2018, as part of the Authority enforcement
activities, are reported below.

With reference to the preliminary investigation that was closed due to failure to comply with the
obligations to replace the cast iron pipelines with hemp and lead joints (VIS 39/2011), after completing our
commitment to rapidly replace them entirely in the Ferrara distribution system, we are going ahead with
our commitment to inspect the entire hemp asbestos cement network that will involve the complete
replacement thereof as per the timescales set by the Regulation of the Quality of the Gas Distribution
Service (RQDG).
