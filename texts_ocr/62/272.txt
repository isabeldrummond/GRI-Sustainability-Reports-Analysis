In 2018, the ratio between near misses reported and accidents that occurred for Hera Group’s scope of
reporting was 308%. The indicator shows a constant rise. Of note in the Group’s overall result are the
results achieved by Hera Spa (204%), AcegasApsAmga (465%) and Herambiente (811%). The level of
accidents reported in Marche Multiservizi reached 74%.

The main types of near misses analysed by the prevention and protection service regarded road accidents,
falling or slipping to the ground, collisions and crushing. In 30% of cases, the analysis of the events allowed
specific corrective actions to be implemented aimed at eliminating the causes that generated the event.

During 2018, training and safety information activities (in compliance with the State-Regions agreement)
directed towards the entire workforce continued. Several hands-on training activities were carried out for
Hera personnel at the dedicated structure set up in Imola (hands-on training on access and work in
confined spaces, fire-fighting, work at height and work in the presence of moving vehicles). More
specifically, 54 training activities were organised at the training site in 2018, involving around 900 Hera
Group workers for a total of 5,239 hours.

Again during 2018, the new training procedure for Hera Spa safety supervisors, which had been planned
and tested during 2015, was further developed. The new training module which involved around 350
supervisors provided important experience-based knowledge aimed at strengthening occupational safety
culture and awareness, and enhancing safety communication and leadership skills.

A communication, awareness-raising and training initiative was launched in 2018 on road safety issues
(Guido come Vivo, involving around 1,600 individuals). This project will be further implemented over the
following years. A new road risk assessment strategy was also set up on the basis of the European project
PRAISE of the European Transport Safety Council. The Project involved the Risk management and insurance
department of Hera SpA (for sharing the purposes and events database) and of Uniflotte (for corporate
vehicle management).

The new organisational model adopted for managing emergencies in corporate sites (e.g. fire safety, first
aid) was consolidated during 2018. The project optimised the entire operational flow (Emergency Plan
preparation, emergency management simulation) and also ensured a smooth approach in all areas
managed. All the emergency drills were carried out as scheduled.

During 2018, a tender was also planned and completed to entrust the health surveillance process to a
single Group supplier.

The “Healthy lifestyles” project, which was launched for promoting healthy behaviour by Hera Group
employees, identified the area of action: promotion of healthy diets and fight against smoking. The healthy
diet project was launched in 2014 by awarding the tender for the company canteen and organising a
number of meetings with the canteen provider aimed at planning and gathering information on the dietary
lifestyles of Hera’s workforce. This was achieved through a survey on the company workforce’s eating
habits and lifestyles. Specific information activities regarding healthy diets for employees were started over
the following years. A nutritionist was available on the company premises on certain days and upon
appointment. The installation of information banner stands and monitors in the canteens continued.
Furthermore, a specific information section was included in the corporate portal and made available to all
workers. This section allows workers to view the weekly menus, ask for personalised diets (in case of
ascertained food allergies or intolerances), set up personalised nutrition counselling and receive health
advice. Following the feasibility study and design of a specific initiative for the entire workforce, regarding
the fight against smoking, implementation was postponed based on the priorities of the improvement
projects in progress.

For future years, in compliance with the indications set out in the Group’s Business Plan and with the health
and safety improvement actions both implemented and scheduled, a further reduction in the accident
indices and an increase in the near misses reported by the employees are envisaged.
