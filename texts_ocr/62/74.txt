Extraordinary maintenance and modernization of Line 2 of the Trieste WTE in the Municipality of
Trieste (TS)

The plan includes plant maintenance and modernization on Line 2, mainly to maximize energy
recovery from waste combustion by work on the components of the thermal cycle (furnace, boiler
and turbine), increasing the effectiveness of flue gas purification by changes to components of that
section and also increasing the plant’s overall reliability to ensure greater continuity of operation.

These interventions therefore involve an increase in the thermal capacity of the F3 furnace and
therefore a request to increase the quantity of waste that can be treated annually by about 19,000
tonnes per year. As a result of these measures, the installed capacity for the production of
electricity increased compared to the current 3 MW. The effectiveness of the work planned, in
relation to the protection of environmental media, was assessed by modelling the precipitation of
the gaseous emissions produced by the plant in the configuration in relation to the main
contaminants. The results obtained have been compared with the provisions of Legislative Decree
155/2010. A further comparison was made with the data on the specific air quality of the area
made available by ARPA Friuli Venezia Giulia. The results have shown that the air quality standards
are also met by adding the effects of operating the plant in the design configuration to the
background values already present in the area

Lastly, in 2018, the main requests for Environmental Authorizations concerned:

Increase in the maximum authorized quantity of waste that can be treated at the chemical-
physical plant located in Modena, in via Cavazza 45.

On 9 June 2017, the request for an EIA verification was activated in relation to the request for an
increase in the maximum authorized quantity of waste that can be treated as described below. The
incoming waste increase is 12,000 tonnes per year, mainly for landfill leachates and composting
plants, necessary in view of seasonal rainfall trends. At the logistics level, the Area 2 chemical-
physical plant in Modena plays a strategic role in terms of centrality and proximity for the
treatment of leachates generated in particular by landfills in the Modena area (Modena, Finale
Emilia, Zocca, Montefiorino, Fanano and Pievepelago), in the Ferrara area (full landfills near
Ferrara) and in the Bologna area (Sant’Agata Bolognese, Bentivoglio, Galliera and Guelfa-Bologna
landfills).

The application also envisaged a change to the limits on discharge into public sewage in relation to
certain parameters, in particular an increase in the limit for total surfactants in order to be able to
manage potential peaks of concentration attributable to the discharge of leachate from landfills
during periods characterized by low atmospheric precipitation, and a decrease, on the other hand,
of the exceptions authorized for BOD; and COD considered possible on the basis of the
characteristics of the plant’s incoming waste.

The application also included a request to modify the lime milk preparation system, which involves
supplementing the water supply of the lime milk preparer with the wastewater/inorganic waste in
storage, in order to reduce the consumption of drinking and industrial water, estimating a saving in
consumption of approximately 3.000 m?/year of industrial water.

On 30 October 2017, the procedure for verifying eligibility was completed, with exclusion from the
EIA procedure, and subsequently, on 1 June 2018, the request for a substantial amendment to the
IEA obtained on 16 November 2018 was activated.

Review of the integrated environmental authorization for the non-hazardous waste landfill, per
point 5.4 of Annex VIII to Part Il of Legislative Decree 152/2006 as amended, located in Via
Bocche 20 in the municipality of Baricella (BO).

In 2018, the VIPSA service of the Emilia-Romagna Regional Government was asked to extend by 3
years the deadline for completion of the works included in the “Project to expand the landfill for
