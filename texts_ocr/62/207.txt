Media relations

The press office manages Hera Group’s communication on the local, regional and national news media. This
work is accomplished by continuously drawing attention to the company’s many initiatives and
achievements and to the events that it organizes, both by publishing press releases and by organizing press
conferences. This effort complements, in parallel, the promotion of the Group’s activities with in-depth
interviews with management on specific issues, and by providing, at the request of journalists, information,
photographs and videos related to the services provided and to the company’s many business areas. The
press office also promptly answers letters from citizens, reacts to statements in the media of opinion
leaders, public administrators and politicians, countering any critical positions against the company or its
services, and provides a direct line, through the press, for local communities and customers. These
activities are carried out in collaboration with all the company’s structures and with all the Group’s
companies. Lastly, the office handles relations with the press offices of public and private institutions,
associations or third parties to promote joint activities.

A quarterly qualitative and quantitative analysis has been set up to gauge this daily work. It is carried out by
a specialised third party, which monitors national and local press. All the articles are weighted according to
specific criteria, such as the circulation of the publication, the size of the article, the position on the page,
the presence of photographs or lack thereof. The pieces are then grouped according to their tone: positive,
neutral, or critical.
