The initiative is part of the broader infrastructure and services digitalization process that the Hera Group
has started some time ago, with the aim, among other things, of identifying and satisfying the needs of an
increasingly “connected” and demanding public. A roadmap that is fully consistent with the European
Union’s strategy for creating a digital single market based on three pillars: improving online access to goods
and services for consumers and businesses, creating an environment conducive to the development of
digital networks and services, maximising the growth potential of the digital economy.

Diffusion of digitalization within Hera Group and its served area
Internal digitalization

Starting in 2018, the Hera Group undertook a change management process aimed at developing its internal
staff and services in the area of digitalization, data analysis and smart working. The aim of this course is to
accompany the Hera Group along the necessary change to successfully face the digital transformation and
the change in working methods. The project acts on the dimensions of culture, processes, tools and
enhancement of human capital. The range of initiatives includes: bite-sized training units, distance learning,
envisioning sessions, application sessions and participation in masters/external interventions. As part of the
change management process, the activities of the Community Data Analytics community also continued,
with 8 meetings held in 2018.

In parallel with the change management process, internal meetings are held with the Group’s top
management, coordinated by the Managing Director, in order to update the top management on the
progress of the initiatives underway in the various business units and on the projects being defined in the
area of digitalization and data analytics. These internal meetings involved about 20 people within the Hera
Group. During the year, the work team met 3 times and monitored the progress of 18 projects. The main
projects concern business intelligence systems for energy efficiency improvement and process quality, data
management for waste management services and gas networks, document optimization tools,
development of projects for process digitalization and advanced data analysis, technological
implementations to supply energy as needed to third parties.

Digitalization for our customers

The Hera Group continues to help its customers become more digital, both by developing and updating its
on-line services and by providing applications for mobile devices (Rifiutologo, Acquologo, and My Hera),
described in the “Case Studies” section of this chapter.

The Group’s On-Line Services, for which we had already overhauled graphical design and content at the
beginning of 2017, are a useful tool for customers to view their bills, check their consumption, submit
reports, report self-readings and check the progress of their procedures.

In 2018, the online services were further developed, allowing the implementation of new methods of
online payment, the activation of new contact channels (such as Live Chat, the Call Back service and the
booking of tickets for visits to our physical points, which were added to the possibility of sending written
requests) and the improvement of dedicated services for business customers.
