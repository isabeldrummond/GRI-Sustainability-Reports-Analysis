With reference to the up-dates of the 303 (Water) and 403 (Health and safety in the workplace) standards
published in 2018, the Hera Group has launched a process for the analysis of the content and the matters
requested (information and specific requests of the indicators) with the aim of bringing forward their
application with respect to the obligation fixed for 2021.

For the definition of value added and its distribution to stakeholders the “Standard GBS 2013 - Principles
for drawing up sustainability reports” defined by Gruppo di studio per il Bilancio Sociale (GBS) was also
used.

Furthermore, as a result of the commitments undertaken by the Group in relation to the Global Compact,
the report represents the yearly Communication on Progress that is submitted to this institution.

We welcome feedback on its contents

Structure of the document

The Hera Group adopts a strategic approach to corporate social responsibility and sustainability based on
the theory of Shared Value (CSV, “Creating Shared Value”), which highlights how a company can enhance
its business while generating at the same time a positive impact on society.

The sustainability report reflects this approach also in the very layout of the contents.

In addition to quantifying shared value EBITDA, introduced for the first time for the purpose of drafting the
2016 sustainability report, this report also focuses on the activities, results, case studies and investments
related to shared value creation.

The CSV approach was defined starting from the analysis of the global and local scenario, which led to
identifying 3 drivers and 9 impact areas of interest for the Hera Group. Each driver was associated with the
main Sustainable Development Goals, defined by the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations, which the Group
intends responding to.

The report is divided into 3 main sections: Sustainability, strategy and shared value; the shared value; The
bases and the organisational levers

The “Sustainability, Strategy and Shared Value” section contains the letter to the stakeholders, the
introduction (About us) and references with regard to sustainability management and shared value
(Sustainability for the Hera Group; Shared value).

The “Shared value” section contains for each defined impact area, the present and future scenario (status
indicators, policies and targets) and the Group’s responses: improvement objectives, performance
indicators and case studies.

The “Bases and the organisational levers” section contains all relevant corporate social responsibility
aspects which were not included in the shared value section (Governance and creation of value - Quality,
cost and safety of customer services - People - Suppliers). These must be considered as the basis for
generating shared value and, at the same time, as organisational levers through which value can be
increased over time.

The reporting process

In addition to the previously listed guidelines, the report was drawn up in compliance with a specific Group
internal procedure issued in 2012, already updated in 2015 and currently being further updated. This
procedure describes the activities required for planning, achieving, approving, disclosing and presenting the
report, the associated roles and responsibilities.
