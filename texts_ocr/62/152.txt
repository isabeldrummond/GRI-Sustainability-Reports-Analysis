The Imola plant, used for district heating, stands out not only for its excellent performance in terms of
energy production but also from an environmental perspective since its low atmospheric emissions were
achieved while also saving a significant amount of energy. The trend in average monthly concentrations of
some pollutants (e.g. carbon monoxide) shows a slight increase compared to previous years, due to some
combustion problems on the gas turbines. However, these concentrations remain far below the authorized
limits, which are already considerably lower than the limits set by national rules.

In 2018, following the outcome of the Energy Audit carried out on the plant, energy efficiency actions
continued, achieving an overall consumption reduction of 978 toe.

In addition, action was also taken at the Imola cogeneration plant to reduce water consumption. In fact, a
tank was built to recover waste water from the recovery boilers to be reused in the evaporative cooling
towers, thus reducing the volume of water needed for replenishment, saving 40,551 m? overall. However,
this operation caused an increase in the water used to cool the recovery boilers themselves (+27,657 m?
compared to 2017), which contain water at very high temperatures. The overall reduction in water
consumption was therefore 12,894 m? (-5% compared to 2017).

Non-circulating vehicles being disposed of were not included.

The strategy of streamlining the use of the vehicles continued, beginning with the purchase of
technologically advanced vehicles powered by fuels with reduced environmental impact to replace
obsolete vehicles.

The Group owns 4,044 vehicles, of which 496 are methane powered, 404 are powered by LPG and 22 are
electric, amounting to 22.8% of the total. In 2018, 347 vehicles were sold and/or scrapped, while 238
vehicles were registered, of which 178 diesel vehicles, 12 petrol vehicles, 26 methane vehicles, 18 LPG
vehicles and 4 electric vehicles.

Currently, excluding AcegasApsAmga and Marche Multiservizi, the Hera Group has 2,715 vehicles, of
which 419 are natural gas powered, 402 are powered by LPG and 9 are electric, amounting to 31% of the
total. In 2018, 165 vehicles were sold and/or scrapped, while 143 vehicles were registered, of which 21
used natural gas, 18 used LPG and 1 was electric, amounting to 28% of the total quantity of vehicles
purchased. Currently, excluding AcegasApsAmga and Marche Multiservizi, the Hera Group uses 2 methane
powered automatic waste compactors out of an overall total of 160.

The Group’s commitment to reducing the environmental impact of its fleet was further consolidated by the
release, in 2013, of operating guidelines that prioritize vehicles with lower environmental impact (methane,
LPG) when purchasing light commercial vehicles. Prepared in accordance with the principles set by EU
legislation, the aim of the guidelines is to reduce environmental impact by identifying more
environmentally-friendly fuels and paying close attention to the different local contexts in which the
vehicles have to be used. The benefits of the entry into force of the operating instruction are shown in the
