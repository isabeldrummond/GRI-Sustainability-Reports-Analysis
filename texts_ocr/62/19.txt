services, public lighting and district heating. The residual percentage of EBITDA for the smart use of energy
is connected to the spreading of renewable energy achieved both with commercial activities and through
the production of energy from renewable sources.

Lastly, the Hera Group generates about 13% of “shared value” EBITDA with reference to innovation,
digitalisation and its contribution to an inclusive development focused on the environment and
stakeholders. With regard to the “spreading of innovation and digitalisation”, shared value was achieved
also through telecommunication services, via the Acantho company, and through projects for the
digitalisation of operational and data analysis processes with a view to their optimisation. “Economic
development and social inclusion” was especially achieved through generated employment and the
outsourcing of environmental services to social cooperatives. This allows disadvantaged individuals to be
employed and also leads to economic benefits for the Public Administration (lower welfare costs). Lastly, in
terms of “air and soil protection”, the purchase of vehicles with a lower environmental impact and the
expansion of the volume served by district heating were privileged.
