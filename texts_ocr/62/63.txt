general to counter the problems related to hazardous electronic waste. At the same time, it aims to reduce
the digital divide of its residents by donating PCs with related peripherals to private individuals,
associations and schools in the Municipality of Cesena. In 2018, after seven years of operation, the
Trashware project was confirmed also for 2019. The project was promoted through widespread leaflet
distribution, active presence on the main social media and organization of events aimed especially at young
people. The initiatives to increase its visibility and generate interaction helped increase the number of
volunteers participating. In 2018 a trainee was brought on board to develop data removal systems for the
recovered hard disks. In 2018, the association also went through a significant organizational and
management update that limited its recovery capacity but will allow it to address its future commitments
on amore solid and structured basis. Since the project began, over 3,000 interested people have contacted
us to donate equipment. Almost 1,200 reconditioned PCs have been given to schools and associations since
the project started in 2011; with over 44 of them delivered during 2018.

 

Disposal of muni

 

pal waste in Italy and Europe and comparison with Hera

National and EU regulations define principles and priorities for waste management, from minimizing waste
at source to material recovery, energy recovery and, only as last resort, disposal in landfills.

Over the years, the Hera Group has worked in this direction, as shown by the comparison between 2002
data and data of the last three years. In particular, the results were successful in terms of reduction of
material being sent to landfills, for which a further reduction was also posted in 2018 (-2.5 percentage
points compared to 2017). This is consistent with the Group’s objectives, which, in line with national and
European regulations and the plans of the relevant authorities, envisage a reduction in the use of landfills
and an increase in separate waste collection. In 2018, the portion of municipal waste disposed of in landfills
after pre-treatment was 4.5%, compared with the 2017 Italian average of 26% (Source: Eurostat), therefore
below the 2035 goal set by the December 2017 agreement on the revisions to the directives envisaged in
the circular economy package. The use of landfills was particularly low in the Emilia-Romagna service area,
standing at 2.7% in 2018 compared to the average for Emilia-Romagna of 14% in 2017, (Source: ISPRA). It
also decreased in areas served in the Marche region in 2018 (from 34.9% in 2017 to 27.7% in 2018), thanks
to the introduction of door-to-door waste collection in 9 municipalities, which decreased the production of
non-separate waste and therefore of the municipal waste sent to landfill. At the same time, there has been
an increase in the disposal of municipal waste at third-party plants that carry out treatment and recovery.
As of 2017, Hera’s Triveneto region continues to have no landfills for the disposal of municipal solid waste.
