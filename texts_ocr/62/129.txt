In 2018, the net investments in the gas area were Euro 115.4 million, up by Euro 14.0 million compared to
the previous year. In the distribution of gas, there was an increase of Euro 12.0 million due to increased
extraordinary maintenance on networks and plants and to work on the cathodic protection of the steel
network in the Trieste municipality where work was completed on 37 km of the network, bringing the
compliance level over 95%, in line with ARERA’s requirements. The demand for new connections has
increased compared to the previous year.

Investments also increased in heat management with the activities of the companies HSE and ASE, while
the district heating service decreased as a result of the substantial work carried out the previous year on
the Barca di Bologna plant, resulting in an overall increase of Euro 1.9 million compared to 2017. New
district heating connections are up compared to the previous year.

Investments in the electricity area for 2018 amounted to Euro 23.0 million, substantially in line with the
Euro 23.6 million of the previous year. The measures carried out mainly concerned the extraordinary
maintenance of plants and distribution networks in the Modena, Imola, Trieste and Gorizia areas.
Compared to the previous year, there were fewer network extensions and more extraordinary
maintenance on plants and networks, while requests for new connections were down compared to the
previous year.

The investments for the integrated water service mainly concern extensions, enhancements and upgrades
of networks and facilities, and regulatory compliance, mostly for water and sewage treatment. Investments
were made for Euro 81.5 million in the aqueduct area, Euro 49.5 million in the sewage area and Euro 26.9
million in the purification area.

Net investments in the waste management area concerned maintenance and enhancement measures on
plants and amounted to Euro 78.1 million, up Euro 10.9 million, compared to the previous year.

Investment in the composting/digesters sector increased significantly, by Euro 9.8 million, mainly due to
measures on the Sant’Agata Bolognese composting plant for construction of its biomethane plant, besides
other measures including plant upgrades at the Tre Monti mechanical biological treatment plant.
Investments in landfills increased by Euro 0.9 million due to the combined effect of reductions due to lower
investments at the Tre Monti site and the completion in 2017 of the 9th sector of the Ravenna landfill,
offset by the 2018 work on Cordenons and on the plants of Marche Multiservizi, of greater overall value.
The waste-to-energy sector was in line with the previous year due to substantial compensation between
the lower investments in 2018 on the Pozzilli plant and the extraordinary maintenance work on the plants
in Bologna, Padua, Ferrara, Forli and Trieste. The increase in investments in the special waste plants chain is
due to maintenance work on the Ravenna plants. Investments in drop-off point and collection equipment
sector were up by Euro 1.0 million, mainly in the service area of Hera Spa while the Euro 1.8 million
decrease in the selection and recovery plants sector is primarily attributable to Aliplast Group’s lower
investments, due to the significant measures of the previous year on the PET Line for Alimpet Srl, not
entirely offset by the higher investments made in the same sector by Waste Recycling Spa.
