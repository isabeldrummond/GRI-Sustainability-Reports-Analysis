The development of our welfare plan places us among the leading national welfare and corporate well-
being companies, as witnessed by the Top Employers Italy 2019 certification, achieved by the Group for the
tenth consecutive year with an overall second place ranking (first place among Italian owned companies).
The Group confirms its place as a leading company in terms of working conditions and best practices
focused on the development and well-being of its people. Its commitment and constant focus on the
ongoing improvement of its strategies in the field of human resources is also recognised.

Diversity and inclusion

Work-life balance, commitment to guaranteeing equal opportunities and to enhancing diversity, focus on
sustainability and the generation of shared value, as confirmed by the participation in the network of
companies involved in the “Together for Work” project, stemming from cooperation between the
Metropolitan City, the Municipality and the Archdiocese of Bologna. The Hera Group implemented
horizontal cooperation, training and mentoring activities for people in need or scarcely self-sufficient and
seeking employment. Because by recognising the value of people we can ensure that customers receive
increasingly innovative services that are closer to their needs. Specifically, participation in these initiatives
actively involved us in the following areas:

e defining job placement needs;

e —co-planning job training and orientation activities;

® accompanying self-employment and social economy projects;

e providing companies with highly interesting projects (start-up, training courses...);
e implementing relationships with the schooling system;

e taking part in the co-planning of public tenders.

Hera is part of the board of inclusive companies, the network of virtuous companies that contribute to the
well-being of the community, aiming to transform employment difficulties into an opportunity for local
cohesion between companies and citizens, and enhancing people’s and citizens’ potential and the positive
impact that companies can generate throughout the local area.

Hera Group’s commitment in the area of inclusion policies and protection of diversity started way back and
was strengthened in 2009 with the signing of the Charter for equal opportunities and equality at work,
with which the company committed itself, together with other public and private parties, in the fight
against workplace discrimination. Furthermore, the introduction in 2011 of the Diversity Manager was
essential, aimed at further encouraging processes for developing inclusion and diversity enhancement
policies. A working group was also set up in 2011 composed of Group company employees of different
ages, roles, professions and training. The Group is coordinated by the Diversity Manager and works on
projects, activities and initiatives regarding diversity and inclusion.

Workshops were planned and organised across the Group’s offices with top-level spokespersons on topics
of interest such as: “From CV to happiness”, to support the professional development of women who tackle
the difficulties of the labour world on a daily basis. In 2017, the meetings focused on the topic “Beyond
gender culture, what kind of culture”, regarding gender stereotypes; the meetings had great success,
especially the satirical monologue by Alessandra Faiella “Barbie’s Version”.

Furthermore, in 2018, the “Sconfinate Energie” (Boundless Energy) event was organised to promote the
culture of disability and inclusion in the Group, with the participation of the dancer Simona Atzori, the band
Rulli Frulli and the storyteller Max Bortolotti who told the stories of some Group colleagues.
