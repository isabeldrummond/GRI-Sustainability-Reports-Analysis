Main waste treatment plant expansion measures
In 2018 we continued to develop/improve plant equipment in the following sectors:

e energy recovery in the form of biofuels (biomethane) obtained from the organic fraction of
separate waste;

production and efficient use of electricity;

greater recovery of plastic used to produce new products;

energy recovery of landfill biogas;

creation of new landfill volumes for residual waste components that cannot be used in any other
way.

In 2018 construction continued on the biomethane production plant and its was inaugurated at the end of
October 2018. In December 2018, after an initial start-up phase, the biomethane produced began to be
injected into SNAM’s network. The biomethane injected into the grid is sold for powering motor vehicles;
by doing so Herambiente obtains the incentive through CICs (Certificates of Release for Consumption of
renewable fuels). This work required a total investment of more than Euro 37 million.

In addition to these activities, the Herambiente Group made operational investments of a further Euro 42
million in the material and energy recovery sector, as well as in building further landfill volumes. The most
important among these are Alimpet’s new PET washing line, achieving full operation at the Pozzilli plant
following a change to the part of the boiler that houses the superheaters, completion of the energy
recovery works serving the 9th sector of the Ravenna landfill, final design development to replace the
boiler of one of Trieste’s waste-to-energy plant lines, activation of the authorization process for the
revamping of the F3 furnace for special waste, including hazardous waste, located at Ravenna’s
petrochemical complex.

As to the treatment and recovery of glass, the procurement of 2 glass purification and selection lines to be
installed at the plant areas of Rimini and Voltana began in 2018 and will end in 2019.

Below is a summary of some of the main environmental measures being planned, in progress or that have
been completed at the end of 2018. There are 14 projects in the Marche region, in addition to the
expansion of the 2nd and 3rd lot of the Ca Asprete landfill in Tavullia, which is currently being completed,
and the final expansion of the Ca Lucio landfill in Urbino.
