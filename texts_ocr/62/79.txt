Municipal Regulations (or according to the regulations of supra-municipal authorities - Atersir) on the basis
of the general guidelines set by the State; this waste is special in terms of origin but, after being ruled
similar-to-municipal, it is handled (collected or disposed of) together with domestic municipal waste and
subject to the corresponding tariffs or taxes (now called TARI).

Special waste is waste from agricultural, construction, artisan, industrial, sanitary, commercial and services
activities, waste coming from waste recovery and disposal activities (therefore also the waste coming from
treatment of non-separate municipal solid waste), water treatment sludge, mining or decontamination.
Waste is classified as hazardous or non-hazardous depending on the substances it contains. Hazardous
municipal waste is made up of domestic waste that contains levels of pollutants or toxic substances such
that it has to be disposed of in special plants (e.g. pharmaceuticals and batteries). Hazardous special waste
is generated by production activities and contains the aforementioned pollutants or toxic substances.

In June 2015, the European and national criteria used to classify the hazard characteristics to waste were
updated with reference to the regulation on criteria for hazardous substances (the so-called Regulation (EC)
1272/2008 on Classification, Labelling and Packaging). EU Regulation 1357/2014 applies to the assignment
of HP hazard properties (except HP14) and Decision 2014/995/EU with the new European waste list (EER,
ex CER) already applied and consolidated. EU Regulation 2017/997 entered in force on 5 July 2018 for the
attribution of the hazard property HP 14.

For all these new developments, the Group has implemented and developed specific activities to adapt and
update the classification and homologation criteria for the waste it manages.

The line between municipal waste and special waste is therefore set by the regulations defined by national
law and applied at optimal municipal and/or area level.

Until the national standard is issued, each municipality may independently define the criteria for identifying
waste from production, commercial and service activities as being similar-to-municipal waste. The more
waste that is similar-to-municipal, the less special waste is left to be handled by the private sector with the
risk of lower levels of control and traceability. In Hera Group’s service area, and in Emilia-Romagna in
general, there is a high level of production of similar-to-municipal waste: the waste handled by the public
service is estimated to include 50% waste of domestic origin and 50% waste of non-residential origin, i.e.
similar-to-municipal special waste. It is also estimated that there are around 1.5 million tonnes of similar-
to-municipal special waste that due to its characteristics (i.e. non-hazardous) is not processed as similar-to-
municipal because it is produced by a single manufacturer in quantities above the set limit. Unlike the
method used in Italy, in Europe the classification of waste is more directly related to its level of
hazardousness and to the type of treatment it undergoes.
