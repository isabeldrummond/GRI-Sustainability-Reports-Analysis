In this context, can be highlighted two aspects:

e the path of defining a single policy for all the companies in the Group that will include the principles
of social responsibility not only for workers but for all stakeholders, will continue;

e the responsibilities of the “Ethics and Sustainability Committee” have been extended for the
precise purpose of encouraging and monitoring the Group’s commitment on sustainability, on a
consistent basis with the approach which envisages its integration in the business activities and
with particular reference to the objectives of creation of shared value.

The continuity in the change is guaranteed both in the supply chain, where attention to the work
conditions will be maintained, since the activities for the control of these aspects are by now encoded in
the corporate procedures, and in the work conditions of the employees: the survey on the internal climate
will continue without any changes and the aspects dealt with by the Social Performance Team will fall
within the various dialogue and discussion channels already active (for example, encounters with the trade
union organisations and the safety round table with the H&SS Officers and the Workers’ Safety
Representatives (WSR)).

The continuity is also guaranteed with regard to the reporting inherent to the work conditions and the
aspects of sustainability which may be addressed to the “Ethics and Sustainability Committee”.

Economic value for the stakeholders

The production and allocation of value added

Value added, in this Sustainability Report, is understood as the difference between revenues and
production costs not constituting corporate stakeholder remuneration and the purchase costs for goods
and services useful for the production process. It is therefore the difference between the revenues and
costs incurred for the purchase of the production factors from other businesses and thus represents the
value that the production factors within the company, own capital and labour have added to the inputs
acquired from outside. Value added is distinct from the value added strictly applying to accounting
practices. Here, the methodology applied is that proposed in 2001 by the Gruppo di studio per il Bilancio
Sociale (GBS). With respect to the GBS methodology, rentals for use of assets owned by shareholder
municipalities and sponsorship costs are considered, as they are deemed significant for stakeholders. In
addition, in contrast to the proposal of the GBS, the portion of value allocated to financial institutions was
calculated considering the balance of financial income and charges, as deemed a better quantification of
the relationships with this type of stakeholder, as opposed to the sole figure of financial charges. With this
framework, the gross overall value added distributed is almost equal to the gross value added produced by
normal operations.

There are two important reasons for using the indicator of value added. Firstly, it enables quantification of
the wealth generated by the company, and accounts for how this wealth was generated and how it is
allocated to stakeholders; it is therefore useful for comprehending the economic impacts the company
produces. Secondly, through this report it connects the Sustainability Report with the Financial Statements.
In this sense, production and allocation of value added provides an instrument by means of which we can
reconsider the corporate Financial Statements from the vantage point of stakeholders.
