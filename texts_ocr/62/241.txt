® concurrent with routine operations on meters, (e.g. activations, closures, checks on metering
assemblies), a check using instruments is carried out to verify the absence of leaks on the above-
ground connection and meter.

The technical call centre

Receiving and diagnosing the telephone calls made to the toll-free emergency service numbers is of key
importance, since the calls can be used as actual reports of irregularity in the service provided.

The technical call centre service has toll-free numbers for each service (gas, integrated water service and
district heating), and area (Emilia-Romagna and Triveneto) in addition to a joint toll-free number for the
entire Group for public bodies (fire service, municipalities, provincial administrations, prefectures, police
stations, AUSL local health authorities, ARPA environmental protection agency, law enforcement agencies,
port authorities, etc.).

In 2018, the technical call centre in Forli received about 339 thousand calls, slightly down compared to
2017. The percentage of calls answered by the technical call centre within 120 seconds for the water
service improved from 96.9% to 98.1%.

With a view to continuous improvement of the service, an automatic customer satisfaction feedback tool
has been implemented at the end of the call of the conversations with the operator. The results showed
that 7% of the customers who contacted the call centre were satisfied on a monthly basis, with a very high
level of satisfaction for 85% of the participants in the telephone survey.

As regards the management of adverse climatic events (such as frost, floods, droughts, etc.), in addition to
the projects started in 2017, the 2018 results were positively influenced by the implementation of the
outsourcing project, which made it possible to channel excess calls at peak times, maximizing performance,
and the extraordinary management of frost events with deferred recording project, which made it
possible to direct calls to a virtual operator (except for critical user types) for subsequent management in
the back office (for the frost emergency).
