musicians, and with the Verucchio Music Festival in the Rimini area.

Cinema. Among the successful partnerships, Hera confirms its support for the promotion of film culture,
which involves and excites audiences. Among the most prestigious partnerships, we consolidated our
support for the Bologna Cineteca, that by producing the “II cinema ritrovato” (Cinema rediscovered) and
“Sotto le stelle del Cinema” (Cinema under the stars) reviews, not only offered great masterpieces, but also
gave thousands of people free access to the projections in the attractive setting of Piazza Maggiore during
the summer. We also renewed our successful partnership with Biografilm Festival, which has been hosting
the Biografilm Hera Theatre for several years, where numerous screenings were held during the famous
festival. We confirmed our interest for theatre and cinema also by supporting initiatives that take place in
other areas, such as “Rassegne itineranti”, in the 10 municipalities near Imola.

Sports and Social activities. Sports as wellbeing and a driver for solidarity are messages launched years ago
by the Bologna stage of the Race for the Cure, a “pink” race to raise awareness on the importance of breast
cancer prevention and to promote correct information on the matter. The initiative, which was a great
success, was an opportunity to highlight the Group’ s presence also thanks to the participation of a Hera
team, which joined the other 20,000 participants in a march of solidarity and awareness. In the Ferrara
