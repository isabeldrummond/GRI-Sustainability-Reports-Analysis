At European level, the trend towards reducing the use of landfills for municipal waste disposal is also
continuing, although there are significant differences among the countries: in the EU-28 the figure for 2017
was 24% (Source: Eurostat). In Italy, 26% of municipal waste disposed of in 2017 was sent to landfills
compared to 21% sent for waste-to-energy treatment, the use of landfills decreased by 2 percentage points
while use of waste-to-energy treatment increased by 1 percentage point.

Landfills continue to be the primary treatment method in 13 European countries, with peaks of up to 93%
in Malta and 80% in Greece. In Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Holland, Germany and Finland, landfill is used
for around 1% and waste-to-energy ranges from 31% to 53%, with the remainder being sent for recycling.
Hera is in line with these countries in terms of recycling with further improvements planned for the coming
years.
