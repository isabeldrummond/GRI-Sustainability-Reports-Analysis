Once again in 2018, the stock disclosed a volatility index of the listed prices (Beta index) more conservative
than the average of the shares in the sector. This characteristic is consistent with the strong resilience of
the economic results, the low risk profile and the soundness of the governance.

The daily average volumes in 2018 came to 2.1 million shares traded (-5.4% compared with 2017), while
the average equivalent value of the daily trading came to Euro 5.9 million (-2.0% compared with 2017). The
average volumes traded were better with respect to that reported by the peers who by contrast disclosed a
more pronounced decrease of -7.8%.

The greater liquidity of the daily trading with respect to the peers made it possible to draw the values of
the sales orders closer to those of the purchase orders, revealing a lower spread (0.27%) with respect to
the average of the other securities in the sector (0.28%). A more consistent comparison with the securities
not included in the FTSE MIB index (such as for example Acea and Iren) discloses an even more favourable
condition (0.27% with respect to 0.31%).
