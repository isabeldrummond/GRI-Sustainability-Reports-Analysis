started in 2013. The new model is simpler and focuses more on innovation in the services managed by
Hera. Meetings are organised over one year instead of three and more space is given to listening to
stakeholders. Made up of 12 local stakeholder representatives, the members of the new LABs appointed by
the Hera Board of Directors in November 2017 met 5 times in each single area during 2018.

Considering the 6 LABs (of the previous and new edition) as at 31 December 2018, a total of 98 meetings
were organised (equal to over 2,100 hours of listening) and 69 members planned and proposed to Hera 68
new projects, 44 of which have already been developed. Specifically, in 2018, 10 ordinary meetings were
held and a visit was made to the waste selection, district heating and waste-to-energy plants in Ferrara.

In 2018, 12 projects were co-designed thanks to the new LABs in Ferrara and Ravenna, which will be
developed during the following two years.

The 6 projects in Ravenna:

e  Partecipiamo a macchia d’olio (Spreading like an oil spill). The aim of the project is to promote
waste oil collection through an awareness-raising campaign that involves all local associations and
awards a prize to communities based on the results achieved;

¢ Piccoli robot nascono! (Small robots are born!) The purpose is to find reusable goods in the reuse
area at the Separate Waste Collection Centre of Ravenna Romea Nord, thanks to the participation
of the Angelo Pescarini “Arti e Mestieri” School and other non-profit organisations that will
supervise their recovery and their use for social purposes;

e Zero plastica in mare (Zero plastic in the sea). The project intends to develop a virtuous circle
through cooperation with fishermen’s unions and other stakeholders, in order to promote the
collection of plastic from the sea during fishing activities;

e — Escartoz. This project belongs to the food waste prevention initiatives and regards the creation of a
“green” restaurant network that promotes the practice of using doggy bags for leftovers;

« Consuma bene e raccogli meglio! (Good consumption and better collection!) The aim of the
initiative is to integrate separate waste collection with drop-off points at shopping centres for the
collection of quality plastic or other waste;

¢ Dal rubinetto, please! (From the tap, please!) The aim is to promote the consumption of mains
water by shopkeepers and public services for their customers, in order to prevent and reduce the
environmental impact resulting from bottled water consumption.

The 6 projects in Ferrara:

e Educational campaigns and foreign language communication. The project intends to use different
forms of communication that are closer to citizens, especially students and foreigners, regarding
the rules that must be observed to properly separate waste and at the same time keep the city
clean and protect its integrity. This will all be achieved through simple, clear and multilingual
communication actions and by involving local non-profit organisations;

¢ 10 in condotta (Conduct: top marks). Communication project aimed at effectively explaining the
complex nature of the water service also as regards network breakages: from the moment of
breakage to when the problem is solved;

e¢ | numeri parlano chiaro (Numbers speak clearly). Develop an information system that uses several
tools - such as a flyer attached to the bill - to allow citizens to become aware of how the waste they
separate at home is used;

¢ Compost you! The purpose of the project is to promote home composting among families and self-
composting to target users (such as social vegetable gardens). A communication campaign will be
launched to enhance biodegradable organic waste and to promote home composting, through
which citizens can collect organic waste, especially green waste, and then use the compost they
have produced in a circular economy perspective;

¢  Differenziare: il valore del tuo/nostro impegno (Separating: the value of your/our commitment).
The aim of the project is to help citizens become more aware and informed of waste-related issues
