Water consumption within the Group and water reuse

The attention that the Hera Group has always paid to issues of sustainability and circularity, has led to the
decision to concretely plan actions aimed at saving, reusing and recovering water. The roadmap, outlined in
2018, will be operationally implemented over the four years of the industrial plan (2019-2022).

The concrete and challenging objective is to reduce the consumption of drinking water by 10% in four
years (compared to 2017 consumptions in water, district heating and waste management areas) in the
most “water-hungry” business units, with initiatives that will be carried out starting from 2019. Analysis of
the conditions and the perimeter of consumption, completed in 2018, have shown that the presence of
plants — for treatment (of waste, wastewater, etc..) or district heating and cogeneration — is the greatest
factor for water consumption. The assessment of business customers has led to the same results: wherever
there is production, water is an essential element of the process and its availability, a given until now, has
not made companies aware of the need for a “circular” use of it.

To promote more efficient use of water, the Hera Group has planned structural (i.e. areas of intervention
involving investments in plant modernisation) and non-structural (i.e. aimed at creating awareness of the
use of water resources) projects for the next four years. More in detail, the main activities that will be
developed within the Group are:

e improvement of the main plants (waste-to-energy plants, purifiers, etc.) to allow the recovery and
reuse of process water, otherwise discharged into public sewage or into the body of surface water
after purification treatment;

e technological modernisation to optimise cooling systems (cogeneration plants and district heating),
thus reducing water consumption for the replenishment of circuits;

e enhancement of the search for hidden leaks downstream of the meter;

® campaigns to analyse consumption of Retail and Business customers, to stimulate and increase
virtuous and conscious behaviour in the use of water resources also among our customers.
