Recovery of waste-to-energy plant slag

The waste-to-energy plant growth and renovation plan pursued by Herambiente in recent years has had a
positive impact on the production of combustion slag. The new combustion systems and, above all, the
systems for the “cooling” and “gondola”-type systems to extract combustion slag, make it possible to have
waste with a very low quantity of unburned matter and low water content. This has resulted in a lower
percentage of slag produced and, above all, a quality level more suitable for subsequent recovery.

In 2018, the nine waste-to-energy plants operated by the Group for the disposal of municipal waste
produced 263,646 tonnes of waste, equal to 20% of the waste treated at these plants. 83% of the slag
produced was recovered while the remaining 17% was disposed of at landfills. The Ferrara and Pozzilli
plants, and since 2018 the Bologna plant, also have metal separation systems for reuse of the metal in the
metallurgical industry. In 2018, 2,506 tonnes of metals were recovered, an increase over 2017 (1,522
tonnes) despite the shutdown of the Pozzilli separation system, which was out of service for all of 2018.

Recovery of purification sludge

Purification sludge is considered special waste and must be managed as specified in Legislative Decree
152/2006. In 2018, the plants operated by the Group produced 36 kg of sludge per population equivalent
served, in line with the previous year. Recovered purification sludge was used directly in agriculture only in
the Triveneto area and accounts for 4.5% of the total. At Group level, the remaining sludge produced was
processed by dedicated incineration (24,515 tonnes, 15.4% of the total), transfer to landfills (approx.
17,676 tonnes, 11.1% of the total compared to 19.0% in 2015) and indirect agricultural reuse, following
composting (109,639 tonnes, 69.0%). The Business Plan includes several measures designed to optimize
the sludge management processes, so as to reduce the quantity and identify innovative circular economy
solutions to “transform sludge treatment and disposal into a source of opportunity”.
