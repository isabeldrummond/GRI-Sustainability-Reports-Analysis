In 2018, actions to promote the digital behaviour of the Group’s customers continued.

For example, in the 2017-2018 school year, the Digi e Lode project was launched (see the “Case Study”
section), which encourages the virtuous behaviour of Hera’s customers by using the digital services offered
(online services, electronic bills, applications for mobile devices, etc.). Specifically, the project financed
school digitalization projects for first-degree public and state-authorized primary and secondary schools in
the Bologna, Modena, Ferrara, Forli-Cesena, Ravenna and Rimini areas with Euro 100,000 for their
digitalization projects to the benefit of students. Given the success of the initiative, Hera has launched a
new edition for the 2018-2019 school year and has scheduled its extension in the Triveneto and Marche
regions (see section “What we will do” at the beginning of this chapter).

In 2018, Acantho’s customers’ subscription to the digital bill service reached 60% of total bills issued,
avoiding the printing of around 165,600 sheets of paper. In addition, Acantho decides not to produce
reports on electronic customer traffic on paper; those who so wish can consult the customer portal.
Overall, the digitalization of these two processes saved more than 1,682 kg of CO2 equivalent per year.

Electronic billing in the main Italian utilities

In 2018 Utilitalia published its first sustainability report summarizing the environmental performance of 127
Italian utility companies: Hera’s result regarding the use of electronic billing for the year 2017 (20.2%) is
more than double the average of the utilities considered (equal to 9.6%).
