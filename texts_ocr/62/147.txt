ions from waste-to-energy treatment plants compared to authorized limits —

 

The Integrated Environmental Authorisations for the plants in Ferrara, Forli, Modena and Faenza also require continuous mercury
monitoring.

The same indicator was calculated for the six plants with authorized limits that are more stringent than the
Italian regulations for 2018 (for the eight continuously-monitored parameters on average the limits set by
the authorizations are 73% of the limits set by Legislative Decree 133/2005). The data are shown in the
table above. The results are excellent also in this case: the concentrations are, on average, 81.2% below the
most restrictive limits. Note that since the limits set by the individual authorizations depend on the specific
plant, they are not comparable.
