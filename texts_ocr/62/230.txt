document is drawn up on the basis of a template prepared by the Water and Waste Regulatory Authorities
and annexed to the signed agreements.

ARERA’s resolution 655/2015 has governed the contractual quality of the water service since 1 July 2016,
defining minimum service levels that operators must respect for activities related to the requests of users,
emergency services, invoicing, access to branch offices and to the call centre and the management of
complaints. The resolution also introduced the payment of an automatic indemnity of Euro 30 to be paid if
the operator fails to comply with the specific quality standards.

It also allowed operators to access incentives for their commitment to pursue quality levels that improve
on the minimum levels required by said resolution 655/2015. Hera Spa achieved the incentive for the
Bologna and Modena areas, applying the improved levels set by Atersir for 32 standards. The most
significant standards include: the execution time for contract transfers (improved from 5 to 3 days), the
time to provide quotes for works involving inspections (improved from 20 to 12 days) and the time for
meter checks (improved from 10 to 7 days).

For the Ferrara, Ravenna, Forli-Cesena and Rimini areas, pending access to the same incentives provided for
Bologna and Modena, branch offices are already open to customers on Saturday mornings, as an added
convenience for users. The requirements of the contractual quality objectives shall also be adequately
monitored and reported to the national Regulator, to Atersir and to users by publishing them in the bills.
The service charters were published with the update of resolution 655/2015.

The waste management Service Charter is in force in the Ferrara, Padua and Trieste areas.

District heating service

In 2008, and on a voluntary basis, Hera began monitoring the quality of the “key services” and
automatically paid compensation to customers if it had not fulfilled the commitments set forth in its
“District heating service quality charter” in force in Hera’s service area. Automatic compensation ranges
from Euro 35 to Euro 140 depending on the customer’s system and is paid if standards are not met, such as
the time required to activate and terminate the supply, and reactivate it after having been disconnected
due to late payment.

the standard. The data on sales quality standards do not include Estenergy and AcegasAps Service.

Overall, the figures are in line with 2017: in 2017, 99.6% of cases, the Group provided the service requested
by the customer within the timeframes set by ARERA, the Italian Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks
and the Environment. This percentage has increased, on a like-for-like basis, from 95.8% in 2008 to 99.6% in
2018. Quality standards are close to full compliance (99.8%) for the gas services of Hera and Marche
Multiservizi (99.9%).
