Hera’s separate waste collection levels are due to the widespread coverage of its services and to the
regulations for categorization as similar-to-municipal waste, that encourage the recovery of material. In all
cases, except for metal, Hera is above the national average and for all cases, except glass and metal, it is
above the average for northern Italy.

The cost of collecting and disposing of municipal waste is also influenced by the revenue coming from the
sale of separately collected and recovered material or the contributions that Conai (the national packaging
association) provides to the service operator. In 2017, these revenues and contributions were 30% of the
direct costs of separate waste collection (including the cost of treating and recovering waste) as described
in the “Tracking Waste” report.

Separate waste collection centres

Among other types, the Collection Centres receive waste that, due to its nature or size, cannot be collected
with normal local services, and is in addition to roadside and residential collection and is the most
sustainable environmental solution with the lowest impact for collection of separate municipal waste.
There are 154 Separate Waste Collection Centres (or equipped drop-off points, including 127 in Emilia-
Romagna, 8 in Triveneto and 19 in Marche) for customers to drop-off their waste. Many Collection Centres
are equipped with weighing and user-recognition systems that make it possible to track waste disposal and
apply tariff discounts.

The waste received by the Separate Waste Collection Centres increased by 7% compared to 2017, and
amounted to 296,930 tonnes. As regards Emilia-Romagna, the comparison between the 2018 figure and
the 2017 figure on a like-for-like basis (excluding the municipalities currently served by in-house
companies) shows an upward trend of 10%, mainly linked to the supply chains of green waste and wood.
