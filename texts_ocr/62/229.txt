Bill for a residential customer with a natural gas consumption of 1,200 m? as measured by the meter and of 8,926 kWh
of electricity under a residential monomial tariff (80% of Hera’s customers falls within this tariff type and accounts for
20% of the residential volumes sold). Cities considered: Bologna, Cesena, Ferrara, Imola and Modena (weighted
average on the basis of the volume served). The bill for Ferrara was calculated excluding the tax incentives recognized
due to the prevalent use of geothermal sources. The grey areas show tariff components that are not attributable to
Hera.

The average expense for a typical household in 2018 for district heating service is on average about 5.6%
higher than in 2017, due to the increase in the wholesale cost of gas, which is a factor of the tariff. In 2016,
the Hera Group launched a new rate plan for the district heating service, aimed at families with individual
heat meters and with an annual consumption under 25,000 kWh. The new rate plan, called “Nuovo
Teleriscaldamento Hera”, offers a price for district heating that is fixed for 30 months, and a monthly fee
for the meter rental (free for the first months of activation thanks to a special promotion when the plant
was initially offered). This rate plan is designed to protect customers, with a price that does not change for
30 months, from possible increases in energy costs, while providing them with a simple and effective way
to understand their consumption. Customers who chose the rate plan at the end of 2016 or in 2017 thus
saw their expenditure “protected” both in 2017 and during 2018, a year in which energy prices rose.
Households who chose this offer from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017, in many cases, benefitted from a
lower cost than the residential monomial tariff. In the case of the average customer as identified above,
with an annual consumption of 8,926 kWh, the versions of the offer sold in the period indicated involved a
total expense for 2018 ranging from Euro 968.6 to Euro 1,033.24 per year: an estimated saving of between
Euro 179.8 and Euro 115.1 per year compared to the monomial tariff, i.e. between 15.7% and about 10.0%.
The offer also includes, free of charge, the innovative “consumption analysis” service that allows
customers, by simply reading report sent by email, to understand their consumption habits better.

Service quality
Electricity and gas

The regulation of quality divides the standards to be met into “general” and “specific”: failure to meet the
latter due to causes attributable to the Distributor requires the payment of indemnities to customers or to
the sales company requiring technical data from the distributor, which may vary depending on the type of
supply (low or medium voltage for electricity, the meter category for gas), the delay in executing the
service and the times required for compensation. Automatic compensation varies from Euro 30 to Euro 140
based on the type of supply, and can increase based on the delay in the provision of the service or the
fulfilment times.

The specific quality standards for the distribution service include, in particular, the time limits for executing
works, activating supply, and the failure to comply with the punctuality bracket for appointments
scheduled with customers (resolution 574/2013/R/Gas and 646/2015/R/Eel).

Water and waste management
When managing the integrated water service and the municipal waste management service, the operator is

committed to complying with specific minimum quality standards set forth in the Service Charter. This
