As regards Hera Group’s commercial call centre, calls are handled by the staff of specialized Italian
companies who have their operations located exclusively in Italy and in particular in the provinces of
Bologna, Padua and Venice.

The trade promotion activity is carried out by Italian-based and Italian-owned sales agencies, that rely on
operating units both in Italy (predominantly) and abroad. Their staff is employed directly by these sales
organizations, who have signed with Hera Comm a standard agency mandate.

Considering also the management of the emergency service call centre for gas, water and district heating,
which is always active in the event of failures and emergencies and manned mainly by dedicated staff from
within the company (only for some minimal operations of the integrated water service, the service is
outsourced) and located at Forli, during 2018, 99.8% of the calls was handled from Italy.

The performance of the Group’s branches improved throughout its service area, also with respect to the
improvement objectives we had set. The higher number of customers compared to 2017, throughout our
service area, did not have a negative impact on the results obtained.
