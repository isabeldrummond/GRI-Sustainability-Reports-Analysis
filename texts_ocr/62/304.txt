Enhancement of the Ca’ Nordio treatment
plant

Work on the first line of the Ca’ Nordio
treatment plant in Padua was completed,
in 2017 on the Bio semi-line and in May
2018 on the Zip line. The project defines
an innovative purification system and
meets Veneto Regional Government's
criteria for its Water Protection Plan, with
an investment of about Euro 22 million to
increase service to 230 thousand
population equivalents (from the current
197 thousand), and further improve water
and sludge treatment.

A smart system for sustainable waste
management services

2018 was the first year of full operation for
Hergo Ambiente, the new tool for
“industrial and __ intelligent” waste
management services. The system ensures
full control of the services with a detailed
georeferencing and makes it possible to
develop increasingly customized functions.
