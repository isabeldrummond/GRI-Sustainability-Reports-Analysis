non-hazardous waste located in the Municipality of Baricella (BO) and project to move the existing
medium-voltage line ENEL” approved by DGP 248 of 23/07/2013 (EIA).

This project involves extending the existing landfill for non-hazardous waste in order to increase its
storage capacity for a quantity of waste equal to approximately 600,000 tonnes.

The extension consists in building a new module for the landfill unit, substantially similar to the
current one, and as a result adapting the primary and service infrastructure of the disposal plant.
Like the existing landfill, the planned extension of the landfill is also designed to meet the needs for
the disposal of municipal waste and special non-hazardous waste.

With Regional Authority Decision 13238 of 10/08/2018, the Vipsa Service of the Emilia-Romagna
Regional Government extended by 21 months the validity of DGP 248/2013 concerning the
approval of the landfill extension project. Following this resolution, ARPAE’s permits and
concessions department announced the start of the AIA Review procedure.

Recovery plant qualification for Hera Group’s waste-to-energy plants

Directive 2008/98/EC, implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree 205/2010, introduces a criterion to
calculate energy efficiency which makes it possible to classify a municipal waste incineration plant as an
energy recovery plant. This criterion makes it possible to calculate the energy efficiency of the incineration
process on the basis of the energy introduced with the waste, the amount of energy consumed and the
amount of energy produced (thermal and electrical). In order to ensure that the methods used to apply this
criterion are consistent, a reference document has been issued at European level to calculate energy
efficiency.

The formula used to calculate energy efficiency provided by Directive 2008/98/EC is, in fact, a performance
index. Therefore, it does not match the plant performance calculated using the classical thermodynamic
criteria, but is an indicator of energy recovery capacity aimed at comparing different plants.

In addition, Decree 134 of 19 May 2016 of the Italian Ministry of the Environment and for the Protection of
Land and Sea, added a “climatic factor” to the formula to account for the climate type at the plant’s
location. This factor was added to offset climate-related effects both on electricity generation and on the
quantity of unused heat produced; in fact, the energy performance of plants located in countries with
warm climates is “physiologically” lower than those of plants located in colder areas. As well as reflecting
the quality of the investments made over the years to upgrade the plants to use the best available
techniques, the status of “recovery plant” also makes it possible to attribute to the plant a role of primary
importance in the waste management system.

In fact, while the municipal waste to be disposed of is subject to the “principle of self-sufficiency in the
water and waste regulatory area (ATO)”, the municipal waste to be recovered is subject to the “principle of
proximity”, meaning that it can be sent to the nearest recovery plant, not necessarily located in the same
ATO (Waste Regulatory Authority area) it is located in.

After having determined compliance with the energy efficiency criterion, as set by the regulation, the
authorization that governs its activities (Integrated Environmental Authorization) must be modified so that
an incineration plant can be operated as a recovery plant. These changes to the authorization are not
substantial since they do not increase the plant’s potential nor change previously-authorized emission
levels.

All the waste-to-energy plants operated by the Herambiente Group (including those of Hestambiente) are
R1 recovery plants, except for the Ravenna special waste plant (F3). In this regard, an evaluation process is
being initiated in European round-tables to define a common criterion to assign R1 operation also to special
waste plants.

The total installed capacity of the WTE plants managed by the Group (besides that of Ravenna) is
approximately 140 MWe (equivalent to a medium-small thermoelectric power plant).

The Community framework further investigated the matter, determining at European level a climate
correction factor (CCF) applicable to the R1 energy efficiency formula, in Commission Directive (EU)
