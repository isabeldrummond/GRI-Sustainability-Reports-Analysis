Recreational associations

Socialisation and interpersonal relations among Group workers are facilitated by the opportunity to take
part in recreational activities which are promoted throughout the various areas by recreational
associations. These associations organise cultural, sports, tourism and recreational activities, allowing
workers to benefit from special commercial agreements and take part in the organisation of dinner parties,
outings, Christmas and carnival events, competitive sports events, fishing competitions and ski excursions.
These associations also provide members with theatre season tickets and book-lending services.
Furthermore, the associations contribute a portion to book spending on the part of student workers and
the children of employees. Other discounts are provided for sporting activities and from several businesses.
The associations are run on the basis of budgets and yearly programmes: they are managed independently
by a Management Board whose members are elected directly by association members. Hera contributes to
the activities of the associations by guaranteeing the financial resources provided for by national collective
labour agreements and locally stipulated agreements: the company also provides space for recreational
activities or for management of these activities. The initiatives are promoted though internal
communications instruments to ensure greater visibility.

Excluding AcegasApsAmga and Marche Multiservizi, 4,601 employees were members of the associations in
2018 and the activities of the associations were financed with contributions by the company
(approximately Euro 310 thousand).
