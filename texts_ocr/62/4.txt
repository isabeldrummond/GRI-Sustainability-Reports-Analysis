Sustainability, Strategy and Shared Value

Letter to stakeholders

Our sustainability reporting: confirmations and new ideas

The sustainability report that we are presenting reinforces the innovative contents introduced in 2017
which focused on creating shared value (CSV). The positive results that we have been able to report once
again this year and the new targets set for the future are our responses to the important environmental,
social and economic challenges that the communities we serve are facing.

Consistent with the goal of further improving our accountability profile, the report includes new pages
where results are presented by single area served. A fifth report has been added to our thematic
sustainability reports which focuses on Goal 17 of the UN Agenda. It deals with the large range of activities
that involve Hera and the citizens and entities of the communities we serve.

Anew purpose: business strength to regenerate the ecosystem and the environment

The economic, social and environmental changes we are currently witnessing and that are in some ways of
epoch-making significance, are so profound that it is not enough for companies to simply contain the
negative impact of their work. Furthermore, in a context where institutions struggle to create effective
shared solutions, communities have growing expectations towards the world of business, which is
increasingly called upon to address the social and environmental challenges ahead of us.

We believe that the answer lies in our approach towards the creation of shared value. This approach calls
for reconsidering the connection between CSR and business strategy, bringing the former at the very heart
of the latter. While CSR had so far considered the “what” and “how” of business - i.e. it was “reactive” -,
shared value focuses on “why”, embracing the actual reason why the company exists - its mission and
strategy - and the qualifying aspects that make it stand out from others. We believe that the companies of
the future are those that use business strength to regenerate the ecosystem and the environment. We will
use our best endeavours to make Hera become one of them.

Reporting: from focusing on “what” and “how” to steering towards “why”

To significantly improve corporate reporting, it is essential to create a direct, binding link between CSR and
corporate strategy which must be able to make us think about the “why” of our company and allow us to
regard business as a tool for supporting it. What we need to do, therefore, is to supplement the “what” and
“how” of traditional reporting. This not only requires a deep knowledge of the company’s activities and the
impact they have on stakeholders, but also an accurate analysis of the external environment in order to
highlight the points of intersection between the company’s business and the ecosystem, which can be
regarded as opportunities for creating shared value and corporate sustainable development.

The opportunities we have identified for our company, based on the analysis of the 2030 UN Agenda and
over 60 sustainability policies at global, European, national and local level, are included in three areas: (i)
smart use of energy, (ii) efficient use of resources and (iii) innovation and contribution to development.
These three areas embrace the “why” of Hera and positively affect current and above all future
competitiveness. They also refer to three of the most significant chapters of our sustainability report.
