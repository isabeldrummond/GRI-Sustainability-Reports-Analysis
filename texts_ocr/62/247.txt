The Group’s compliance with GDPR 679/2016 was addressed through an interdisciplinary project that
involved the structure and a timely review of the Group’s entire documentation system, in order to
document compliance with the requirements of the law in protecting personal data, from the conception
and design phase of the processing, deciding the methods, safeguards and limits.

The standardization within the Group consisted in particular in monitoring and making known the
development of data privacy regulations, designing and implementing a Common Privacy Management
System for the Group, defining Group’s criteria to appoint data processors, preparing Document Templates
for the Group’s main formal fulfilments.

Specific training was designed and implemented to update on the main new regulations, and to focus on
the role of the Heads of the organizational units, responsible for processing, which involved the entire
Group.

A single Data Protection Officer (DPO) was appointed for the Hera Group, in accordance with legal
requirements.

Case study

In Good Water: why drink tap water

In 2018, for the tenth consecutive year, Hera published the “In buone acque” (In Good Water) report,
dedicated to telling users about the quality and transparency of the process that brings tap water into our
homes every day. The report is still the first and only Italian report published on the subject of tap water
and the benefits of drinking it instead of bottled water, in both environmental and economic terms.

On the basis of the new data for 2017, it has once again shown that the mains water in Hera’s service area
is a good, convenient, widespread, safe and inexpensive resource, as well as being rich in trace elements
and low in sodium, comparable in quality to the leading bottled waters on the market. Reassuring results,
guaranteed by 2,800 analyses per day (including those done by the Local Healthcare Authorities) on tap
water (carried out by Hera, by ASL - the local health authorities, and by Romagna Acque) proven by the fact
that 99.9% of the checks carried out showed the water is compliant with the water quality standards set by
law.

The report also contains, area by area, the data of the analyses of all the 29 parameters. The analyses also
concern pesticides and parameters not required by law, such as emerging pollutants and asbestos fibre:
again, the results confirmed the quality and safety of the mains water distributed by Hera.

The report, with extended contents in its online version, shows that besides being a safe choice for health
and sustainable for the environment, drinking tap water is also good for our customers’ wallets. In fact, tap
water in Hera’s service area makes it possible to avoid the production, transport and disposal of almost 250
million plastic bottles that would fill over 3 million bins and to save on average up to Euro 300 per year, for
a family of 3 people.

To ensure maximum transparency and reliability of the data reported, the report was examined and
certified by DNV GL.

The extended contents of the report are available at www.gruppohera.it\report.
