Studies on the environmental impacts of waste-to-energy plants

For many years, activities related to the incineration of waste have been the subject of many studies and
monitoring, as well as of important technical improvements also related to the introduction of increasingly
stringent plant and management criteria by European and Italian legislation. The technology has reached
very high performance in terms of reducing emissions and environmental impact.

As a result of the changes to regulations and technologies, there has been a 99% decrease in emissions
from waste incineration in Italy between 1990 and 2016, if we consider the total annual atmospheric
emissions of dioxins as the sum of all waste incineration throughout Italy for the whole tertiary sector
(Source: Sinanet-Ispra-SNAP databank).

Placing this analysis in the context of the various production segments, since 2001 waste incineration has
been the least representative source in terms of dioxins and furans emissions, contrary to the iron
industry, the steel industry and the entire residential segment (e.g. domestic heating).

The trend in terms of total annual PMio emissions shows a significant decrease of around 80% in waste
incineration emissions (between 1990 and 2016), also due to regulatory and technical changes. The PMio
emissions by Italy’s incinerators are around three magnitudes lower than those of the residential segment.
The main sources of PMio at national level are the residential segment, vehicular traffic, combustion
processes with contact (e.g. foundries) and agriculture.

Environmental supervision and air quality monitoring projects

According to the Authorizations regarding the waste-to-energy plants in Ferrara, Modena, Forli, Rimini,
Padua and Isernia, the Hera Group must carry out studies on the potential impact that its plants have on
the surrounding environment.

In 2008, in accordance with the provisions of the Integrated Environmental Authorisation of the Rimini
incinerator, the level of air quality was monitored by ARPAE (pre-construction monitoring). This study was
