In the definition of the agreement, the Hera Group availed itself of the collaboration of Vigeo Eiris, which
drew up an independent opinion with regard to the significance of the identified indicators and the level of
ambition of the future improvement of said indicators, to which the margin of the transaction is linked.

The following supported Hera in the club deal: BBVA in the role of Sustainable Coordinator, BNP Paribas
and UniCredit as Documentation Agents, and Crédit Agricole CIB as Facility Agent. All the financial
institutions involved also operated as Mandated Lead Arrangers.

The spheres of the identified indicators coincide with two CSV drivers: smart use of energy and efficient use
of resources. In particular, they concern the following areas of CSV impact: promotion of energy efficiency,
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and transition towards the circular economy. The identified
indicators are among the GRI indicators of the Sustainability Report submitted for external audit.

Hera is classified fifth among the best companies listed according to the Integrated Governance Index,
obtaining first place in the extraordinary survey into the links between business and responsible finance.
One of the reasons which have contributed to the achievement of this success is precisely the launch of the
first sustainable revolving credit facility in Italy. The Integrated Governance Index is the only model for the
analysis of the degree of integration of the ESG factors in the business strategies and has been created on
the basis of the answers which 47 among the leading 100 listed Italian companies provided to a
questionnaire comprising around forty questions. The research confirms the growth of awareness
regarding the need to integrate sustainability in the strategies of the companies and highlights an interest
which increasingly concerns roles of the company other than the CSR manager, in particular in the finance
area.
