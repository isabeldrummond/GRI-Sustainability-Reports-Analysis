In order to avoid this, after the pilot project started in 2017 on Modena and Ferrara, in 2018 the new
system for scheduling the meter-reading rounds was extended to all areas, which resumed the maximum
possible synergy of multi-service readings for each customer, in compliance with the constraints imposed
on the reading frequencies.

As regards the water service, ARERA’s resolution 218/2016/R/idr added new reading frequencies, and the
concept of a minimum time between readings. In the face of this resolution, and thanks to Hera Group’s
orientation which already went in the direction of maximizing the collection of measurement data, the new
reading plan, initiated on 1 July 2016 includes:

¢ twelve attempts per year to take a reading for all customers with annual consumption above 1,800
m? instead of the two required for customers with annual consumption between 1,800 and 3,000
and the three required for customers with annual consumption above 3,000.

e four attempts per year to take a reading for all customers with annual consumption between 500
and 1,800 m3, instead of the two required;

two attempts per year to take a reading for all customers with annual consumption between 0 and
500 m3, in line with the requirements of the resolution.

By doing so, the reading schedule has made it possible to increase the number of readings actually taken,
making it easier to identify leaks, and improve the quality of the invoicing (a smaller percentage of
consumption is estimated).

During 2018, the provisions of ARERA’s Resolution 218/2016 were also followed up with regard to the
advanced notification of a second pass to read meters for non-accessible water meters, when the first pass
failed.

For those who have not opted for a specific notification system, the reading companies have implemented
preventive notification with leaflet distribution using stickers, which also give users the opportunity to
leave a self-meter reading if they expect to be absent.

Also in the field of remote readings, intense operational and control and monitoring activities were carried
out during the year from the remote reading systems control room, which is also fundamental for
optimizing maintenance activities in the field, thus ensuring excellent availability of reading data. An
optimization introduced during the year was the systematization of the management of the electronic
meters undergoing temporary maintenance, by means of a manual reading run, always with the aim of
minimizing the use of estimated readings.

As of the end of 2018, the Hera Group achieved its targets for the year by installing almost 650,000 smart
gas meters, amounting to 34% of the total (the target for the end of 2018 was 30%), 315,313 of which were
installed in 2018. We plan to continue the installation plan for electronic gas meters, which in 2019 will
include an improved meter with advanced security features designed and developed by Hera and which will
become a standard component of the Group’s equipment. In 2018, following the consolidation of the
UNI/TR 11689 standard for remote management, the Italian Gas Committee completed its first phase of
testing, a pilot project that also involved Inrete Distribuzione. In 2018, Hera Group successfully continued to
develop an advanced version of the gas meter that incorporated specific safety functions. After the
research phases, in 2017, the product was developed in 2018 and industrialization, metrology certification
and field testing will take place in 2019. According to current plans, the first commercial installations will
occur in the last months of this year. To this end, the Group has entered into a technological partnership
with a multinational leader in high-tech technologies (Panasonic) and has identified Pietro Fiorentini S.p.A.
as a leading assembler in the national manufacturing scenario of this specific sector.

As in 2017, also for 2018, investments in smart metering gas benefited from the “Industry 4.0”

hyperamortization incentives for investments in the high-tech sector. During 2018, the operating tools used

to manage equipment for mass-market remote meter reading (meter classes G4-G6) were further

consolidated. The radio network used for remote meter reading has been extended to more towns and in

2019 it will cover almost all the major city centres served by the Group, and for the main cities, will to
