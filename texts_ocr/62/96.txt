exclusively in the plastic and green waste sectors. The initiative regarded the main materials that are
collected separately: green waste, paper, organic waste, glass, plastic, wood, iron and metals (aluminium,
steel and tinplate packaging).

The report, that for the first time includes the entire Group, shows a recovery rate of 98% for green waste,
95% for paper, 92% for organic waste, 96% for glass, 71% for plastic, 99% for wood, 98% for iron and 92%
for metal, and over 276 kg of separate waste per capita.

To produce this year’s report, 58 companies were analysed, that operate 71 first-destination waste plants.
Thanks to them we have gone up the entire recovery chain, tracing the 170 final recovery plants managed
by 162 companies that regenerated, renewed and entered into a circular economy cycle waste from
separate waste collection, reinstating it in the production cycle in a circular economy perspective. Of these,
34 plants are in the Group’s service area.

The report also includes two sections on Hera’s initiatives for the circular economy, which summarize the
main initiatives for recycling and reuse and for the circular economy and the Group’s commitments and
results in relation to the European Commission’s objectives in terms of recycling and use of landfills. Lastly,
for the first time this year, there is a section that allows users to view for each material the percentage
collected separately and recycled, but also the portion still present in the non-separate waste, highlighting
the important effort still to be made by all.

The report was presented at the international “Ecomondo 2018” event, and emphasizes how recovery is
one of the key supply chains of the green economy. The circular economy of recovery, in fact, feeds 162
recovery facilities that employ a total of 20 thousand people and achieve a total turnover of over Euro 11
billion. To ensure maximum transparency and reliability of the data provided, the report was examined and
entirely audited by DNV GL.

Separate waste collection in the old town centre of Bologna exceeds 60%.

The project for the city centre, consisting in the construction of underground mini drop-off points for glass
and organic waste, and simultaneously starting door-to-door non-separate waste collection district by
district, began at the end of 2014 in the former San Vitale neighbourhood, continued in June 2015 in the
former Porto neighbourhood, in May 2017 in the former Saragozza neighbourhood, and in March 2018 in
the former Santo Stefano neighbourhood. The businesses were also supervised to assess needs on the
target services.

The project was delayed initially by the demanding requirements set by the Archaeological
Superintendence, due to the need for continuous stratigraphic surveys and the relevant restrictions related
to underground utilities, and subsequently for the inclusion of the project (3rd portion mini drop-off points
and 3rd portion upgrade of large underground drop-off points) in a regional financing operation and
therefore, before starting all the related activities, it had to wait for the completion of the authorization
process.

Of the 140 mini drop-off points initially planned, a total of 109 were built below ground and 14 above. The
lower number compared to the plan is due to the presence of underground utilities found after starting the
work, which prevented the tanks from being installed.

During 2018, the transformation of the 15 large underground drop-off points of the historic centre was
started, from the collection of non-separate waste to the collection of plastic for the 12 dual container
drop-off points, and to the collection of paper/cardboard for the remaining 3 single points.

The entire municipality reached 52.2% in 2018 compared to 47.6% in the previous year while the entire old-
town changed from 50.0% of 2017 to 61.8% in 2018. In the three neighbourhoods of the old-town with a
collection system in place, separate waste collection is on average 63%. Checks on the quality of the
organic and glass waste continue to be encouraging, with percentages of compliant materials around 90%.
