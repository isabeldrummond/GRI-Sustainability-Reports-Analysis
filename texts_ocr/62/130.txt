Hera’s contribution to social inclusion
The tariffs for families facing financial and physical hardship

Social Bonuses are aids that reduce the expense sustained by residential customers, for the electricity and
gas they use. Residential customers with an ISEE indicator of no more than Euro 8,107.5 are entitled to the
reduction, or in the case of families with more than 3 dependent children, not more than Euro 20,000, as
defined by the Government in Ministerial Decree of 28/12/2007.

The Electricity Bonus was designed to provide savings on the annual electricity expenditure for two types
of households: those experiencing economic hardship and those where a person lives in serious health
conditions and is kept alive by household electromedical equipment. For families facing financial hardship,
the Electricity Bonus provides savings ranging from Euro 112 to 165, while for families facing physical
hardship, it provides savings of Euro 173 to 620.

The amounts of the Gas Bonuses are determined differently depending on the climate areas. They provide
savings ranging from Euro 31 to Euro 266.

As far as the water service is concerned, Resolution ARERA 897/2017 of 21 December 2017, established the
Social Water Bonus from 1/1/2018 to supply water to residential users in conditions of economic and
social hardship (ISEE indicator not exceeding Euro 8,107.50 for families with a maximum of 3 dependent
children, or not exceeding Euro 20,000 for large families). For the year 2018 alone, applications for
admission to the social water bonus could be submitted from 1 July 2018 to the municipalities of residence
or to the tax assistance centres designated by the municipalities themselves, which, after verifying
eligibility, submit the names of those entitled to receive the bonus to the Water Service Manager. When
fully operational, applications for admission to compensation for water supply must be submitted together
with the applications for the social bonus for electricity and/or gas and will be valid for 12 months with the
possibility of renewal within the month preceding the expiry of the aid. As an exception, for 2018, affected
users were paid a one-off compensatory component equal to the share of the social bonus they would have
received if they had been able to submit their application on 1 January 2018.

In the service areas of Hera SpA and AcegasApsAmga, the first disbursements will be made in early 2019.
