Energy consumption does not include: AcegasApsAmga Servizi Energetici for 2017, ASA Scpa, EnergiaBaseTrieste Srl,
Feronia Srl, Hera Comm Marche Srl, Herambiente Servizi Industriali Srl, Tri-Generazione Srl, whose consumption is
estimated at 0.5% of total energy consumption.

The organisation’s internal energy consumption, calculated according to the reporting standard used (GRI
Sustainability Reporting Standard) were estimated at 19,509 thousand GJ. They are made up of the sum of
the consumption of fuel from renewable sources (biogas and waste processed by waste-to-energy plants,
for the renewable share 51%) and non-renewable sources (natural gas, diesel fuel, LPG, petrol, and waste
processed by waste-to-energy plants, for the non-renewable share 49%), electricity consumption, the
production of renewable electricity from photovoltaic plants, and minus the electricity produced and fed
into the grid and the thermal energy produced. Primary energy consumption is calculated based on data
gathered mainly from measurements and on the basis of calculation and conversion methods defined for
the application of the regulatory provisions of Italian Law 10/91 (MISE Circular of 18 December 2014).

The Group’s energy performance can be represented by a number of indicators that express its
development and prospective targets and illustrate the company’s savings strategies. A comparison of
energy consumption with certain production and operating indicators can provide consumption intensity
indices that reflect the improvements achieved by efficiency measures and by corporate energy
management.

The data concern the energy consumption of Hera Spa, AcegasApsAmga, Fea, Hera Luce, Herambiente, Marche
Multiservizi and Uniflotte. The data refer to the consumption of electricity, natural gas, diesel fuel, LPG, petrol and
waste. Excluding Marche Multiservizi for vehicles index.

The water sector shows an overall improvement in performance in 2018, with consumption intensity
indices decreasing in both purification and making drinking water. However, it should be noted that the
