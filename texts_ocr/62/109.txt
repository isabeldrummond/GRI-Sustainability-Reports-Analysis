e ahigh aesthetic standard of the basic drop-off points for municipal waste collection.

After the first indoor prototype in made 2016, the outdoor prototype was built in 2017, consisting of a
technological totem and two waste containers. Subsequently the drop-off point was optimized and
integrated with another container to collect paper and cartons, plastic and cans and glass.

In October 2018 an experiment was started in the Municipality of Castel Bolognese in which about fifty
families were involved to give their separate waste to the island. The experimentation will about six months
to test the prototype and validate the technological choices and construction details. Wi-Fi and air quality
monitoring service have been activated at the drop-off point, while the video surveillance service of the
area is being set up in collaboration with the Municipal Police, the only subject responsible for the control
of the area.

To increase the supply of smart services, during 2018, a smart drop-off point was designed consisting of a
canopy to accommodate electric bicycles and group other services such as video surveillance, Wi-Fi, electric
charging for tri-ride, monitoring of air quality and noise levels of the area, the production of renewable
energy through a photovoltaic roofing and the parcel storage. This smart drop-off point was built and
installed in October during the inauguration of the Cesena University Campus to start the prototype testing
period.

At the end of the trials, the prototypes will be transformed into industrial products and these
infrastructures will be extended to other areas.

Smart city: Environmental sensors

The project aims to develop a network for monitoring the main parameters of air quality in the city through
the use of “low cost” equipment capable of providing indications with hourly rather than daily frequency.

In November 2017 6 units were installed in the town of Castel Bolognese, while in 2018 a continuous
monitoring and processing of environmental parameters was carried out, highlighting the key role of rain in
reducing pollutants. Chemical analyses carried out on particulate matter (PM2s) have revealed the
presence of compounds from the combustion of biomass, a quantity prevalent in the winter months.

The data collected are still being processed in order to better understand the contribution of each source
(residential, traffic) to the air pollution found. In addition, in 2018, in collaboration with the CNR-Ibimet
institute, acoustic sensors were developed to detect noise in urban areas. In the area of Castel Bolognese 6
of these units have been installed, located according to the acoustic classification of the area. The
acquisitions and their processing are still ongoing.

Smart city: Dashboards for municipalities

The dashboard for municipalities is a tool to analyse and monitor the city. It provides an integrated view of
the processing and correlation of data (Big Data) from various services and sensors installed within the
municipal areas.

The objectives that are monitored come from the SDGs of the 2030 UN Agenda and the Bologna Charter
Protocol for the Environment.

Through this tool, Municipal Administrations are equipped with a computer system that allows the
constant and real-time monitoring of environmental data. This analysis process is useful to assess the
environmental and qualitative state of the area and consequently to implement improvement and change
processes.

In 2018 the dashboard was released to the Municipality of Castel Bolognese including the following
services: environmental sensors, totems and smart waste, energy maps, environmental passport.
