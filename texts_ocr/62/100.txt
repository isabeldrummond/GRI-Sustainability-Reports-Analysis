recycled material without any cost increase and with identical technical performance. After this first phase,
the new method of pipeline construction could be extended to other construction sites and, in the future,
to other uses, thus making it possible to achieve important sustainability objectives. On the basis of the
metres of new pipes that Hera lays on average over a year, the use of recycled plastic could in fact
guarantee an estimated CO, saving, for the electricity grid alone, of 126.6 tonnes, equal to the annual
emissions of 95 medium-sized vehicles (assuming that each of them covers 10,000 km).

SCART®: the beautiful and useful side of waste

In 1998, Waste Recycling started up SCART®, an ecological and original project founded on the desire to
restore life to the materials that become waste every day. SCART® is now a registered trademark in Italy
and in Europe under which exclusive works and installations are 100% made of waste. Its goal is to
encourage responsible behaviour versus environmental matters, offering new stimuli to create useful and
artistic objects starting only and exclusively from waste as their raw material. As a result, sofas, armchairs,
tables, chairs, lamps, drawers, games, musical instruments, clothing, and installations were made, but also
scenery for shows and costumes. SCART® is an invitation to think of new styles of intelligent, creative and
most importantly sustainable life.

Many initiatives at national and international level, such as the important conventions with the Academies
of Fine Arts in Florence and Bologna, involve many students every year in seminars and workshops that are
held at Waste Recycling’s SCART® workshop. These are artistic and training initiatives addressed to
students and their topic is experimentation on the artistic use of industrial waste. Over the years SCART®
has attended many national and international exhibitions. After Ravenna, Imola, Modena, Pisa, Udine and,
after the stop in Bologna at Arte Fiera, in 2018 it’s Padua’s turn: the SCART exhibition — the “travelling
exhibit” that inserts art in an original way in the virtuous path of circular economy — has reached the
splendid setting of the Agora of the Altinate - San Gaetano cultural centre. The exhibit in Padua closes a
particularly significant year in its history: SCART was founded 20 years ago with the intention of raising the
curtain on the scenario of reuse and recovery of material, integrating and completing the mission of Waste
Recycling, which has always been committed to the treatment and disposal of industrial waste.

“More trees in the city” if you go to the Hera Green Stations

After the great success of the “Get rid of bills. Give a tree to your city” campaign, in collaboration with the
City of Modena we launched the “More trees in town” project, designed to promote urban forestry through
the increased use to drop-off points or waste collection centres.

Thanks to this initiative, throughout 2018 Hera donated a tree to the city for every 50 new households in
Modena that dispose of their separate waste at the drop-off points. The Municipality of Modena, according
to its urban green projects, has focused the planting on the large green area of the Chinnici Park.

Thanks to the collaboration and commitment of citizens, the objective of the initiative has been achieved
and by the end of 2018 more than 150 trees had been donated to the city, with the last plantings scheduled
for February and March 2019.

The project was developed to encourage greater use of Hera drop-off points: this behaviour, in fact, is
beneficial for the environment and for the appearance of city streets because it helps to reduce the
phenomenon of waste abandonment and to increase the quantity and quality of separate waste collection,
and it also translates into an economic advantage for citizens: the municipality grants users a discount on
the TARI waste tax.

“More trees in town” has made it possible to improve air quality and mitigate the negative effects of
climate change: each tree can capture 100 kg of CO2 annually. Once fully operational, the plants donated by
Hera will be able to remove 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air every year, which is equivalent to the
amount produced by a car travelling 112,000 km.
