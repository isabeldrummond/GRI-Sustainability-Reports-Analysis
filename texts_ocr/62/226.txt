Bill of a residential customer (family of 3 people in a house of 80 m2). Cities considered: Bologna, Ferrara, Cesena,
Imola, Modena, Padua, Pesaro, Ravenna, Rimini and Trieste (weighted average of inhabitants). For Ferrara, which
from 1 January 2018 introduced the Quantity-Based Tariffs, we also considered the respect of the limit of 52 disposals
per year of 30 litres each of non-separate waste. The grey areas show tariff components that are not attributable to
Hera.

A family of 3 people, living in an apartment of 80 m? paid approximately Euro 238 for waste collection and
disposal, a decrease of about 4% (about Euro 4) compared to 2017. The decrease in the total bill is mainly
due to the effect of the introduction of quantity-based tariffs in the municipality of Ferrara (approximately
Euro 48 less compared to 2017). 13% of the amount of the bill is not attributable to Hera and is for
additional provincial tax and other TARI tax items, mainly the coverage of uncollected amounts (unpaid
portion).

A Waste Tax (TARI) was introduced in January 2014 in both the municipalities where the Environmental
Hygiene Tariff (TIA) was applied and those where the Tax on Waste and Services (TARES) was applied. The
new tax was added to ensure full coverage of costs relating to the waste management service, which
includes sweeping and washing roads, rubbish collection and transportation, separate waste collection,
waste treatment and disposal, and administrative costs. The Municipalities can entrust collection of the tax
to the waste service operators. 36 municipalities have chosen to do so, for 2018. At the same time, the
number of municipalities that have changed their collection charging method from TARI to the Quantity-
Based Tariff method have now become 8, including a provincial capital: Ferrara.

According to the national tariff method for defining municipal waste management service tariffs, the tariff
must fully cover the costs of the service, including a fair return on the capital invested. In the municipalities
served by the Group, 96% of the costs of the service were covered in 2017. This percentage is the ratio
between the waste management service costs set out in the financial plans and the actual costs incurred
during the year.

The cost of waste management services for residential and non-residential customers

In 2018, Hera charged its residential customers waste management service costs that were 19% below the
Italian average and 6% lower than the Northern Italy average: these were the findings of the
Cittadinanzattiva Price and Tariff Study (Osservatorio prezzi e tariffe), which covered 106 province capitals.
The study based its findings on a standard customer consisting of a family of three living in a 100 m?
apartment.

Also, a new REF Ricerche study on the cost of the TARI waste tax in 2018 considered four types of non-
residential users in 102 provincial capitals. In Hera’s service area, hotels spend 21% less than the Italian
average, and the savings was 29% for restaurants, 36% for the food industry and 23% for supermarkets. For
non-residential users of restaurants, supermarkets and food industry in Hera’s service area, they are
cheaper respectively by 25%, 15% and 9% compared to the average for northern Italy: for hotels Hera
charges more than the average for northern Italy by 8%. The average of the four types of users considered
by the research shows therefore that Hera’s area is more competitive, with costs 27% below the Italian
average and 20% below the average of northern Italy.
