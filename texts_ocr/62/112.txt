Under the agreement, Hera and the Consorzio della Bonifica Renana have invested about Euro 120,000 to
implement the transfer system (sluice gate and pumping/extraction plant) of part of the flow rate of the
Bologna purification plant (IDAR), to the network of channels managed by the Consortium.

During the activity, additional analyses are planned on the waste water discharged by IDAR, to monitor
additional parameters with respect to those already in the authorization.

This initiative, in addition to the primary objective of protecting water bodies in the area, also pursues the
principle of reuse of water as a good to be preserved. Given the importance of these objectives and the
positive results of the project, the Group has chosen to extend the experiments to guarantee the minimum
vital flow of watercourses in correspondence with the dry seasons:

e in Sassuolo and Savignano the agreement being signed with the Burana Reclamation Consortium
and the Region will allow the reuse of approximately 500,000 cubic meters starting from the
2019/2020 irrigation season;

ein Modena an agreement is envisaged with the Municipality and the Region for the recovery of
approximately 600,000 cubic meters of water leaving the Naviglio purification plant that will be
conveyed to the Cavo Argine for irrigation of agricultural areas north of Modena;

e the POR-FERS project in which Hera participates (ENEA leader), includes among its objectives the
application of smart systems for on-line monitoring of the quality of purified water destined for re-
use and the definition of a model to decide the best destination (agronomic, industrial, other) for
the water leaving the Cesena purification plant.

Utilities 4.0: Smart Hera

Since 2015, some Hera employees have been meeting periodically to study and develop small projects to
improve and increase the efficiency of working tools, and to introduce innovations. They have already
carried out a series of activities, while others are ongoing.

Thi jatives completed in 2018 include:

* virtual receptions for managing visitor access to Hera sites through remotely-connected operators;

* the implementation of new technologies applied to company badges (such as opening company vehicles);
* the introduction of highly reliable systems that ensure operational communications in the event of
emergencies that make regular voice transmission networks unavailable.

 

Notable ongoing initiatives include:

* the addition of new functions to the corporate app to facilitate the use of a set of services for employees
(as for example the display of inter-site travel of employees to enable vehicle sharing);

¢ the installation of multimedia totems at various Group sites to allow all employees to access the Group’s
digital services and news.

Utilities 4.0: Workforce management (Hergo Reti)

Geocall is the new software platform for the management of field activities of network systems, from
operation and maintenance, to technical assistance, to emergency response. The first release in November
2018 immediately allowed a significant increase in the efficiency of the emergency activities, with a
simplification of activities, an intuitive graphical interface and the use of all the features made available by
the technology of smartphones.

Geocall has been fully integrated with our information systems based on SAP technology, and overcomes
the previous operational inefficiencies due to consultation of documents offline, persistence of paper
documents, the need for continuous phone calls with assistants, access to data only from fixed locations,
use of different devices for different functions.

The main characteristics are briefly described below:
