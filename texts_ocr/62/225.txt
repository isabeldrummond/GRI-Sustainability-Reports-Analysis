Regulation of the water service

ARERA has been the Italian regulatory agency for water services since 2012. Its initial objective was to
define a tariff method capable of supporting (efficient) coverage of costs, of increasing investments and
also promoting quality of service-oriented mechanisms.

The measures that followed, from 2012 onwards, were all focused in this direction. In particular:

e from a tariff point of view, 2018 is part of the second regulatory period, when fully operational
(2016-2019) which, in addition to confirming the criteria outlined above, initially with the 2012-
2013 transitional tariff method and then with the first regulatory period (2014-2015), introduced
the important new incentive of contractual quality, requiring minimum service levels but also forms
of recognition of levels higher than the minimum required;

e in 2018 ARERA continued the measures taken in previous years. In particular, resolutions were
passed on the regulation of water service tariff structures, which in the near future will be geared
towards implementing the per capita tariff, recognizing a water bonus for disadvantaged users, and
initiating technical quality monitoring by identifying minimum standards and the related
reward/penalty mechanisms. These resolutions, adopted during 2018, will take effect from 2019.

The matter of arrears management is still open, and the final measure is expected from ARERA in early
2019,
