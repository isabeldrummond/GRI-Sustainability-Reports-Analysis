The performance of some plants is expressed here as the ratio between electricity generated and waste
disposed of, highlighting the improvement resulting from their revamping. After revamping the waste-to-
energy plants, electricity generation performance improved by 74%.

District heating: an answer to protect air quality

District heating is a service involving the sale of heat for customer home heating and domestic hot water. It
is an alternative system to traditional autonomous or condominium-based boilers which makes it possible
to concentrate the production of heat in central installations, which are more efficient and better
controlled than home boilers. From these installations, the heat, in the form of hot water, is brought to
customer homes through a distribution network made of insulated piping. The heat then fuels the domestic
heating system via non-polluting heat exchangers.

Customers have the advantage of increased safety and lower running and maintenance costs, while
maintaining the freedom to independently adjust the temperature of their homes.

District heating provides a solution to air pollution problems in cities by replacing home boilers, which are
sometimes fuelled by gas-oil or fuel oil, with high-efficiency heat production methods that use renewable
energy, or energy recovered from other production processes.

By continuing to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy or recovered energy, significant energy-
environmental improvements have been achieved in the Group’s district heating plants.

During 2018, some new factors arose:

= the connection of the TLR Forli Centro network was completed, extended with the connection of new
institutional customers, to the TLR Forli Campus network, served by the same trigeneration plant,
which assumes the role of main heat production pole of the entire network now called Forli Centro -
Campus;

= in the last few months of 2018, Hera S.p.A. was awarded the GEO concession as a temporary joint
venture with Enel Green Power for the direct management of geothermal wells, which will be
consolidated in 2019;

= some minor systems with production from traditional boiler sources have been sold. The systems sold
are Ravenna Centre and Ravenna Lama South and Cesena Islands. The plants have been sold to their
original owners.

Calculated as the difference between a traditional system (existing boiler park comprising 65% natural gas-powered boilers and
35% diesel boilers with an average seasonal yield of 75% (Source: Comitato Termotecnico Italiano, 2009), and the national
electricity grid) and Hera’s district heating systems for the quantities of energy (thermal and electric) produced by Hera. Excluding
AcegasApsAmga. The emissions factors of the national electricity and thermal grid were updated in 2016.
