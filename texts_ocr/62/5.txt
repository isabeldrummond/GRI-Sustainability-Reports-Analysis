Confirmation of our new strategic approach: “shared value” EBITDA increases by 14%

One of the strengths of our innovative CSV reporting is the measurement of “shared value” EBITDA: the
share of EBITDA that comes from business activities meeting “global agenda” targets, ie. the “calls to
action” for the change to sustainable growth summarised in the three drivers mentioned above. In 2018,
“shared value” EBITDA amounted to Euro 375 million, rising by 14% compared to the previous year and
accounting for 36% of the total. This result is in line with the 2018-22 Business Plan, developed so that
approximately 40% of 2022 EBITDA will come from business activities responding to the priorities of the
global sustainability agenda and pertaining to the Group’s activities.

Hera supports the smart use of energy

The projects identified by Hera Spa, Inrete, AcegasApsAmga and Marche Multiservizi in the ISO 50001 area
(included in the energy improvement plan) and already implemented, made it possible to reduce energy
consumption by approximately 10,300 Toe, equal to -4.4% of 2013 consumption. The improvement plan
envisages further energy efficiency projects that will allow an overall saving of 5.3% compared to 2013,
thus exceeding the 5% target set for 2020.

Projects for residential customers include commercial offers such as Hera Led, Hera thermo and Hera
ContaWatt, in addition to the consumption analysis report, a free service allowing customers to compare
their energy consumption with a similar family. At the end of 2018, almost 15% of customers benefited
from Hera Comm’s energy efficiency services.

Lastly, of interest is the purchase of 100% renewable electricity to power the business activities of Hera
Spa, AcegasApsAmga and Marche Multiservizi, the start of biomethane production from the organic
fraction of waste in the Sant’Agata biorefinery in the province of Bologna, and 16% reduction in the carbon
footprint of energy production compared to 2015.

Hera supports the efficient use of resources

Separate waste collection continued to increase in 2018, reaching 62.5% (Italian average in 2017: 55.5%), in
conjunction with a reduction in the use of landfills for the disposal of municipal waste, settling at 4.5%
(Italian average in 2017: 26%). As regards this aspect, Hera has achieved the EU circular economy target
almost 20 years earlier, placing it among the best-performing European countries. The ninth edition of the
“Sulle tracce dei rifiuti” (“Tracking Waste”) report, published in 2018, showed a total packaging recycling
rate of 70%, already in line with the 2030 EU target.

In terms of industrial waste, of interest is the increase in the share of waste recovered by HASI, rising to
41.6% in 2018, as well as the recycled plastic products sold by Aliplast, which exceeded 84 thousand tonnes
in 2018 (+4% compared to 2017).

Our strong commitment to the sustainability of the sewage treatment system continued in 2018. Our main
projects involved Rimini (7 projects out of the 14 included in the Recovery Plan supplemented with
additional projects aimed at mitigating hydraulic risk) and the development of the Servola treatment plant
in Trieste (fully operational since June 2018), which allowed the EU infringement procedure (inherited from
previous management) to be brought to an end.

Hera supports the innovation and the sustainable development of the local area

In 2018, the Group obtained meaningful results in CSV areas linked to the economic and occupational
development of the local area, to innovation and digitalisation, and to air and soil protection.
