customer’s satisfaction while the experience is still fresh. Over 10,000 interviews/month are carried out
using IVR (by telephone with pre-recorded questions) and CAWI (by email) methods. In 2018, immediate
daily interviews became operational; since the calls are made straight after contact, the experience and
opinions of customers are more accurate. Around 140 thousand interviews were carried out in 2018 to
monitor the contact channels. The portal used for analysing customer evaluations allowed channel
performance to continuously improve.

The survey was also carried out for business customers in order to monitor customer satisfaction levels
both for the free market and protected market. In the case of companies, the contact for the services
provided by Hera is interviewed. The results of the 2017 survey are reported since those regarding 2018
were being processed on the date of approval of this report.

Other dialogue initiatives with customers

Our web portal for consumer groups has been on line since 2011: the section of the Group’s corporate
website is entirely for representatives of the main associations in the areas Hera serves, who are key
contacts for the company in its relations with final customers. For associations, this web channel is an
important interface with Hera. They can use it to handle reports and procedures, prevent disputes and
minimise the time needed to respond and solve problems. In 2018, 19,262 visitors accessed the web, for a
total of 51,698 page views: these figures show a strong growth in traffic, with a 70% increase in page views
compared to the previous year.

In addition to the portal, the contacts and operators of the associations can use dedicated email addresses,
and phone and fax numbers that, together with the web section, make up a real communication channel
reserved to consumer groups. In 2018, 855 cases were managed through this channel (797 in 2017), 77.4%
of which were solved successfully; average resolution time was 1.3 days.

Furthermore, in order to build positive relationships and create an increasingly open dialogue, Hera
organised meetings with consumer group representatives and contact persons, again in 2018. A total of
14 meetings were held on topics in which the associations showed particular interest or in relation to which
they requested clarifications and further details: specifically, updates on the Water leak fund and on
Integrated Water Service tariffs, the performance of the customer protection system (Joint Conciliation,
Energy Service Conciliation, Consumer Branch Office) and focus on the quantity-based tariff regarding the
Ferrara area only.

Internal climate survey and other dialogue initiatives

Following the 2017 climate survey, an extensive improvement plan was designed which involved the
implementation of both general actions, which affected the entire company, and specific actions created by
the various organisational areas. One of the commitments made by the various Group departments and
companies was to set up a plan for the cascade dissemination of all relevant information regarding both
group and specific topics.
