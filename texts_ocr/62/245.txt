e Emilia-Romagna Area: introduction of biometric digital signing, implementation of the POS
payment system and the expansion of the self-service booking project for the contact points within
time slots that allows customers to book in advance their visit to the branch office by choosing the
day and time among those available;

e  Triveneto Area: a communication methods innovation process has been initiated to develop a new
language that focuses on the simplicity and immediacy of the relationship, to ensure maximum
understanding and clarity in the relationship with our customers. In 2019 the booking slots will be
extended (through call centres, online services and reception) to tickets for the Trieste and Padua
branch offices so as to allow easier access for customers who request it;

¢ Marche area: total renewal of all 12 branch offices and waiting times at main branch offices are
monitored by an electronic queue management system, supervised by staff dedicated to the
commercial reception.

The results achieved by Hera Comm, which manages the majority of the branches (75 out of 116), have
improved on forecasts both in terms of average waiting time (8.2 minutes) and in terms of satisfaction
among final customers, which was stable at 88.1 points (+3.7 points compared to 2017). Considering only
Hera Comm, 3.8% of customers waited at branch offices for over 40 minutes (was 3.4% in 2017). The
number of branch offices managed by Hera Comm in 2018 increased by 3 compared to 2017 (72 in 2017) as
a result of closing the Forlimpopoli and San Pietro in Vincoli offices, on the one hand, and the addition of 5
branches of Amga Energia&Servizi on the other.

In total, considering the entire service area of Hera and its subsidiaries AcegasApsAmga, Marche
Multiservizi and Estenergy, there are 116 branches. Adding those outside the area, brings the total to 144
branches throughout the country.

Despite the complexity of the situations of the grievances, the time taken to manage the procedures
