Thanks to the significant investments made in particular by the Hera Group in the last decade, Emilia-
Romagna is one of the few Italian regions that does not risk falling into an emergency situation in the next
20 years as regards the recovery and disposal of waste.

In applying the principles and objectives defined in art. 35, the Hera Group uses the following hierarchy to
identify the priority criteria for the saturation of the capacities of its waste-to-energy plants:

e local municipal waste;

e regional municipal waste;

e any municipal waste from outside the region according to the resolutions of the relevant Bodies;
non-hazardous special waste until saturation of residual heat load.

On the basis of these principles, our Integrated Environmental Authorizations (IEAs) have updated between
the end of 2015 and during 2016 and, at the same time, we have signed framework agreements with Local
Authorities for the waste-to-energy plants of Forli, Rimini and Modena. For the waste-to-energy plant of
Ferrara, in the context of these updates, we were granted authorization to increase the amount of waste to
be treated up to 142,000 tonnes a year to cope with any emergencies outside the region for municipal solid
waste, subject to specific request from the relevant authorities. In December 2015, the local authorities in
Forli and the Regional Administration signed a specific agreement for the management of municipal waste
in the Forli waste-to-energy plant to which municipal waste is sent only from the regional catchment area
in respect of the planning being approved.

In 2018, no solid municipal waste from other regions was treated in Herambiente’s nine waste-to-energy
plants.

Special waste: similar-to-municipal waste, hazardous and non-hazardous

When one talks about waste, usually municipal waste and especially household rubbish immediately comes
to mind. However, in reality, household rubbish does not even account for 20% of all waste produced.
Indeed, in Italy, where a total over 160 million tonnes of waste is produced each year, more than 130
million is special waste, i.e. waste generated by production activities, while around 30 million tonnes are
municipal waste (household and non-household waste). In Emilia-Romagna, out of over 11.4 million tonnes
of waste produced in total, around 2.9 million are municipal waste.
