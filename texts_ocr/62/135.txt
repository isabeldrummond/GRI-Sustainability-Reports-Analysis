Hera’s contribution to the development of employment

The importance that the Hera Group attributes to employment development, as highlighted in this
paragraph, is not only reflected in the number of employees of the company itself, but also in indirect job
creation and development of social responsibility initiatives in tenders. Adding to the Group’s average
number of workers the workforce employed by its suppliers, the total employment impact is
approximately 17 thousand employees.

Employment in the Hera Group
Of the Group’s average workers, 96.2% have open-ended contracts.

The slight decrease in the percentage of average open-ended contract workers compared to 2017 is due to
the changes in the company scope during the year (as Medea and the waste management services branch
of Hera S.p.A. were sold to Alea Ambiente in Forli) and, above all, to the effects of compensating a large
number of people retiring and the need to replace them with temporary workers place on consolidation
paths aimed mainly at occupying operational positions in operations.

Open-ended contracts Other

The total average number of workers was 8,898, of which 8,562 were open-ended employees, 303 were
fixed-term employees (3.4%) and 33 were non-hired employees (0.4%), hired with other flexibility
instruments (temporary workers and staff leasing contracts). In 2018, the average number of workers with
this contract was stable compared to 2017 and decreased by 21.4% compared to 2016.

We hereby reiterate the Group’s will to reduce the use of flexible contracts, applying them only for urgent
situations (seasonality, extraordinary and temporary work peaks, substitution of workers who are absent
temporarily). However, the employees hired under flexible contracts are given priority for hiring under
open-ended contracts.
