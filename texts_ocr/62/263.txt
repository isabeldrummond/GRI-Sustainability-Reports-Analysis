The performance bonus of middle-managers, white-collar workers and blue-collar workers is defined within
the Group supplementary collective labour agreement and is based on profitability, productivity,
sustainability and sector-specific indicators.

Starting from 2018, as required by current legislation, employees have the opportunity, on a voluntary
basis, to convert their performance bonus into corporate welfare services for a maximum value of 50% of
the yearly bonus, with significant tax advantages for workers.
