objectives contained in the Group’s strategic map;

e the second contains the economic objectives defined in the budget for the year;

e the third involves an assessment on the behaviours set forth in the Group leadership model.

The structure of the balanced individual scorecard, or the weights assigned to the three areas, vary
according to the seniority of the employee and the department he/she belongs to.

The final assignment of the bonus is weighted, furthermore, according to the results reached insofar as
certain Group parameters: financial-economic business results and customer satisfaction index for
residential customers.

The assignment of the objectives to employees and the assessment of their achievement take place
through a clearly defined process which is based on the decision of top management for the individual
balanced scorecards of the directors and managers and of the directors for the individual balanced
scorecards of the middle managers. The activity takes place with the coordination of the Balanced
Scorecard System Management function of the Shared Value and Sustainability Department.

In 2018, 51% of the variable remuneration of Hera Group managers was linked to the completion of the
project-objectives planned in the balanced scorecard system: 32% was linked to the achievement of the
economic and financial budget objectives and the remaining 17% to compliance with the behaviours set
forth in the leadership model. The balanced scorecard system involves 98.5% of Group middle managers
and managers.

For managers, 70% of variable remuneration was linked to the completion of the project-objectives
planned in the balanced scorecard system and/or achievement of the economic and financial budget
objectives, while the remaining 30% to compliance with the behaviours set forth in the leadership model.
