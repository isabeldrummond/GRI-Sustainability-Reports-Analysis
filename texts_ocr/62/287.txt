therefore possible to divide up the decrease in the score over the supplier firms responsible for the
anomaly, who can be inferred from the field monitoring documentation (check list) compiled by the contact
Individual or their appointee. This allows the Company contact individual/Director of works to check the
contractual performances of the suppliers in the fundamental areas of quality, safety and the environment
with the addition of a fourth concerning corporate social responsibility. In the event of serious or very
serious non-compliance of the supplier, there is also the possibility of temporary suspension from new
invitations to private tenders for a period which ranges from three to six months. In 2018, suspension was
activated for 12 suppliers due to very serious non-compliances. In 9 of the cases, the suspension was for six
months; for the remaining cases the months of suspension were three.

The control of the suppliers takes place by means of the checks carried out by the company contact
individuals (in turn subject to internal audits on the observance of the procedures) and via inspection visits
care of the premises of the companies carried out by a certified third party so as to check the observance of
the requirements of the SA8000 standard. This monitoring by the company contact personnel takes place
for the deliveries of goods on receipt, while for the services and work it takes place during the progressive
execution of the service, for each related quarter. Specifically, the check is carried out by means of
compiling and signing specific monitoring check lists, compiled and signed also in relation to checks carried
out on sub-contractors, if present.

During 2018, another 7 check lists of services were standardised, for the purpose of ensuring an
increasingly greater coherence and equity of the assessments. Steps were taken to review the 15 check
lists already in force. Once streamlined, agreed on and standardised, the check lists were made available
on the company information portal to the contract managers, together with the specific instructions for use
and the standardisation of the various anomalies (specific non-compliances).

The policies and activities described make it possible to ensure increasingly greater coherence and equity
in the assessments made at Group level.

The number of checks on services and work is defined on the basis of the contractual amount, the duration
of the contract, and the impact on quality, safety, the environment and on the corporate social
responsibility of the services monitored.

The classification of the “quality warnings”, sent to the supplier, as a consequence of the detection, also
makes it possible to ensure the prompt and correct periodic evaluation of the qualified suppliers. The four
categories identified essentially reflect the main certifications present in the Hera Group: ISO 9001, ISO
14001, OHSAS 18001 and SA 8000.

In 2018, the joint internal audits of the Quality, Safety and Environment Department and the Procurement
and Tender Contracts Department of Hera SpA continued, for checking the procedures adopted care of
several contract contact individuals: these audits were 12 and, on the basis of the problematic elements
detected, a new training plan was developed for the company contacts. The plan illustrated and
reconfirmed - to more than 400 individuals - the innovations introduced in the accurate monitoring of the
suppliers (including sub-contractors) and within the sphere of the data loading in the company information
system.

In 2018, furthermore, inspections continued within the SA 8000 standard certification sphere in the
facilities of suppliers: in some cases partially non-compliant conduct was noted which was promptly
highlighted, with consequent launch of corrective action and prompt verification of the same. The
inspections were 8 in total, of which 1 carried out directly on site, care of the Hera worksites, rather than
care of the premises of the supplier.
