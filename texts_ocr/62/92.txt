With regard to urban areas under 2,000 pe, where critical issues remain for subjecting the final effluents to
appropriate treatment, Emilia-Romagna’s Regional Government identified and set the timeframe for
achieving compliance in its Resolution 201/2016 as: 31/12/2018 to prepare the detailed plan; 31/12/2021
to implement the measure. Compliance will be achieved by end 2021 in 91 urban areas in Emilia-Romagna
for total 55.5 thousand population equivalents. In the served Triveneto area there are 37 urban areas of
less than 2,000 pe, of which 34 are already compliant with the regulations in 2018, one is planned to be
finished in 2019 and two will be upgraded in subsequent years. Considering Emilia-Romagna and Triveneto,
there are 254 urban areas with less than 2,000 pe for a total of 200 thousand population equivalents, of
which 62.2% are compliant (160 urban areas for 103 thousand population equivalents, equal to 64.2% of
the population equivalents). By 2021, 252 urban areas out of 254 (99.2%) will have been adapted to less
than 2,000 pe. With regard to urban areas of less than 2,000 pe in Marche, the Regional Government is still
at a standstill having done their initial identification, without having yet issued provisions in this regard.

Constructed wetlands

Constructed wetlands are a natural process used to treat polluted water based on the capability of soil and
vegetation to remove pollutants. They are designed as a system of biological ponds and of planted
macrophyte vegetation. The purification process is completely environmentally friendly and does not
involve the use of chemicals. The wastewater arriving at the constructed wetlands plant flows into a bed of
gravel and aquatic plants: here many different species of microorganisms come into play and through
biochemical reactions, eliminate the pollutants present. The action of the plants is fundamental because
the micro-organisms necessary for the entire system develop in their roots; they absorb the oxygen
produced by the plant species and trigger the processes necessary for purification of the wastewater.

This kind of treatment also contributes to the reclamation of borderline areas, creating natural
environments and landscapes that are pleasing to the eye, and often chosen as refuges for various species
of birds, amphibians and reptiles.

Hera operates 17 small or medium-capacity constructed wetlands, located in the provinces of Bologna,
Florence, Forli-Cesena, Rimini and Ravenna: some are secondary biological treatment plants downstream of
primary sedimentation while others are tertiary treatments used for final refinement of the wastewater
before its final discharge. Marche Multiservizi operates 5 constructed wetlands plants with a potential of
between 80 and 180 population equivalents.
