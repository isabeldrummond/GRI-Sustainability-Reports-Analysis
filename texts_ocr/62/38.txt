Thermal energy produced from renewable sources increased by 3% in 2018 following an increase in the
energy from geothermal sources (over 11,800 MWh compared to 2017, +16%). The share of energy
produced has decreased: from cogeneration (-4%) — due to the lower number of hours of operation of the
Imola Casalegno plant as mentioned above — and from the waste-to-energy plants (-11%).

Total net thermal energy produced by the Group’s plants increased by 8%, mainly due to the increase in
production from thermal power stations (+64 thousand MWh).

Thermal energy produced from renewable sources was 20.3% of the total in 2018, slightly down compared
with 2017, due to the lower production of total energy by the waste-to-energy plants, with consequences
on the renewable share of this source. This reduction is only partly offset by the already-mentioned
increase in the production of geothermal energy. 34% generated using cogeneration, a high energy
efficiency system. Together, the two categories account for 54% of the electricity produced. The energy
recovered from waste-to-energy transformation for the share exceeding 51% is 9.1%.
