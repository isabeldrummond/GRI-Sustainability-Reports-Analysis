fresh fruit and vegetables. There is now a virtuous alternative for these products, which otherwise would
be thrown away, thanks to the collaboration between the Municipality of Modena, the Hera Group and the
market itself. Traders, in fact, can choose to donate their leftovers to Porta Aperta, so they can be used for
the benefit of people in distress. In 2018, more than 2,000 kg of food was collected and reused by 21
operators who collaborated in the project. The Italian Bike Messenger (IBM) association is among the
partners involved in the project, the headquarters of which is within the Mercato Albinelli and provides
support for the delivery of surpluses.

FarmacoAmico: 46 thousand packets of pharmaceuticals not yet expired recovered

FarmacoAmico is the project promoted by Hera to collect medicines that have not yet expired and to create
a charitable network in the local area. The pharmaceuticals, which must still have at least six months to go
before their use-by dates and which have been properly stored, are thus reused by non-profit organizations
that operate in local or decentralized cooperation projects. The goal is to prevent the production of waste,
spreading good practices on the decrease of waste and supporting the organizations that help the weaker
sections of society.

Launched in 2013, in Bologna, FarmacoAmico is jointly organized with Last Minute Market and currently
involves 17 municipalities in Emilia-Romagna where there are about 1.2 million inhabitants (48% of the
population served). The result is positive because, despite the Forli and Forlimpopoli areas being no longer
included, since they have switched to in-house management, the extensions in other municipalities have
made it possible to almost achieve the goal we had set for ourselves (50% by 2019). It should be noted that
the Non-profit organization of reference in the two areas mentioned, Comitato per la lotta della fame nel
mondo, has not been excluded from the Last Minute Market network, but has been accredited as a
beneficiary of second-level pharmaceuticals.

In 2018, in the areas mentioned above, about 46,000 packets of pharmaceuticals were sent for reuse (-
14% on 2016 values, but +15% on a like-for-like basis) for a total value of over Euro 549 thousand (-18% on
2016 values, but +10% on a like-for-like basis). Despite the fact that impossibility of continuing the project
in the areas of Forli and Forlimpopoli has certainly negatively affected the total numbers of the initiative,
the new activations during 2018 (ceramic district of Modena, Castel San Pietro Terme, Castenaso) and the
upcoming activations in 2019, certainly confirm the growth of the project as a whole.

The project involved a total of 102 pharmacies and 27 not-for-profit organizations, some of which operate
abroad, as well as several partners, institutions, trade and business associations, for a total of 31 parties
involved.

Since the beginning of the project, more than 221,000 packets of pharmaceuticals with a total economic
value of Euro 2.4 million have been collected and sent for reuse, corresponding to an equivalent saving for
the National Health System.

In July 2018 Hera and Last Minute Market signed, with the Department of Health of the Emilia-Romagna
Regional Government, a Protocol of Intent on the recovery of donated pharmaceuticals. In addition, we
are adapting the Farmaco Amico project to the guidelines for recovery of pharmaceuticals proposed by the
Emilia-Romagna Regional Government. This adjustment required, in some areas, short suspensions of the
project’s operation, to allow the installation of the management software and training of pharmacists on its
use. This activity, which has particularly affected the Modena and Ceramic District areas, has led in the very
short term to a drop in results, and has made it possible to consolidate the foundations on which the entire
Farmaco Amico project is based.

In the Bologna area, thanks to the initiative of Fondazione ANT, as part of the joint school-work experience
courses, students from several high schools in the Bologna area attended lessons that introduced the
FarmacoAmico project, and a 40-hour internship was then developed, in which the students worked to
raise awareness among residents in a number of pharmacies that participated in the project.
