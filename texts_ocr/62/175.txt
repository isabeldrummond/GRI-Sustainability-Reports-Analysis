* the Vice Chairman monitors the coordination between the Risk Committee and the Control and Risks
Committee;

* the Control and Risks Committee supports the Board of Directors in defining the guidelines of the
internal control and risk management system;

* the Risk Committee is the main body that steers, monitors and reports the risk management strategies
adopted. It defines the general guidelines for the Risk Management process, guarantees the mapping
and monitoring of corporate risks, assures the definition of the Risk Policies and defines the protocols

In Hera, there is an appropriate separation between the role of risk control and management (entrusted to
the risk owners in the various organisational units) and of evaluation of the appropriateness of the risk
management processes. Specifically, the proper and effective operation of the internal control and risk
management system is monitored at centralised level by the Internal Auditing Department, which reports
directly to the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors.

The two main corporate bodies in charge of supervising risks are described in greater detail below,
according to their respective responsibilities.

Control and Risks Committee

The Control and Risks Committee’s duty, in application of Principle 7 of the Code of Conduct, is to monitor
the functioning of the internal control system, the efficiency of corporate operations, the reliability of
financial information, as well as compliance with the law and regulations and the protection of corporate
assets. This Committee also has the task of supporting, with adequate investigations, the Board of Directors
in its evaluations and decisions regarding the risk management system. The Chairman of the Board of
statutory auditors or an auditor appointed by Chairman attends the committee’s meetings as well as the
Managing Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors, at the explicit request of the Chairman of
the committee.

The Control and Risks Committee met 7 times in 2018.

The Risk Committee

The Risk Committee was appointed in April 2014 and is composed of the Executive Chairman, Vice
