Considering the 9,443 analyses carried out in 2018 on 230 purification plants, in 99.7% of the cases the
results were compliant with the regulatory limits. The final values for this indicator in 2018 show a very
satisfactory situation with excellent percentages of the total checks found compliant. Also in this case
Triveneto benefits from the effects of the adaptation of the purification plant of Servola, in Trieste. The
only cases that exceeded the authorized limits were in relation to purely incidental situations, largely
compatible with the variability of the incoming quantities, the operating conditions and the structural

condition of the plants.
