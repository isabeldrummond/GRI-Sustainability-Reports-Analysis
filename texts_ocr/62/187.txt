The portion of value added intended for the workforce. Personnel costs fell by Euro 0.2 million, down
slightly with respect to last year. The remuneration increases envisaged by the national collective
agreement were offset by minor resources following the changes in scope and by the reduction in the
average presence of employees.

The portion allocated to the shareholders of Hera Spa and the minority shareholders of the subsidiaries
rose by Euro 6.7 million (+4.3%) and equates to 10.6% of the total, similar to last year. Of this portion, Euro
148.9 million was allocated as dividends distributed to Hera Spa shareholders (up 5.2% compared to 2017,
following the increase in the dividend from 9.5 Euro cents per share to 10), and Euro 14.7 million was
allocated as the portion of earnings pertaining to the minority shareholders of the subsidiaries of Hera Spa.

A portion totalling 33.6% of the value added generated in 2018 was re-invested in the company. This
portion increased with respect to 2017 (+8.1%) and includes the net profit for the year not allocated to
shareholders (Euro 133.0 million, up Euro 23.1 million compared to 2017) and amortisation/depreciation of
investments made (Euro 385.3 million, up Euro 15.6 million compared to 2017); the increase is due to new
