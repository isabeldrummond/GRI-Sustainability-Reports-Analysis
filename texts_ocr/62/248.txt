The Plan takes into account only the risk factor arising from the formation of ice and snow sleeves; the
corresponding mechanical stress on the conductors of overhead power lines have been calculated in
accordance with the provisions of the standards EN 50341-1 and EN 50341-13.

The scope of the Plan was defined on the basis of the mechanical stress and the mechanical characteristics
of the conductors, the geometric characteristics of the lines and their geographical and altimetric location.
It includes the municipalities of Fanano, Fiumalbo, Guiglia, Lama Mocogno, Montecreto, Montese, Pavullo
nel Frignano, Pievepelago, Polinago, Riolunato, Sestola and Zocca.

The Secondary Cabins included in the scope of the Plan have been identified as those that supply the most
critical low-voltage users, for whom measures are necessary to reduce the risk of disruption to acceptable
levels by upgrading the power supply lines.

The type of measures adopted to address such critical issues consists in replacing the sections of bare
overhead conductors whose sections are not suitable to withstand the stresses considered, with overhead
cables with spiral reinforcements of an appropriate section, initially expected to follow the same route of
the existing lines.

We analysed the medium-voltage distribution network to identify the measures, considering the best
power supply route for the most critical stations, along which all the sections of overhead conductors with
an unsuitable section were identified and which must therefore be replaced with overhead cables with
spiral reinforcements.

The Plan involves the refurbishment of 8 lines, covering the period 2018-2023.

At Hera we drink tap water

The Hera2O project, launched in 2008, encourages Hera’s employees to drink tap water. By drinking over
506 thousand litres of tap water in 2018 from the 118 dispensers installed in Hera’s canteens and offices,
workers avoided the production of more than 16 tonnes of plastic, equivalent to around 510 bins, and over
780 plastic bottles (0.5 litre bottles were considered for canteens and individual use, and 1.5 litre bottles
for offices and meeting rooms). This virtuous behaviour generated an energy savings of approximately 52
tonnes of oil equivalent and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 146 tonnes.

Urban Springs

Residents can also have good and checked drinking water by obtaining it from the Urban Springs, public
dispensers of drinking water, located throughout Hera Group’s service area. The water they provide is
identical to that in the taps of homes but is cooler (refrigerated) and sparkling water is also dispensed. In
2018, there were 69 “Urban Springs” in the area served by Hera Group while there were 5 dispensers in the
area served by AcegasApsAmga; the number of “Urban Springs” set up jointly with Marche Multiservizi
increased to a total of 15.

We would like to mention the considerable environmental benefits deriving from the decision to drink tap
water, which is good, safe and scrupulously checked by the Hera Group. For example, in 2018 the Group’s
“Urban Springs” supplied a total of more than 20.7 million litres of water, 30% of which was sparkling
water, determining a remarkable saving in terms of plastic, as that amounts to over 13.8 million bottles,
and in turn means around 17,200 fewer bins to empty (bins with an average capacity of 800 1.5 litre PET
bottles), thus reducing CO2 emissions by over 2,500 tonnes. The savings for families, of the average expense
to purchase mineral water, is around Euro 3.8 million.
