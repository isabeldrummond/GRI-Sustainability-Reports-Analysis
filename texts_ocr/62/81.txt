The plant by-products increased because of a greater production of leachates in landfills due to the higher
rainfall in 2018 compared to the previous year, which was characterized by an extraordinary drought.

The data concern plant incoming waste. Duplication may therefore occur. Some of the waste treated in selection
plants, for example, may be disposed of in landfills following selection. The outgoing waste from plants, which has
therefore been included among the final-use plants, was subtracted from the quantities treated in the separation
plants.

Waste treatment increased by 7.2% compared to 31 December 2017. In this regard, notably smaller
quantities sent to landfill, while the quantities treated in the waste-to-energy sector increased slightly over
the previous year. The increase in quantities at the selection plants is due to the higher quantities treated,
mainly at the Castiglione delle Stiviere plant. The lower quantities in composting and stabilization plants are
mainly due to scheduled maintenance activities on some plants for regulatory compliance. The higher
quantities in the chain of stabilization and chemical-physical plants are due to the increase in leachates
from landfills due to the greater rainfall. Lastly, the third-party plants/other plants sector benefited from
the higher quantities treated by Waste Recycling and the increase in by-products treated in third-party
plants.

The circular approach within the Hera Group

Waste produced by the company

In 2018, excluding AcegasApsAmga, the Group produced around 2.8 million tonnes of waste. Compared to
2017 (2.3 million tonnes), the total number of sub-products leaving Herambiente Group’s plants increased,
as a result of the higher volumes handled. In particular, there were higher discharges from
landfills/composters (leachate) and chemical-physical facilities, as a result of greater rainfall and the
expansion of industrial activity (Waste Recycling), and from selection plants due to an increase in the
amount of waste treated and the identification of outputs at the Castiglione plant.
