Consolidated Law for the regulation of the quality and rates of gas distribution and metering services for
regulatory period 2014-2019 (TUDG) establishes that, from 1 January 2015, the fixed rates of the obligatory
distribution tariffs are structured by metering unit class (meter class) while the G4 metering class has been
taken as the reference for an average family that lives in the municipalities served. Specifically, the
obligatory tariff levels for the distribution services and natural gas metering for January-December 2018
were approved by resolution 859/2017/R/gas of December 2017.

The distribution tariff impacted on average 12% of the total bill in 2018. Part of the distribution charge
includes components to cover general gas system costs (such as energy saving promotion costs) which the
individual distributors treat as contra-items, paying the resulting revenue to the Cassa per i Servizi
Energetici e Ambientali (Energy and Waste Management Services Fund). These bill components are
included in the “system charges” item. In 2018, system costs remained substantially unchanged compared
to 2017.

The sales quota relating to the economic conditions of the supply for the protected service, defined by
ARERA, is governed by ARG/gas resolution 64/2009 (Consolidated act for the retail sale of gas). This
resolution defines the protected service economic conditions for entitled customers. In 2011, AEEGSI
started a reform of these conditions. Its implementation started with ARG/gas resolution 116/2012, which,
by transposing the indications laid down in Decree Law 1/2012, changes the previous indexing mechanism
(bound to a basket of oil products to which the purchase formulas of the long-term procurement contracts
entered into by leading Italian importers refer) with gradually increasing indexing based upon the gas
wholesale market. In 2016, raw material costs were indexed according to the gas price of the Dutch hub
TTF, which reflects the costs of the European market. The tariff components that together make up the raw
material purchase costs in 2018 account for 40% of the total bill. Resolution 916/2017/R/GAS updated the
level of the retail sales component (QVD), recording a slight increase in the same, from January 2018
compared to 2017. In the event of payment of the amounts by direct debit and electronic billing, Resolution
610/2015/R/COM introduced, for the economic protection conditions, a bonus that is worth Euro 5.4 for
the year 2018.

Lastly, in 2018, taxes account for 39% of the total, on average. These taxes are due to the State and
regional government authorities (consumption tax, additional regional tax and VAT). Taxes are set by
specific provisions by the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and the regional government authorities,
and vary according to the use of the gas, whether for heating or only for cooking or industrial uses. Since
January 2008, 10% VAT is applied for up to 480 m? annually, and above that, VAT is set at 22% under
Decree Law 76/2013.

Bill for a residential customer with 3 kW contract, whose yearly consumption totals 2,700 kWh, with direct debit and
electronic billing. A customer of the market with the highest protection was considered, based on the economic
conditions set by the Regulatory Authorities: 20% of Hera’s residential customers are in this category. Cities
considered: Modena, Imola and Trieste (weighted average of inhabitants). The grey areas show tariff components that
are not attributable to Hera.
