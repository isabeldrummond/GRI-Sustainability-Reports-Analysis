from a ten-year long integration of prospective sustainability within the Group’s strategy, may already
report a significant portion of shared value expressed through services, activities geared towards the local
area and industrial projects. The valuation with regard to the EBITDA reported for the year is the portion of
industrial income directly attributable to the Group’s activities, related to the total economic value
distributed to stakeholders throughout the areas, and detailed in the relevant section in this Report.

“Shared value” EBITDA

The Hera Group continues to report “shared value” EBITDA (started for the first time with the 2016
sustainability report), i.e. the portion of EBITDA resulting from projects and activities that respond to the
“calls to action” classified in the three CSV Drivers: in 2018, this value totalled Euro 375.2 million (equal to
36% of the total), a 14% increase compared to the previous year. This result is in line with the 2018-22
Business Plan, created so that approximately 40% of 2022 EBITDA will derive from business activities that
respond to the priorities of the global sustainability agenda.

A roughly 14% increase in “shared value” EBITDA is recorded against a 5% increase in the Group’s overall
EBITDA (equal to Euro 1,031 million) compared to the previous year.

The prevailing contribution derives from activities and projects related to the efficient use of resources
(Euro 260.6 million), followed by those related to innovation and contribution to development
(approximately Euro 78.2 million). The smart use of energy accounts for Euro 66.9 million in 2018.

The total shared value EBITDA does not correspond to the sum of EBITDA of the single drivers, due to activities that affect several components.
Reduction of GHG emissions: sum of Spreading renewable energy and Promotion of energy efficiency.

As pointed out in the diagram, around 70% of “shared value” EBITDA generated in 2018 is mainly the result
of activities and projects that meet the “calls to action” of the 2030 UN Global Agenda for an “efficient use
of resources”. As regards “Impact Area”, the key role played by the Group in creating value with activities
related to the transition to a circular economy (+28% compared to 2017) and to the sustainable
management of water resources (+8% compared to 2017) emerges.

Around 17% of “shared value” EBITDA was instead generated from activities belonging to the Global

Agenda areas that lead towards a “smart use of energy”. 70% of this share of EBITDA comes from

initiatives aimed at the promotion of energy efficiency, through the development of commercial offers to

Group customers and the reduction of internal energy consumption, with particular attention to water
