applications were also accompanied by a specific “Health impact assessment and proposed health
monitoring plan”.

Once all impacts have been assessed, specific mitigation measures are identified, where necessary, in order
to reduce their impact and, where that is not possible, specific compensatory measures are prepared
(construction of photovoltaic plants, planting trees, construction of charging stations for electric vehicles,

etc.).

It must be noted that the design of the works is always carried out by identifying and using the best
available technologies as required by Legislative Decree 152/06 as amended and Article 29 bis, paragraph 3,
which, for landfills, are defined by Legislative Decree 36/03.

The following Environmental Impact Assessment applications were activated in 2018:

Volumetric recovery at a higher level of the landfill for non-hazardous waste located in the
municipality of Sommacampagna (VR)

The project presented is for a variant of the authorized project and involves increasing the recovery
volume by raising the existing landfill and building the final covering with geosynthetic materials
instead of gravel and clay. These changes, while exploiting the landfill reservoir differently than
envisaged by the authorized project, are aimed at ensuring its full environmental safety from a
technical point of view, and an adequate, optimal and precautionary post-mortem management of
it. The raised recovery volume not only exploits the landfill’s volume better, but enables the
construction of new slopes new slopes that ensure a rapid flow of surface water, avoiding the
formation of pools or damp areas. The final outcome of the work, filling the initial excavation of the
former quarry, has positive effects on the surrounding landscape. Compared to the current
situation, in fact, the quarry excavation, which was initially clearly visible from three sides, at the
end of the work, despite the presence of a morphological element that rises above the ground
level, will be shielded to a great extent by a perimeter tree barrier and the new plantings in fact
significantly enrich the vegetation on the site. The change of the final roofing package, using
geosynthetic materials instead of raw materials, optimizes the construction methods and timing of
the final roofing, and saves natural resources. Further positive aspects in terms of reducing
environmental impacts concern in particular the atmosphere. In fact, the use of geosynthetic
materials, delivered in rolls, involves a lower number of vehicles circulating, thus reducing the
vehicular traffic and the related dust and noise emissions. Laying these materials also produces
lower dust emissions compared to the use of inert material and the related operations of unloading
it and storing it in heaps.

The modelling evaluations we carried out on the dispersion of odorous substances in the
atmosphere have shown that, also thanks to the biogas collection network, which is also planned
for the raised portion, the project does not cause significant changes with respect to the currently
authorized condition. The noise impact assessment shows that all receptors complied with the zone
limits.

We also assessed the influence of the work planned on the sites of the Natura 2000 network and in
particular on the sites closest to the landfill, which are, however, more than 5 km from the landfill.
These assessments showed that the project did not have a significant impact on these sites and
therefore it was not necessary to prepare an impact assessment.

Revamping of the F3 line of the waste-to-energy plant for industrial, municipal and special waste,
including hazardous waste, located inside the Baiona (RA) Ecological Centre

The revamping project for this line involves increasing the annual quantity of waste to be
incinerated by 10,000 t/year, through saturation but without increasing the thermal load of the
furnace, i.e. the maximum quantity of “heat” that can be introduced into the incinerator as waste.
