During 2019 we plan to extend the platform and implement artificial intelligence algorithms to create a tool
capable of optimizing the purification processes.

Utilities 4.0: Robotic process automation

A new Robotic Process Automation platform was launched in 2018, to automate processes that involve
interaction with repetitive and low value-added systems. The experimentation of the technology, carried
out with the specific aim of testing its potential, has given extremely satisfactory results in the two
processes involved (management of the DURC of suppliers and management of communications between
the seller and distributors of energy), both in terms of speeding up the process, and consequent efficiency,
and in terms of reliability of the operations carried out. These first experiences will lead to enhancements
of the platform during 2019, creating a real “software automation hub” for operating processes that are
traditionally resource-intensive, but with low added value. The results in terms of potential efficiency on a
Group scale are certainly significant, but above all they will free up time.

Utilities 4.0: Optimisation of purification plants operation

The project, carried out on the Modena wastewater purification plant, involved the development, with the
support of Energy Way, of a control system based on predictive logic MPC (Model Predictive Control) and
artificial intelligence for the optimized supply of oxygen in the oxidation tanks. The project has the
following objectives:

- to improve the performance of total nitrogen abatement compared to the regulatory limits;

- optimize oxygen delivery in the aerobic compartment;

- minimize the energy costs of air blowers.

The project also included the development of a dynamic baseline aimed at forecasting energy
consumption, to quantify the real performance of the process and develop multi-variable, real-time energy
and production performance indicators (KPIs), aimed at improving control over the real performance of
the wastewater purification plant. In 2019, we expect to complete the field installation of the predictive
controller and complete the test phase.

Utilities 4.0: HergoAmbiente and data analysis for waste management services
In 2018 we added various Data Analitycs tools to HergoAmbiente’s system.

The Waste Management Services, therefore, actually fit into the world of loT (Internet of Things),
characterized by the production and consequent analysis of the Big Data system.

These tools are part of the company’s Data Management and, in addition to consolidating the system
through the introduction of performance indicators extended to the collection centres, they have also
consolidated the engineering of predictive analysis tools, aimed at comparative benchmarking and changes
in service logistics.

Particular attention must be paid to the development of operational research tools that improve the design
of collection services, and can quickly identify logistical scenarios and the related economic benefits.

In 2018 the analyses relating to the study of the degree of filling of the collection containers were refined
so as to understand the dynamics of the service with a view to aiming for an on-demand collection.

The experience determined the extension of volumetric sensors based on signal concentrators (LoraWAN)
in the Ferrara and Trieste area. The data collected have made it possible to understand the dynamics of
filling containers on the area, profoundly changing the nature of the service with the introduction of the
caps on the containers of non-separate collection and controlled closures on those of other separate
fractions.
