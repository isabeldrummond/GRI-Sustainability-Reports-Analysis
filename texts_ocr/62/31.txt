proposals, the commitment to energy efficiency achieved by installing low-consumption systems and,
above all, latest-technology LEDs, is particularly important.

The 2016 and 2017 data for the percentage of energy-efficient light points were recalculated on the basis of the
calculation criteria used in 2018.

In 2018 Hera Luce was finalizing many Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects using Project Financing ex.
art. 183(15) of Legislative Decree 50/2016. The projects presented include the energy renovation and
implementation of safety measures for public lighting systems, to comply with the Minimum
Environmental Criteria for lighting devices (Criteri Ambientali Minimi per I’Illuminazione Pubblica - CAM IP)
which came into force in 2017, and for the public lighting service — which came into force in 2018. Among
the criteria used to award the contracts, references to the circular economy and to presenting the material
balance are increasingly frequent. In this context, Hera Luce carried out the first national and European
case study of circular economy applied to public lighting.

During 2018, the work started in 2017 in 7 municipalities was completed and work started in a further 12
municipalities, of which 2 were also completed. Overall, the measures carried out in 2018 will allow a
saving of 8,739,000 kWh of electricity each year, corresponding to 1,634 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe).
Considering an average electricity consumption of a household of four people equal to 2,700 kWh per year,
the amount of energy that will be saved each year with the measures implemented by Hera Luce in 2018 is
equal to the annual consumption of 3,237 households. Lower electricity consumption results in over 3,500
tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions being avoided each year.

Particular attention has also been paid to the energy renovation of Hera Group’s offices: efficiency
measures have been carried out at the Viale Berti Pichat headquarters in Bologna — including the
spectacular lighting of the gasometer — and at the Ravenna headquarters.

Hera Luce continues the development activities related to various actions and partnerships launched in
previous years related to:

¢ update of the minimum environmental criteria for public lighting (MEC PL) and definition of the
new MEC Lighting Services, as a member of the working group created by the Ministry of the
Environment, Land and Sea;

e dissemination of the culture of light;

e developing a lighting device performance monitoring system in line with the MEC, together with
the Ministry of the Environment, Land and Sea;

e the development of models designed to provide local authorities with tools that enable them to
understand the process of analysing and assessing energy efficiency improvement activities, obtain
information on the activities to undertake for an energy renovation programme, and attain an
initial estimate of the costs of the measures and the benefits that can be obtained;

e analysis of new lighting technologies, assessing costs/benefits and future development options, in
association with several universities;
