Herambiente obtains the incentive through CICs (Certificates of Release for Consumption of renewable
fuels). The total amount of this work requires an investment of more than Euro 37 million, of which 33
million already accounted for.

Energy recovery from methane decompression

The project involves the exclusive development, construction and installation of an experimental system,
based on a patented technology, to recovery energy from the pressure drop in R&M stations. It is a small to
medium sized turbo expander (330 kW electric) installed in the medium sized R&M stations, in combination
with a heat pump that uses CO; as a heat carrier fluid, designed to use part of the electrical energy to
preheat the gas used in the process.

A contract was signed in 2017 with BHGE for prototype testing of the system and the design of the
prototype and the complementary works necessary for its installation in the “Ducati” R&M station in
Bologna were completed.

In 2018, we completed all the authorization activities, the supplier completed construction of the
machinery, all the necessary complementary works were carried out and the prototype itself was installed
on the site.

As planned, preliminary tests are underway in preparation for the start of the experimental operation
phase scheduled for early spring 2019.

Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions

Aliplast measures the carbon footprint of its products

In order to make available information on the carbon footprint (CFP) of some products, Aliplast has
developed a computer tool to rapidly calculate the CFP on five types of product: PE granules, PE films, PET
granules, PET plates, PET scales.

Aliplast commissioned this study to understand the environmental performance in relation to global
warming of the above products, and therefore the quantity of greenhouse gas emission per functional unit
of product (set as 1 kg), to identify the most environmentally critical phases of their life cycles and be able
to act to reduce their environmental impact. The method used is IPCC 2013 GWP 100°, version 1.03.

The project involved analysing the greenhouse gas emissions of Aliplast products and comparing them with
those of the corresponding virgin products. The result is expressed in kg of CO2 equivalents associated with
production. The CO; equivalent is, in fact, the measure used to describe the rate of emission of a mixture of
greenhouse gases with different climate-altering effects using a single index (the so-called GWP, Global
Warming Potential). CO. has been taken as a reference by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change) and its GWP set at 1. The other gases are therefore converted into CO2 equivalents according to
their GWP: for example, a gas that has climate-changing potential 21 times higher than COz, is counted as
21 tonnes of CO. equivalent.

The analysis showed that in 2017, the production of more than 80 thousand tonnes including PE Granules,
PE Films, PET Granules and regenerated PET plate, avoided the production of more than 150 thousand
tonnes of CO2, corresponding to more than 385 thousand barrels of oil. The CO2 savings obtained thanks to
the contribution of suppliers and customers who believe in Aliplast’s recycled products is equivalent to a
reduction of more than 100,000 cars in a year, equal to those of an average Italian city.

Aliplast intends to extend the analysis to all the Group’s production plants and to start from them to obtain
even better performance with its future industrial developments.
