e immediate access to technical information of user facilities;

e data entry and search with direct access to company databases (e.g. technical specifications of the
instrumentation supporting a specific activity);

e possibility of creating, updating, assigning, and reporting the various work phases directly from
mobile devices;

¢ optimization in the monitoring and scheduling of work orders thanks to the quality of data related
to the traceability of individual activities (time and space);

e possibility of direct, in-field readings of the meters;

¢ online and offline access to cartography;

e access and visibility of the data concerning the staff in service (e.g. on-call time, unavailability
bands, work calendars) in order to optimise the management of activities to be carried out on the
area;

e “navigation” function to the address of the call;

acquisition and consultation of multimedia documents (images, pdfs, CAD files, etc.) with the
possibility of attaching them to the work order.

All this translates into three terms that well represent what has been done: efficiency, performance and
satisfaction. The dissemination path now continues with the management of operation and maintenance
activities.

Utilities 4.0: Digital workplace

At the end of 2018, the pilot project (more than 100 users involved) of a fundamental component of the
digital transformation underway within the Group was successfully concluded. The introduction of the
Office365 Microsoft “Digital Workplace” will provide everyone with a modern technological architecture
on the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform, providing mobility, collaboration, integration, ease of use and
management, flexibility and security.

Workstations become a device like a smartphone, secure and always up to date, documents will be equally
accessible from all devices and all channels, continuous backup, services will always be available even in
case of problems to the corporate network, the user will be independent in the installation of business
applications and the mailboxes will become virtually limitless.

Also from the point of view of IT service management, the Digital Workplace provides enormous
efficiencies in terms of ease of installation and upgrades, self-service deployments, integration of
management and maintenance systems, advanced telemetry with identity protection, threat and breach
blocking, storage management, governance and data discovery in accordance with GDPR.

During 2019 and the first few months of 2020, the platform will be distributed to the entire population of
the Group.

Utilities 4.0: Senseable Dep: Sewage purification process monitoring dashboard

The project aims to create a platform to monitor purification processes by using simplified dashboards that
show just a few indices to summarize the “state of health” of the purification process from the biological,
hydraulic and energy points of view.

After the construction of this platform at the Forli purification plant, in 2018 the extension phase to the
Cesena, Cesenatico and Savignano plants began, purchasing the equipment necessary for complete
monitoring of the process.

In parallel, software optimizations to the platform were carried out to improve the quality of the indices,
graphics and user experience of the system operators.
