The conclusion of 7 interventions has made it possible to obtain significant environmental benefits, with
the reduction of the quantities of organic substances (COD/BOD) discharged into the sea during intense
weather events.

The measures planned for 2019 — the completion of the Ausa reservoirs and underwater pipelines, together
with the gradual separation of the networks in the northern area of the city — will lead to a considerable
reduction in the pollution load discharged near the shore, benefiting the quality of the water along the
coast. This will mean that the bathing bans laid down in the event of discharges being opened up to a large
part of the city’s coastline, including both those areas where the separation of the sewage networks has
been completed and the stretch of sea bordering the Fossa Ausa, will not apply. From this point of view,
since 2017 3,084 metres of beach have been “freed” from bathing bans and in 2019 we expected to
increase to 4,144 metres.

Moreover, as a further proof of the strong link between the Plan and the City of Rimini, clearly a part of the
interventions under the Plan will be integrated into the broader coastal redevelopment project called Sea
Park, so as to pursue synergies that can provide an overall improvement of the urban structure of the city.
