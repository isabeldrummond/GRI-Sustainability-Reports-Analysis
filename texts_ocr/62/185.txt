also extending the field of application of the certificates to the public lighting and traffic light system
service, acquired during the year. Mention is made of the up-date of the ISO 9001 certification in line with
the new review of the standard (ISO 9001:2015) and the attainment of the UNI CEI 11352:2014
Management of energy for companies which provide energy services (ESCO) certification.

In 2018, the first Group review was completed in which for the first time the results of the various
management systems on the main environmental and safety aspects were presented to the Senior
Management of the Group. This review provided Senior Management with elements for identifying new
opportunities for synergy regarding the system aspects so as to achieve increasingly challenging objectives
in terms of standardisation and simplification.

On a consistent basis, periodic alignment encounters were also launched between the company structures
which see to the environmental, safety, quality and energy management systems. These encounters, with a
view to collaboration and discussion, encourage the exchange of information and the achievement of the
standardisation and alignment objectives between the Group companies.

Hera’s commitment to quality, safety, environment and social responsibility

Quality management systems establish the requirements that are necessary in an organisation to improve
corporate processes in order to increase the satisfaction of final customers, who receive the end benefits of
Hera’s services. The high diffusion of the Group’s certified management systems is shown in the following
table.

Hera adopted a process during 2018 which concerns the entire certification system of the Group. Within
this context, the possibility of obtaining the new UNI ISO 37001 certification for the prevention of
corruption for Hera S.p.A. was assessed, the changeover from the OHSAS 18001 to the ISO 45001 was
analysed and in conclusion a possible simplification of said certification was assessed.

The international SA8000 standard, for example, has by now become a consolidated company asset, deep-
rooted at every level in the various daily practices of Hera’s activities. Certification of this kind for the
Group also presents a number of aspects of overlapping with other certifications such as the OHSAS 18001
relating to health and safety. With regard to Hera S.p.A. and AcegasApsAmga S.p.A. the decision was
therefore made to archive the fulfilment of a formality abundantly outdated by the standards and the
performances which the company automatically establishes, as also emphasised by the certifying bodies
which have several times remarked on the efficiency of the control system on the suppliers, the careful
management of the findings and an elevated supervision of the management system. SA8000 will by
contrast be maintained for Hera Luce S.r.l. and AcegasApsAmga Servizi Energetici S.p.A., in awareness of its
importance for the purposes of participation in the tenders.

The rooting of the principles sanctioned by SA8000, therefore, is not in discussion and continues to be
applied in all the Group companies by means of the corporate Code of Ethics whose principles already
ensure a more ample coverage of the same SA8000.
