Administrations deriving from Hera Group awarding contracts to social cooperatives can therefore be
considered around Euro 3.4 million for 2018.

Hera contributed to the inclusion in the national collective agreement for waste management services
(renewed in July 2016) of a specific protection clause for outsourcing in favour of social cooperation. This
clause sets forth that a portion of outsourcing for the sweeping, collection, waste transportation activities,
cleaning of septic tanks and cleaning of bins, is excluded from the requirement to apply the waste
management services Italian collective labour agreement, via the definition of socially inclusive projects.
This portion is 5% and can be raised to 15% at company level. Hera applies 15% on the basis of an
agreement entered into in March 2012 with the trade union organizations and with the Group’s union co-
ordination.

Protected categories among Hera’s workforce

In all the provinces in which it operates, Hera complies with the obligations of Law no. 68/1999, which
requires that personnel belonging to protected recruitment categories be hired in the proportion set forth
in that law.

According to the regulations on the rights of people with disabilities to work, companies that, due to the
special conditions of their business, cannot provide jobs to the entire percentage of entitled (disabled)
workers, may apply for partial exemption from the obligation to hire on condition that they pay to the
Regional Fund for the Employment of Disabled People a sum equal to Euro 30.64 for each worker not
employed and for each working day not worked; the maximum percentage allowed is 60%. Hera also uses
this option, which requires payments to the provincial governments by the individual Group companies if
they employ fewer disabled people than required by law.

This regulation, that promotes the recruitment and integration into the working world of certain categories
of people (disabled, orphans, etc.), also requires that the worker’s employment placement must abide by
solutions agreed among the company, the regional employment office and the worker.

At the end of 2018, there were 394 persons belonging to the categories protected by Law no. 68/1999
working in Group companies: 327 (230 Hera, 69 AcegasApsAmga and 28 Marche Multiservizi) are present
pursuant to art. 3 of the law (disabled).
