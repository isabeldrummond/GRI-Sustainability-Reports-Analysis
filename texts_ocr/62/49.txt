Efficient use of resources

Objectives and performance

What we said we would do

 

¢ Continue implementing projects that
prevent municipal waste:

- extension of “Farmacoamico”
(“MedicineFriend”) (increase of the coverage
rate to 50% of the residents served in Emilia-
Romagna in 2018);

- start construction of “reuse areas” at waste
collection centres.

i aN ENN TT)

© 48% coverage rate of “Farmacoamico” of ER
residents served in Emilia-Romagna (was

44% in 2017); started up the first reuse area

for the “Cambia il finale” (“Change the

Ending”) service in Ferrara.

 

e Extend quantity-based tariff for municipal
waste to a further 100,000 inhabitants in
2019. Complete the extension to all the
municipalities served, by end 2021.

@ 100 thousand additional residents under ER
quantity-based tariff in Emilia-Romagna since

2019. The total number of residents involved

in Emilia-Romagna exceeds 13% in 15
municipalities.

 

Municipal waste: increase the recycling rate
to 60% by end 2021 and the recycling rate for
packaging to 70%.

© The recycling rate of packaging was 70% in ER
2017 (compared to 68% in 2016). The overall
recycling rate was 48% in 2017 (compared to

47% in 2016). The 2018 data will be

accounted for in the “Tracking Waste”

report.

 

Municipal waste: continue to reduce landfill
use: <5% in 2018 and about 3% in 2021 at
Hera Group level.

© 4.5% municipal waste disposed of at ER
landfills in 2018 on the total municipal waste
collected (-45% compared to 2017).

 

¢ Municipal waste: increase separate
collection: 60.6% in 2018 and 70% by end
2021 at Group level and extend the
Rifiutologo (Wasteologist) app to the Marche
region.

© 62.5% separate waste collection in 2018. ER
The extension of II Rifiutologo app to Marche
has been postponed to 2019.

 

e Industrial waste: supplement the waste
management offer for customers with circular
economy solutions and further increase the
recovery rate.

© 42% recovery rate (material and energy) of
the 480 thousand tonnes of industrial waste
managed by HASI in 2018 (was 30.5% in
2017). Commercial offers activated with
solutions within the scope of the circular
economy.

 

¢ Obtain the environmental permit for a
mechanical-biological treatment plant for
non-separate waste at Pesaro in order to
further reduce the use of landfills.

e The permit for the mechanical-biological
treatment plant for non-separate waste at
Pesaro will be requested in 2019.

 

Send to material recovery at least 74% of
the waste treated in the 5 Herambiente
selection plants and install crushing plants in
Bologna (in 2018) and Modena (start of
authorization process in 2018) to reduce the
use of landfills for the disposal of screened
waste.

 

¢ 77% recycling rate of waste treated in
Herambiente’s five selection plants. The
shredding plant has been installed in Bologna
and the authorization process for the
Modena plant is underway.
