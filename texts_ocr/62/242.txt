Safety downstream of the meter

As a result of ARERA Resolution 40/2014/R/gas, when a request is made to activate a gas supply and in
some cases to reactivate a gas supply, the safety of the gas system is checked. The scope of application of
the inspection regards only user systems with non-technological use of gas (e.g. home use, boilers for
heating etc.).

In 2018, a total of 4,587 safety inspections were carried out for Inrete, of which 3,594 were for new
systems and 993 were inspections on modified or transformed systems. Of the 4,587 inspections, 4,326
passed and 261 did not pass. In addition to the activities of the assessment structure, 161 cases were also
found to not be subject to assessment (e.g. Tariff T1 - Production) and were cancelled by the reference
seller.

When activating gas supplies, Inrete carries out another key safety check: the inspection of the actual
integrity of the user system (downstream of the meter) to ensure that there are no gas leaks from the
customer’s system, before activation of the gas supply. Also, if a fault occurs downstream of the meter, and
Inrete’s emergency service locates a gas leak in a final customer’s system, it immediately cuts off the supply
in order to eliminate the dangerous situation. The supply is then reactivated only after a qualified installer
fixes the system so that it no longer leaks and issues the resulting technical documentation that proves the
integrity of the user’s system.

As of 1 January 2017, the new enhanced insurance policy for final customers is in force in the event of
accidents caused by the use of natural gas and LPG supplied through the network. The new policy lasts for
four years (from 2017 to 2020) and has higher limits for fires and accidents. The changes were introduced
by ARERA’s resolution 223/2016/R/gas. In particular, under the policy, anyone using combustible gas
(natural gas or LPG) provided by urban distribution or transport networks, automatically receives an
insurance coverage against accidents that is valid throughout Italy. Final customers other than residential
or condominium customers using meters above G25 class and users of automotive methane are not
covered. Coverage is provided for civil liability toward third parties, fires and accidents that originate in the
systems and/or devices downstream of the meter. The insurance policy is stipulated by Comitato Italiano
Gas [Italian Gas Committee].

Continuity of the water service
The water network control activity index is expressed as a percentage of the network inspected for leaks.

On the whole, in 2018 over 9,610 kilometres of network were inspected by the Group, amounting to 27.7%
of the total network. In Emilia-Romagna the organization of the leak search activity was based on a
criticality analysis in terms of network losses, breakage indexes of the pipes and possible issues concerning
the availability of water resources (in particular during the summer).
