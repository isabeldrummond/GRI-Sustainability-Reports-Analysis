OBERALP GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

KEEP CLIMBING

We think the simplest way to find out how we're
doing is to ask our people — so every couple of
years, we send our ‘Climb Up!’ survey to every
employee in the company.

In 2018 we conducted a new survey. The results showed that our
employees are generally satisfied — the overall general satisfaction
rate is 81%*, up 2% from 2015. Employee participation in our
survey was 78%, up 13% from 2015.

It also showed that employees believe in and share our company
values. In terms of sustainability, 87% of respondents think the
company is very aware of its social and environmental
responsibility. Employees in Italy, Switzerland, Spain, North
America and Poland are those that gave exceptionally high
ratings to our sustainability efforts.

Other areas we look at in the survey include: employees’
thoughts on management and leadership skills, quality of their
work life, professional development, communication between
management and staff, work organisation, diversity
management and work-life balance.

The results of this survey helped us make an action plan for the
coming years. Currently, we are focusing on sharing the results
with teams to work on single areas of development. We are
identifying possible solutions to address the points that received
lower rankings, like work organisation and structure.
