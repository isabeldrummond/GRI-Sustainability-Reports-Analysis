REDUCING OUR
CARBON FOOTPRINT

Back in 2015, we conducted a Corporate Carbon Footprint
study on our entire company, to see where our biggest
environmental impacts are. This was the outcome:

DIRECT

INDIRECT | ppg, 4 qny:
IMPACT? 86% e144: IMPACT

Our environmental impact

Our study showed that over 80% of our impact is actually
related to our production. However, we don't own any of
our production — it's all outsourced, except for our skins
production in Switzerland. But this doesn’t mean we will sit
back and ignore the problem.

* Indirect impact refers to all our outsourced operations (production,
transportation, etc). Because a company has no direct control over them,
the responsibility is normally limited.

Some of what we've achieved so far:

- Our Code of Conduct, which all suppliers sign and agree
upon, sets environmental protection as one of the standards.

- We're bluesign system partners and many of our partner
factories are, too.

- Amajority of our suppliers are committed to using the Higg
Index™ as a way to transparently share, benchmark and track
the environmental performance of our supply chain.

- We encourage employees to organise car-sharing for their
business travels.

- Our car-free to work competition rewards employees who opt
out of commuting to and from work by car. In 2018, together
we commuted car-free for a total of 47,918 km, resulting in an
estimated saving of 11.02 tonnes of CO, emissions.

- LED lighting in shops: as of 2017, we only use LED lighting
in all new or renovated shops.

- In 2018, our global electricity consumption across all our
offices was 6646,45 GJ (1.846.235,06 kWh).

- We installed 9 video conference devices across the 4 countries,
where we normally commute a lot between offices;
to reduce the amount of business travel and increase our
work and meeting efficiency.

** The Higg Index is a self-assessment and benchmarking tool
for apparel and footwear industries for assessing environmental
and social sustainability throughout the supply chain.
