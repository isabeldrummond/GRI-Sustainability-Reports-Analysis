PROTECTING WILDLIFE

DYNAFIT: Snow Leopard Trust

The snow leopard is DYNAFIT’s brand symbol and
embodies its values and characteristics — a perfect
combination of speed, endurance and dynamism.

Sadly, it's been in danger of extinction since 1972,
with an estimated 4,000-6,500 cats remaining
worldwide. DYNAFIT is helping to prevent the
extinction of this species. Since 2007, we've
supported the non-profit organisation Snow Leopard
Trust, which works to protect this endangered cat
through community-based conservation projects.

   

We organise the Snow Leopard Day each year, a public ; 2018
ski touring event held in several locations worldwide.
