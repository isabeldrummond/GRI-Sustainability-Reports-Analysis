SALEWA: Sherpa Girl

In 2018, we started a new project called Sherpa
Girl, partnering with a small organisation that
works to give young Nepalese girls from poor
families access to education. In Nepal, many girls
are not allowed to go to school, because their
poor families need them to work in the household.
The donations made go directly to the families,
so that they can afford their girls not working.
Education is a powerful way to help girls build a
strong future for themselves and it is also key in
helping developing economies prosper.

With the help of the local organisation we have
identified 9 girls living across various small villages
in the Nepalese mountains.

Salewa plans to support these nine girls over
several years to help them complete their
school education.
