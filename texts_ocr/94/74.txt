POMOCA: new life for skin waste

In 2016, POMOCA decided to give a second life to its skin
waste material by partnering with Skinalp - a small company
from Aosta Valley, Italy, that produces accessories from

the waste of ski touring skins. With our production waste,
SkinAlp has created belts, key chains and bags. A portion of
the proceeds then go to a Nepalese non-profit that supports
housing for children.

In 2018 POMOCA launched a new innovative upcycling project
in partnership with up-and-coming Swiss company Baabuk.
By combining leftovers of POMOCA's brightly coloured skins
with BAABUK's natural felted wool we created a limited series
of fun, stylish and durable slippers!

 

 

Wild Country: Curbar Jacket

Textile companies around the world have excess textiles lying
around in warehouses destined to become waste. We think
these materials should be put to use. So we decided to get
creative with some of our leftover high-tech fabrics.

Engineered for climbing, the Curbar Jacket is made of
high-performance leftover material from SALEWA's production.
This collaboration between two of our brands means we're
creating something new and avoiding waste at the same time.

The jacket’s designed at the Wild Country base, in the heart
of one of the UK's most famous climbing areas — the Peak
District. Curbar offers robust and reliable weather protection,
and outstanding mobility that moves with you — ensuring
unrestricted arm-lift, even when the jacket's tucked under

a harness.
