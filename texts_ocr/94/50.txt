OBERALP GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

51

 

Between the three groups, we have around
170 disabled workers working on our products
—and, in 2018 we produced around 100,000
pairs of bindings and 50,000 spare parts with
the help of these workers.

We're proud to say that 100% of our
bindings are assembled by disabled
workers at these organisations.

 

We are proud to produce our bindings with
disabled people nearby our offices in Munich.
Even though this approach takes more effort

and time it is motivating for all of us how

these handicapped people have become a

crucial part of the DYNAFIT family.
