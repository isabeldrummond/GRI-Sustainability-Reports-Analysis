GETTING THE
WORK-LIFE
BALANCE RIGHT

We give all our employees responsibility
in their role. We have a goal-oriented
management approach, meaning we
trust our team as experts in their field
and encourage everyone to bring new
creative solutions to the table and think
outside the box.

We also use a third party to evaluate how
well we're doing at giving employees

a good work-life balance. In 2012, we
received the Familie und Beruf (Family
and Work) certification from the South
Tyrol regional government. Since then,
they monitor and evaluate our efforts

at our headquarters annually.
