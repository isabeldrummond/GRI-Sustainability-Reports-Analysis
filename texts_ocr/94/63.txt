WOOL

Wool's part of our DNA. The Oberrauch
family has been closely linked to the material
for more than 150 years. It also has a strong
connection to the mountains and our home
region, South Tyrol.

Using local wool for insulation

We can source wool locally, it’s biodegradable, and it’s packed with
benefits — excellent insulation, breathability, thermal regulation and
outstanding warmth. That's why we decided to focus on wool to
find an innovative insulation technology for our products.

However, it's not simple. The texture of wool from the Alps is

very rough, so it’s not usually used in clothing. Instead, it’s used as
a filling in building construction or even thrown away. Either way,
sheep still have to be shorn every year to stay healthy, so the wool’s
always there.

We wanted to see if we could do something useful with this local
resource, both to upgrade the material and to support the local
sheep herders. The goal? To refine this regional raw material
that's been tried and tested over generations with a pioneering
technology.

Peter Veider — director of the Tyrolean Mountain Rescue, who we've
equipped with gear for many years — came up with the idea:

“We wanted to equip mountain rescue teams with a natural fibre
from Tyrol. The plan was to minimise environmental impact with
shorter transport routes, while simultaneously supporting alpine
sheep farmers — from the mountains, for the mountains. Some of
the mountain rescue team own sheep themselves.”

The result of our hard work and strong partnership with the Rescue
team is anew insulation technology called TirolWool® Celliant®.

It's a blend of Tyrolean wool and the thermoreflective mineralised
yarn, Celliant®. Together, the minerals and the wool are excellent at
keeping heat in and getting rid of dampness.
