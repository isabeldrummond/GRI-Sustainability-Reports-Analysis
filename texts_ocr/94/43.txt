COMPETITION,
EXPERIENCES AND
MOUNTAIN LOVE

Sharing our passion for alpine sports with professional
athletes, adventurers or people who simply enjoy
moving in the mountains isn't just a good way to conduct
first-hand product testing. It also allows us to experience
the products we make and the lifestyle we promote
alongside our most important stakeholders: the people
that use them.

We host a number of competitions where consumers
can win experiences that take them to the heart of
the mountains.

 

GET VERTICAL >
SALEWA's Get Vertical is an annual competition that

enables participants to live a #PureMountain experience.

It's a chance for us to share our love and passion for the
mountains with our fellow mountain enthusiasts, and for
them to experience the intensity and pure beauty of the
Dolomites — the place we're fortunate enough to call home.

Each base camp experience hosts ten winners, who get to
test their limits and push themselves even further. There
are several opportunities each year to win a specialised
multi-day mountain excursion with alpine guides, a free
outfit and test gear — along with the chance to experience
a night in a mountain hut, and another sleeping under the
stars at high elevation.

The 2018 editions offered two summer alpine climbing
experiences and two winter ski mountaineering experiences
in San Martino di Castrozza and Obergurgl.
