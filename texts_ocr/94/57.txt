CHEMICAL
SAFETY

One of our top priorities is making sure our
materials and products are safe for both humans
and the environment.

Along with our in-house chemical management
expertise, we work with industry best-practice

partners to ensure the highest chemical standards.

Our goal is to control the entire lifecycle of
our products — from raw material, through the
production process, to the finished product.

It is extremely important to have a solid
system to ensure product safety and
supply-chain monitoring in order to protect
our consumers and the environment.

A product that poses hazards to people or
the environment is inherently unsustainable,
no matter what other sustainable
characteristics it has.
