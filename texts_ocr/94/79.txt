Logistics centre

Our central warehouse, opened in 2011 along with
our Offices, is built over four floors and is around
10,000 m?. More than 70% of our orders are fulfilled
through the automatic warehouse system, which
handles around 30,000 pieces each day.

The automatic system can't handle some items
due to their size (e.g. skis) so they're dealt with

by a manual warehouse system.

Sustainability and energy efficiency in
our logistics centre has been the focus
since day one.

- All cardboard boxes used both by us and our
suppliers are 100% recycled carton. We compress
all used cardboard boxes with our compressing
machine before sending them to a recycling
company.

- We monitor the time and energy consumption to
start up our machines so that a maximum of four
machines can start at the same time.

- We set the remaining machines in motion witha
time lag, because acceleration requires the most
amount of energy.

- We feed the energy generated during the braking
phases back into the system via corresponding
power feedback modules.

In 2018, we tracked the environmental
impact of transporting our products.
Overall, the majority of our products
are shipped to us by sea freight.

We try to avoid air freight where possible
and opt for sea freight, the more
sustainable option.
