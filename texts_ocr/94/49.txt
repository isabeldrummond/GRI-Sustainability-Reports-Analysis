EVERYONE CONTRIBUTES

POMOCA

At POMOCA we've been working with manufacturing
partners who support people with disabilities since
2013, and our work's grown exponentially in the last few
years. People with mental disabilities contribute to the
production on our ski skins, doing tasks like stitching,
packing and labelling.

In 2016, we started a collaboration with social
organisation, Polyval. Polyval started by doing some
basic tasks, like assembling plastic parts and preparing
our product bags. We have started to give more
complicated tasks to their workers — engaging them in
our business, making them feel valuable and keeping
them motivated.

 

DYNAFIT

We started working with Caritas at DYNAFIT in
1999. It's an organisation that enables disabled
people to enter the world of work by providing
facilities that cater to their specific needs — so
they get the independence, involvement and
recognition that we believe they deserve. We are
working together with Caritas on a unique project
in one of its facilities in Germany, where a team of
disabled workers assemble our ski bindings.

Thanks to the success of the partnership — and
with our production needs on the rise — we started
working with two similar organisations in 2016 and
2017: Herzogsagemithle Werkstatt Peiting

and Barmherzige Bruder Algasing.

Both non-profit organisations enable disabled
workers to gain practical experience and
professional independence. Their workers are
also involved in the production of our ski touring
bindings.
