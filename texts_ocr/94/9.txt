Empowering freedom of
movement in the mountains

SWISS BI MADE

POMOCA is the world market leader for ski touring
climbing skins, developed and produced in Switzerland.
It’s also a centre of excellence for mountain and trail
running outsoles. The brand has been producing
exclusively in Switzerland since 1933, growing from
being the sole supplier for the Swiss Army to a specialist
in the development of technologies that enhance
mountaineering equipment with adhesion, friction and
gliding properties.

POMOCA's products are among the series winners in

the world's ski touring skin tests, winning over 80% of
the medals in international races. Athletes consider pink
POMOCA racing skins to be the standard. In addition to
its function as a product brand, POMOCA also acts as an
ingredient brand for many established ski mountaineering
brands — including those within the Oberalp Group.
POMOCA's headquarters are in the French-speaking part
of Switzerland in Denges, near Lausanne.

Wild Country is the brainchild of UK-based climber Mark
Vallance. It was set up to manufacture what's become the
most famous piece of rock climbing gear of all time: the
Friend. Even today, Wild Country offers customers the
greatest possible freedom in their vertical activities with its
technical climbing products. It uses technology to reduce
the risk of climbing to the lowest possible level — exceeding
safety standards and setting them even higher.

Wild Country
Pure Climbing

Wild Country inspired a new era for rock climbing in the
1970s with the invention of the Friend. Since then, it’s

kept developing new possibilities for climbing through
pioneering technologies. With the Revo safety device, the
brand has set a new standard in the industry. Like a seatbelt
ina vehicle, the Revo automatically cushions a possible
rope fall without any additional intervention by the rope
partner.

Wild Country exports its products from Bolzano, Italy
across the world through its own online distribution.
