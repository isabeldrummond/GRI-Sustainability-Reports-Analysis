OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY

WE PRODUCE
MINDFULLY

Environmental challenges affect all of
us — businesses, people, nature and
future generations. We're serious about
reducing our impact across our entire
supply chain.

Circularity and upcycling
We want to close the production loop, and

every year we increase our efforts to reduce waste.

Our various upcycling projects turn leftovers and
wasted material into fun, useful products.

Reducing our carbon footprint

We're mountaineers and mountain sport
specialists, spending most of our time working
and living among nature and the mountains. That
makes us feel particularly responsible to protect
the environment.
