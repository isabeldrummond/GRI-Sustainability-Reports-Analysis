WHAT WE FOCUS ON

Our work on monitoring labour conditions focuses
mainly on suppliers working on cutting and sewing.

This is because:

- 78% of our turnover is from textile products*
(cut or sewn goods). Of these products, 64% were produced
in Asia or the Middle East. These regions are those that have
a higher risk of poor labour conditions.

- 22% of our turnover comes from technical hardware.**
And of these products, 89% are made in Europe, where
less monitoring for working conditions is necessary.

Most of our turnover comes from textile factories, and
this is where most regard for working conditions is needed
- it makes sense to monitor them more closely.

97% of our textile products in 2018 came from factories
where we monitored the working conditions.

* Textile products include the following: APPAREL (menswear, women's wear,
accessories). FOOTWEAR and TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT (shoes and boots,
tents, backpacks and bags, sleeping bags, cords, ropes, slings).

** Non-textile technical hardware products include the following: skis, bindings,
poles, shovels, probes, ice axes and screws, helmets, drinking bottles, climbing
devices like belays, carabiners, quickdraw carabiners and quickdraws,"friends",
rocks and nuts, pitons and rock anchors, and their accessories and spare parts.
