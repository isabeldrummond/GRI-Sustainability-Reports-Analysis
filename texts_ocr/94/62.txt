CHOOSING THE
RIGHT MATERIALS

We choose materials that make your excursions the

most comfortable and less impactful to the environment.

We are constantly pushing to find innovative materials
with high quality features. We want to find the perfect
balance between natural resources and the latest
technologies. We are always doing research to bring
new sustainable materials to the table.

We are now focusing a lot on a resource coming straight
from the heart of South Tyrol - wool.

Cruelty-free down and wool

We want to respect all living beings when making
our products. Wool and down are the materials
with animal origins that we use the most, and we
take special care to ensure that the sheep,

duck and geese are treated humanely.

All of our wool suppliers guarantee to avoid mulesing,
a practice that causes the animals pain.

POLYESTER AND NYLON

The most common materials in our outdoor apparel and
equipment are nylon and polyester, which are often blended
with elastane or cotton. We use these materials because
they have properties that are suitable for mountaineering
activities. They're light, extremely durable and strong,

dry quickly, have flexible colouring, and are easy to care for.

Increasingly, there are more sustainable versions of these
materials on the market. Recycled nylon is still rare but
recycled polyester has boomed.

Today, 12% of all the polyester we use as a
company is recycled. We want to increase this
amount substantially over the coming years,
while keeping quality and durability at the
centre of our material decisions.
