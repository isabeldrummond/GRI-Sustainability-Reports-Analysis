WHERE WE
PRODUCE

Most of our production is outsourced, meaning we do

not own any of our factories - apart from the POMOCA
production site in Switzerland. This means we have to pick
our production partners carefully and make sure we install
fruitful and long-term partnerships.

We produce our bindings, skis, ski boots, skins and some of
our technical hardware products - like via ferrata sets and
ropes - in Europe. This is because the technical expertise and
know-how is still based in Europe. We have also relocated
part of our footwear production to Europe, now making up
to 60% of the total. Producing close to home means we can
monitor every step of production more easily, checking that
it meets our safety and performance requirements.

Most of our apparel is produced in Asia. The center of global
know-how and cutting and sewing expertise is currently
located there, including some of the most efficient
production partners. But this means many of our factories
are far away from us, making it harder for us to monitor each
step of the process. Achieving fair working conditions in
these factories means we have to pick the best partners
and work with them to help them reach our high standard
of working conditions.

SHARING RESPONSIBILITIES

We do our planning, sourcing and purchasing
work in different divisions. Each division has its
own internal structure, strategies and partners.
But they all integrate due diligence and social
compliance in everything they do.

The Sustainability team, regularly exchanges information with
our sourcing and costing managers about local living costs,
potential hazards and geographical risks, and actual working
conditions. This means they can make informed decisions.
