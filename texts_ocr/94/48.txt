CHRISTMAS GIVING

Each year, during our Christmas dinners,
we organise a lottery to collect donations
for charity organisations and projects
around the world. In Italy, the total
amount collected from our employees is
then increased tenfold by the company.

In 2018, together we collectively donated
€42,000, split between three projects:

-acharity that supports those with severe
illnesses to fulfill one last dream

- financial support for the municipality of
Feltre, which was damaged during the
storms hitting Northern Italy in October

- the construction of a well in Kenya to
give an entire community access to
water for living and harvesting.

KEEPING THE COLD OUT

In 2018 we donated around 300 tent
groudsheets to an NGO working to help
homeless people in Berlin staying dry
and safe.

SALEWA'S GREEN FRIDAY

On Black Friday in 2018, SALEWA launched a "Green is the new Black"
campaign. Customers could buy our products at a discounted price and
10% of every online purchase was donated to the non-profit organisation
Protect Our Winters (POW). POW focuses on raising awareness and fighting
against climate change in the winter sports community. The campaign
was a success, with SALEWA donating a total of €13,000.

FIGHTING THE STORMS

In October 2018, Italy was hit with severe rains and storms. Thousands of
hectares of forest were completely razed to the ground, and landslides and
floods damaged large parts of the country. In particular, the northern regions
of Trentino and Veneto suffered alot of damage. As one of our main offices
is based in the heart of Veneto, we decided to support those affected by
the natural hazards, helping to clean up and rebuild the damaged areas.

Asa first step, we donated €11,000-worth of shoes to Montebelluna’s
civil defence organisation in support of the affected communities.

We also collected €13,000 of donations during our Christmas dinner to
support the Feltre municipality. They used the money to help families in
need by rebuilding damaged buildings and cleaning up destroyed forests
and hiking paths.
