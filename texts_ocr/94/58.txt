OUR CHEMICAL
POLICY

We launched the new Oberalp Chemical Policy

in 2018. It introduces a formal process to ban, or limit,
the presence and use of hazardous substances in our
products and production processes. This guarantees
safety and compliance.

The policy includes our Restricted Substances List
(RSL), alist of chemicals that are excluded or limited
from all our products. Our ambition is a best-practice
standard, and we update it every year to include the
latest research. Our RSL has been used internally
since 2014 — with our new policy, it’s now updated
and formalised.

All SALEWA, DYNAFIT, WILD COUNTRY and POMOCA
branded products have to abide by the policy.

It's a central part of the Conditions of Purchase with
our suppliers, and it's mandatory at every stage of
the production and distribution process.

More than 90% of our suppliers have already
committed to the Oberalp Chemical Policy.

PRODUCT TESTING
AND CERTIFICATIONS

Another way we ensure our products are safe is

by working with expert partners and third party
certifications. Most of the textiles we use in our apparel
are bluesign® or OEKO-TEX® certified — indicators of
high standards in safety and quality.

In 2018, more than 70% of our textiles were certified by
one of our partners. The remaining 30% were tested by
independent chemical laboratories to check that they
complied with our strict standards. In 2018, we conducted
more than 2,000 chemical tests on our products on over
3,000 chemical groups.

- OEKO-TEX® guarantees that no hazardous chemicals
are used in a material. Test criteria and limit values in
many cases go far beyond applicable national and
international standards.

- bluesign® takes it one step further: it guarantees that
not only the final material, but the whole process of
making it, is safe — ensuring safety for everyone involved
in the production.
