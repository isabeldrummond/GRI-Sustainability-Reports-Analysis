DOWN

Since autumn 2014, we've only used 100%
Responsible Down Standard (RDS)-certified
down in our apparel.

RDS is currently the most comprehensive animal welfare
standard worldwide, guaranteeing that ducks and geese

are treated well throughout their lives.

The standard is independent and is based on regular

checks and inspections that are conducted without warning.

We use down in a number of different products. SALEWA
chose it for 21% and Dynafit for 12% of its insulations in
their 2018 apparel collections.
