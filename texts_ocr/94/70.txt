OBERALP GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

We're proud to say
that in 2018, over 20%
of our apparel styles
contained at least one
recycled material.

Along with the increasing
use of recycled polyester,
we've introduced
recycled wool into our
clothing collection.

In my family’s business, the commitment
to wool has along history. Since generations
wool has been used in our home region as
a technical material.

We have the ambition to continue to further
explore the use of locally sourced natural
materials in our products.
