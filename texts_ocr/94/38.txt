OBERALP GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

39

Improving working conditions in this global
economy is not just up to factory owners.
Itis the shared responsibility of many
parties, and requires trust, commitment,
collaboration, and time. FWF understands this
and has been a great partner along this way,
by allowing, pushing and strengthening us to
play our part and fostering cooperation with
other brands to increase our positive impact.

Internal supplier evaluation system

In 2018 we designed an internal tool to evaluate

our suppliers according to their compliance with

our Code of Conduct. We are in the process of
implementing and refining it internally, and then
plan to use it as a tool for dialogue and improvement
with the suppliers.

The tool will help us to monitor factories in terms of
social compliance and tackle recurring issues in
a systematic way.

By establishing a method to standardise audit
findings, which measures the weight of findings or
the urgency of tackling them, we will be able to rate
suppliers, compare them with each other, analyse
recurring issues and findings ona country or
product-process basis and provide better support
in tackling the problems that exist.
