Our own mountain sports brands:

We're the only brand house in the world that specialises in a single
theme — mountaineering — with our brands, SALEWA, DYNAFIT,
POMOCA and WILD COUNTRY.

We're passionate about mountain sports, which means we're the
main customers for our products. It's what drives us. Many athletes
also use our products, working with us to test and develop them in
the mountains.

Our partner brands:

We help a select group of international sports brands with
communication, sales and branding in Europe. We specialise in the
Italian market, but have built a reputation throughout Europe by
partnering with eight premium sports brands.

However, we're not a classic sales partner and distributor. Instead,
we're a solutions provider, offering the retail market a single
contact for brands that share our values.
