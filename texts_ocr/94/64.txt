CELLIANT

ENGINEERED IN THE
HEART OF THE DOLOMITES

In SALEWA's 2018 collections,
we used TirolWool® Celliant®
for over 60% of our apparel
product insulations.

CELLIANT’

Made From Nature
Celliant® is a blend of 13
different natural
thermo-reactive minerals.

Recycled Polyester

Celliant® is blended with recycled
polyester fibres, produced

from post-consumer bottles.

Recycled Heat

Keeps you warm and dry longer,
reflecting your body heat

back to you.

Better Performance

The insulation allows for faster
recovery by improving local blood
circulation and promoting oxygen
in your bloodstream.

Long-Term Durability

Wear it for years, put it in the
washing machine, get it wet; it will
continue to keep you warm.
