HOW WE MONITOR WORKING CONDITIONS

 

All potential suppliers need to go through a human
rights screening process and fulfil our basic criteria.

 

All suppliers have to commit to our Code of Conduct.

Y Audits

All suppliers have to agree to audits from third parties at least every three years.
These are conducted in the local language by teams of three experts to carry out
a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation: worker interviews, health and safety
check and thorough document inspection (payrolls, safety certifications, time
records). Afterwards, findings are shared with the factory and a report on the
findings is shared with us.

 

 

 

 

Worker interviews

We want to make sure that workers have a chance to tell us how they are doing.
So as apart of audits, a team of independent local experts interviews workers
about factory conditions. This is done away from the premises to avoid biased
feedback or retaliation against the interviewees. Workers know that their
commitments are anonymous so that they can speak freely.

 

VY. Corrective action plan

We turn the results from the audit into an action plan: a to-do list of specific
findings of things that need to be improved, with concrete targets and a clear
timeline. Things like a missing emergency exit sign over the entrance have to

be corrected immediately, but problems of worker overtime related to production
planning can be a longer-term goal. Together with our suppliers, we work out

a plan on how to solve these problems and how we can support them.

 

Our quality controllers regularly visit production sites. They're experts
on our social compliance requirements — and the eyes on the ground,
monitoring the working conditions in person.

 

_M: Factory training

Information is power. We set up training sessions in many of our factories
that focus on labour rights, social dialogue between management

and workers, or special issues like anti-harassment or age verification
depending on the needs ina certain country or factory.

 

/ Complaints mechanism

The Worker Information Sheet, listing workers’ international rights,

is posted in all our factories, has an anonymous hotline number or an email
address. Workers can use these to report problems. It's managed by FWF
and they forward the complaints to us so that we can solve them directly
with the factory.

We continue checking in with each factory until an action plan is
completed and problems have been solved.

 

Every year, we publish a detailed report on what we've done to improve
working conditions. Here's our latest Social Report.

A New audit
At the end of each three-year period, we conduct a new audit on our
factories. This builds on our previous findings and confirms progress.
