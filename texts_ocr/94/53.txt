POMOCA: Seal project with EOCA
Until the 1930s, climbing skins were
manufactured from real seal skin.

As atribute to this animal and a symbol for
ski mountaineers, POMOCA launched a
new project in 2016 to protect the Saimaa
ringed seal in Finland. It's been estimated
that there are only around 370-380

Saimaa seals remaining, all of which live in
Finland's Lake Saimaa. We support a project
managed by the Finnish Association of
Nature Conservation, coordinated with the
EOCA (European Outdoor Conservation
Association).

Kaarina Tiainen, together with the Finnish
Association of Nature Conservation, is
fighting for the protection of the Saimaa
ringed seal — the most threatened seal
species in the world. She mainly works to
raise awareness around the issue especially
with the inhabitants of Lake Saimaa, where
the species lives. This involves organising
events to promote alternative fishing
methods and appearing at festivals and

in campaigns.
