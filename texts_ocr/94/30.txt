TRAINING

If our employees are successful, then Oberalp’s successful.

That's why we're always trying to develop our people and
our teams — investing in training and development so that
we're ready for tomorrow's business challenges.

We work in an environment that's constantly changing.
So it’s crucial that we're continually updating our skills,
abilities and knowledge.

We believe that empowering employees and making them
feel responsible for their actions is the most effective way
to bring positive change. In 2018, we conducted four main
programmes.

People Development Training

In 2018 we invested in training our managers on how to
effectively lead their teams. More than 90 colleagues from
all our global offices took part in a two-day training course
which was conducted in 3 languages and comprised of

8 working sessions.

Retail Academy

We gave store managers and retail assistants training on sales
techniques, as well as company culture company culture and
brand identity. The training sessions were held in Italy and
Central Europe (Germany/Austria/Switzerland).

Sustainability workshops

2018 was a big year for developing our sustainability strategy
within the company. We held workshops with specific teams

to understand how they can integrate social and environmental
responsibility into their daily work. We also conducted
Sustainability training in some key retail shops to increase
employees’ awareness and knowledge when interacting

with clients.

We also support employees individually with training that's
tailored to their needs — like language courses, excel courses,
etc. — as well as educating them about sustainability.
