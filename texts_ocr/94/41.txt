SOME OF OUR SUCCESS
BEHIND THE SCENES-2018

In China

Work which exceeds legal limits (overtime) is a recurring
problem in Chinese factories. It may be due to poor
planning from the factory, or bad timekeeping by

the brands in defining products and order timelines.

After many attempts to identify the real causes at one

of our factories, we decided to carry out a pilot project
with a comprehensive questionnaire of all the stages
(from product development to bulk orders) to identify
how our product management could have an impact on
overtime. In that way we could adapt our processes to the
needs of the factory for the following year. We also shared
the project with other competitor brands sourcing at the
factory so that it would have a greater impact.

In Vietnam

We made sure a child worker could study instead of
working in a factory and guaranteed financial support to
their family. We also received a firm commitment from the
factory that they would stop hiring underage workers, and
put an effective age-verification system in place.
