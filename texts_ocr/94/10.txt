OUR PRODUCT DIVISIONS

Our four product divisions are responsible for
transforming our brand visions into product strategies.
They develop and propose the seasonal product matrix
by following the brands' briefing, contributing to the
product line development.

Each division is responsible for the complete product
development process, industrialisation and control
of the manufacturing process: project management,
product design, product development, sourcing and
purchasing, production planning and quality control
of all products.

They also identify new technical solutions and push
product innovation (in collaboration with the innovation
team) to meet the brands’ objectives, quality and
compliance requirements, and financial goals.
