. SALELA
Pure Mountain

SALEWA is a brand with the clarity and aesthetics for
the progressive mountain enthusiast. Those who wear
SALEWA commit themselves to modern thinking and
the mountain experience. It's not about conquering the
mountain and the summit — it’s about

a relationship with the mountain.

Regardless of the level of difficulty on the mountain,
SALEWA delivers equipment that blends the highest
functionality with the best aesthetics. Its inspiration is from
the most beautiful mountains in the world: the Dolomites
in northern Italy on the south side of the Alps. Salewa has
been committed to the mountain experience throughout
its 80-year history, since developing the first backpack for
an Andean expedition in the 1950s.

Salewa offers a complete, sustainable product range
—from tents to ice axes, wool to Polartec.
Its head office is in Bolzano.

DYNAFIT wy
#SPEEDUP emneir

DYNAFIT develops its products into a performance system
— by mountain athletes, for mountain athletes. It's all
about endurance and determination. The highest level of
performance and speed on the mountain is only achieved
when products are as light, reliable, and efficient as
possible. DYNAFIT's products are mostly made in Europe,
with materials and technology that work in all seasons.

DYNAFIT is used by top athletes in international
competitions, as well as the toughest terrains on the
world's highest peaks. This helps DYNAFIT develop new
products and systems that value performance and speed in
the mountains. The product range focuses on ski touring,
but also has a high-performance summer range — from trail
running shoes to technical clothing.

The company is based in Munich and will soon open a new
headquarters in Kiefersfelden at the northern entrance
to the Alps (planned for 2022).
