We continue to make great progress in the reduction
across the board in PFCs. But in the lack of good
alternatives and because we also have a responsibility
to ensure the safety of mountaineers using our
products, we continue to use PFCs in some of our
products (only short-chain, C6)

POMOCA: PFC-FREE PIONEER

POMOCA became a world pioneer when we introduced
the first completely PFC-free skins (including coating)
to the market in 2016. It was the result of many stages
of R&D and athlete field testing, starting back in 2014.

* The remaining 10% are our five different RacePro 2.0 skins.
They're PFC-free skins with an extra top coat of PFC treatment.

We're researching alternatives for this top coat but right now
this is the only treatment available to reach our desired quality
and outcome.
