SALEWA recycled down sleeping bags

The most environmentally-friendly down is recycled.

We developed our recycled down sleeping bags in 2015.

They're filled with recycled down and the outer shell
is made with recycled polyester fabric and bluesign®
certified zippers. We started selling them in 2016, and
we've since increased the production volume.

In our upcoming 2019 collection, all down used in
sleeping bags will be recycled. The other sleeping
bags use synthetic material.
