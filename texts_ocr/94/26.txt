We have a 360-degree approach
to human resources.

That means we think about every aspect of our employees’
development: training, workforce planning, talent acquisition,
onboarding and integration, performance management and
talent review.

Our company is full of active people who love the sports our
brands stand for and the mountains that we work in.

We trust our employees to be our biggest ambassadors.

If they help us hire someone, we reward them through our
Recruiting Referral Policy.

We consider people's soft skills, as well as their technical ability,
when we're hiring. Once they join, we make sure their start is as
smooth as possible with comprehensive induction and training.

We help all our people grow by reviewing their performance
annually. It's a chance for employees to think about what
they've achieved — and where they want to go next.

We examine these annual reviews for trends. For example,
we might see that we need to carry out specific training
that'll benefit our employees. We also look for future
priorities and needs.
