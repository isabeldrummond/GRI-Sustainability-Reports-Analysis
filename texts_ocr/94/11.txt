OBERALP GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

OUR RESEARCH & INNOVATION

In 2018 we launched our group wide Research & Innovation
team, a team of experts working on long-term product
and system innovations. Investing in innovation means
investing in the future, something the company is strongly
commited to. The team’s role is to support our brands

and product divisions by sharing technical know-how and
expertise around innovations and technologies.

The team will work closely with the Sustainability team,
as the outputs of both teams should tie together.

 

In Oberalp's Research & Innovation team we
aim to vision the future of our products and
services in 5, 10 or 25 years. To evaluate ideas
we have three main parameters: Does it help
the brand's positioning? Does it help sales
growth? Does it have a positive impact in
terms of sustainability? The wining ideas are
the ones fulfilling the 3 requests.

& Innovation Team
