AMISSION THAT —_ consumers
In 2017 we sent surveys to

EVE RYO N E DYNAFIT, SALEWA and Wild
Country's consumers. We

B E [| EWES | N wanted to know which aspects
of sustainability they think are

most important for our brands.

We make products for mountain lovers,
by mountain lovers.

But our mission doesn't just belong to us.
It belongs to our consumers, athletes,
owners and employees, too.

To set a mission that really matters to
those who matter to us, we must find
out their opinions.

ATHLETES

We're constantly talking with
athletes about how to make

our products better. Because if
they don't work for our athletes,
we've missed the mark. Their
feedback shows us where to

go next.
