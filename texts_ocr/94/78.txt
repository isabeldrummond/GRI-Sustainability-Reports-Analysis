OBERALP GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

Our headquarters and energy reduction

We opened the doors to Oberalp's new global headquarters in
2011. It’s the heart and soul of our company. A warm, welcoming,
ecological workplace for over 200 Oberalp employees. It's also a
second home to local residents, consumers, alpinists and more —
since the building offers a climbing gym, a centre for conferences
and events, a SALEWA shop, anda café.

From the start, we designed the building to be as efficient
as possible, minimising our impact on the environment:

- We have a photovoltaic system that produced 706.502,21 kWh
of energy in 2018, which we fed into the public energy grid.
The amount of solar energy we produced and fed to the grid in
2018 equalled to 132% of our energy consumption, helping us
compensate for our emissions.

- We've also worked to minimise our energy consumption.
Since 2012, despite the opening of 4 new office floors, we've
decreased it by 32%.

- Our heating and cooling system is based on concrete core
activation. Pipes run through the concrete walls and ceilings,
acting as large thermal storage units and regulating the building
temperature while saving energy.

- Next to our solar panels, we have a living green proof
that provides natural insulation.

- We manage 75% of all warehouse operations through an
automated central warehouse system, which features an
energy recovery function through the braking system.

Our overall energy consumption (electricity + heating/cooling) at our
headquarters was 2% higher compared to 2017. This slight increase was
due to a higher volume of merchandise handled in our central warehouse.
