OBERALP GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

Companies will increasingly be
measured by the contribution they
are able to provide to society.

Sales, profitability, growth and investment will
continue to be important but the most defining
measure will be how relevant a company is to the
community it serves.

The Oberalp Group is committed to behaving
and acting mindfully to the best of its ability.
We do what we do, because we know why we do
it - and we have clear ideas about how it should
be done. We talk about it transparently and
honestly. We say what has been achieved and
what still has to be achieved.
