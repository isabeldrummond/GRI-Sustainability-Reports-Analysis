What really counts at the end of
our lives, are the relationships
with people and how much
good we could do.

People are at the centre of what we do.

But caring for people means we need to take
responsibility for the environment we all live
in-more urgently than ever before. | believe
our immediate duty today is to ensure a fair
and equal industry, while sustaining a world
worth living in for generations to come.
