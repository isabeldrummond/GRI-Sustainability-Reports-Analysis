HOW WE EVALUATE
WORKING CONDITIONS
IN FACTORIES

Our code of conduct tells the world how we
work as a company and the standards we
stand by. Every one of our suppliers has to
sign and commit to it.

It borrows from relevant international human
rights treaties — like the International Labour
Organisation (ILO) core conventions — and it’s
in line with the FWF Code of Labour Practices.

Essentially, it's about sustainability and social
compliance. It's about behaving ethically
towards all workers and the environment

at every stage of the supply chain. And it's a
tool for employees and suppliers to know their
rights. The code of conduct is posted on the
wall in every factory we produce in. A hotline
is also available for workers to file a complaint
when their rights are not being respected.
