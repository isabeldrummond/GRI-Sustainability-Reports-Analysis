SALEWA: turning waste into resource

Our designers studied the entire production process for a
number of our products, and learned that they could use
the offcuts — pieces of fabric that are left after a garment's
been cut out —in other products.

In 2017, we launched our Sarner wool gloves, made of
offcuts from the Sarner hoody and Bergrettung

merino t-shirt.

In 2018, we launched our new smartphone insulator, made

of leftover material from the production of other products.

The insulator also has an integrated Recco® reflector

to help quickly detect missing people. This year we also
developed a beanie that uses leftover merino fabric from
the production of our t-shirts.

 

 

Upcycling t-shirts

In the apparel industry, non-used fabrics often go

to waste. That does not make sense to us. Together
with one of our fabric suppliers, we decided to make
t-shirts and fleeces from our leftover fabrics, and sell
them in our outlets.

From banners to bags

We change our in-store marketing banners every
year — but we don't want to see this material go to
waste. Since 2016, we've collaborated with social
organisation AKRAT to turn our marketing waste into
useful products, like pillows and string backpacks.

From basic to unique

When SALEWA changed its logo a few years ago,

we couldn't use old material like hangers anymore.
Together with students from the University of
Bolzano’s design faculty, we transformed leftover
hangers into design pieces. They'll soon be multiplied
by AKRAT and sold in local shops.
