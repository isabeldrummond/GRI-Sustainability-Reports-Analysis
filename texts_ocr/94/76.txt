DYNAFIT:
may nothing go to waste

DYNAFIT has also been working on
different projects to reduce their waste
to aminimum. In 2018 several upcycling
projects were launched.

The Battery Life Saver is a phonecase
designed to keep your smartphone
warm during your most extreme
excursions. The case has been
produced using leftover fabrics from
previous seasons, both for the internal
and external layers. Same goes for the
Removable Sweat Pad, designed and
produced with residual farbics.

Dynafit also decided to use leftover
fabrics to create bags for athletes.
These bags were then used for the 2018
edition of the annual ski touring race
“Trofeo Mezzalama". Each athlete was
given one of the bags.

 

Speedo:
upcycling waste to fashion

In 2018, we proposed that Speedo
sponsored a project from the IED design
school, which reused flawed racing suits
and accessories for a new fashion design
concept. This project generated six
innovative suits and outfits, giving these
materials a second life and avoiding more
waste. We also found a student to sponsor,
who then completed the project.
