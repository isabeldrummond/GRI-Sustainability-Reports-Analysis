RECYCLED WOOL, MADE IN ITALY

One of our bestselling flagship products, Sarner, isn't just
100% made in Italy — its wool is also 100% recycled.

Our partner in Prato, Italy, sorts discarded woollen goods,
mechanically processes the wool, and transforms it into
regenerated wool yarn.

The wool holds the Global Recycled Standard and Cardato

Recycled certifications, which guarantee recycled content.

These certifications also guarantee the highest standards
of respect for the environment — specifically water, energy
consumption and CO, emissions — and social impact.

Our supplier transforms the recycled wool yarn into high
quality woollen fabrics. Together we developed these
fabrics for our SALEWA Sarner jacket. Thanks to

the success of the product, we're introducing several
new styles that feature recycled wool in upcoming
SALEWA collections.
