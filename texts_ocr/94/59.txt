PERFLUORINATED
CHEMICALS (PFCS)

Perfluorinated Chemicals (PFCs) are a type of chemical
compound used to make everyday products resistant to
water, grease and stains. We use them in some of our technical
products to ensure water repellence and permeability.

Using PFCs for performance

PFCs guarantee best-in-class performance for technical
apparel that needs to be both water-repellent and still allow
humidity to exit. These qualities are crucial for professional
mountain expeditions — under extreme conditions, it can be the
difference between life and death. Despite years of industry
research, there's still no technology that replicates

the performance of PFCs.

PFCs and the environment

PFCs have been criticised because, in high concentrations,
they've been linked to negative health effects in humans and
wildlife. They're persistent, which means they don't easily
degrade in nature. PFCs can also travel easily through water
and wind. As they're easily absorbed in the fatty tissue of
living organisms, they become more concentrated along

the food chain.

PFCs look like a snake, with a head and a long tail. Different
types of PFCs have different tail lengths — the longer the tail,
the stronger their ability to repel water, but also the more
dangerous they are. That's why we excluded all long-chain
PFCs in 2014, as soon as we got to know of their

negative effect.
