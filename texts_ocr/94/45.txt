OUR SHOPS

Our shops are a place for us to meet our consumers
—to empower, engage, and inform. It's also a place for

consumers to develop their passion for mountain sports.

We organise a number of activities at our shops:

- Running test to try new shoes

- Excursions and hiking with shop clients

- Photography competition

- Evenings with brand athletes

- Book presentations (on mountains and outdoors)

Consumers need to know what's behind the product
they buy. It’s our job to communicate this information
transparently. That's why we're focusing on telling them
more about our sustainability efforts at our shops.

In 2018, we organised a sustainability training
series at a selection of our stores. We believe that
sustainability communications at our shops will play

an increasingly important role over the coming years.

From specialised products (like upcycled t-shirts in
our outlet stores) to Sustainability-specific

in-store communications and hangtags highlighting
sustainable product attributes — we want to give
consumers different opportunities to engage with
the sustainability missions of our brands.
