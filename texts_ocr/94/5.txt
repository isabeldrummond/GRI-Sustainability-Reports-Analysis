GROUP

The Oberalp Group is a family-owned company.

The Oberrauch Family has been working in the textile
industry for six generations. Anton Oberrauch founded the
family business back in 1846 when he started to import
quality textile products to the Italian market. In 1981,

the Oberalp Group was founded and started distributing
clothing and other sports products in Italy.

37 years later, we have around 650 employees. And we're
known for building great brands that make the highest
quality technical mountaineering products. Today, we're
active in the product design, development, production
and distribution of our four brands: SALEWA, DYNAFIT,
POMOCA and WILD COUNTRY.

We also use our management and distribution experience
to help our partner brands in the sports sector, including
Under Armour, Speedo, Fischer and more.

But while we've grown as a company, we're still a family.
And no matter how much we will continue to grow, our
people will always come first.
