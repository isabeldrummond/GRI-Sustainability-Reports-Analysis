WE AIM FOR
EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE

Caring for our consumers

We always focus on our consumers’ needs, ensuring

we deliver on the high standards of our products.

Our services include providing product information,
warranties and returns. We usually do this over the phone,
avoiding transportation to one of our labs.

We have two customer support areas. Our B2B function
handles our partners, who sell our products worldwide.
Our B2C function handles consumer requests through our
website and over the phone.

In our biggest markets, where we have more capacity,
we make repairs internally. Like in Montebelluna and
Ascheim, where we have experienced tailors who repair
various apparel items. For some other products, we use
external licensed and approved partners who support us
with our repairs and replacement services. In our smaller
territories, we mainly work with external partners to
ensure the best service.

In Central Europe, we have a Skin Service Centre where
Skins (DYNAFIT and POMOCA) can be renewed and set up
for the new season.

DYNAFIT & replacement parts

DYNAFIT believes that exceptional service

should be part of the user experience.

Bindings represent more than 25% of DYNAFIT's
portfolio, and ski boots over 20% of the portfolio in
2018 (based on sales). To make these products last
longer, DYNAFIT offers replacement parts for these
two product categories.

Our dealers are equipped with these spare parts for
the most common types of repairs. Service teams
in each one of our offices are always available with
help and advice for technical enquiries. When our
dealers are not able to carry out repairs themselves,
the products are sent to DYNAFIT for servicing.
