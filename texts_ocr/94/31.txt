CREATING A LEADING
MOUNTAIN EDUCATION
CENTRE

SALEWA's Alpine Campus lets employees attend training
and workshops to develop their mountaineering skills.
More importantly, it helps them understand the needs of
SALEWA's consumers.

In 2018, we organised two Alpine Campus events — a summer
and winter edition — with 50 employees participating overall.
Employees had the chance to take a five-day trip and get
professional training on different mountain sports.

By 2020, we plan to professionalise our training sessions,
making them available for people outside the company.
Our vision is to become the leading mountain education
centre in the Alps, hosting mountain enthusiasts from
around the world.

We live the mountains together.
Personal engagement is very important to
us — whether that be with our colleagues,
end consumer, or the greater community
locally and beyond. Beyond training and
skill development, it is also a chance for
participants to consider ways we can develop
our apparel and equipment to better meet
the needs of users.
