GIVING PRODUCTS
A LONGER LIFE

Probably the most important step in
reducing the environmental impact of our
industry is to go from the old "take, make
and dispose" thinking to a circular business
model. This means for example making
production efficient and recycling materials
for as long as possible. We are doing our
best to go in the right direction. Here are
anumber of examples of things we do.

SALEDA

SALEWA is committed to using resources
efficiently, producing its products with
the lowest possible environmental
impact. It's significantly reduced the
number of styles in its collection, without
compromising annual turnover, with the
2018 collection containing 18% fewer
styles than 2017. This reduction makes
the production line and material use
much more sustainable.

Long-lasting design
In 2018, 40% of apparel
styles, 60% of backpacks
and 100% of sleeping bags
were carried over from
previous collections.
This allows us to use
materials efficiently and
reduce leftovers.

We're finding ways to
minimize waste during
