MICROFIBRES

What's the problem with microfibres?

Microfibres travel easily through air and water. They're a huge
environmental threat, which scientists are still only starting
to understand. Some microfibres come from our clothes
during production and use. Because they're so tiny, washing
machines and purification plants can’t filter them all. When
we wash our clothes, they end up in our ecosystems

—and eventually in our food chains.

We want to be part of the solution

We've been involved in finding solutions to this problem
ever since we heard about it, supporting three different
research projects. Currently we're involved in the Microfibre
Consortium, founded by the European Outdoor Group in
early 2017, and the Textile Mission's project to find out how
we can reduce our impact.

While we, as producers, have to turn these technical solutions
into action, there are many things that you, as a consumer,
can do to improve the situation.

What can you do to help YS
stop microfibers? Lcd

1. Wash your clothes less often.
Each time you wash your clothes they break down
a little and release microfibres, so wear them longer
before you wash — and dare to be dirty.

2. Let your clothes drip dry.
Drying machines are torture for your clothes.
They cause big microfibre release, which means
your clothes are destroyed more quickly.

They're also one of the worst energy consumers.
The crazy thing is that you don't even need one
—your clothes dry fine without them, and your air
quality and energy bill will be happier, too.

3. Always fill your washing machine.
The fewer items you have in your washing machine,
the more they get hurt and release microfibres.
So fillit up!

MICROFIBERS VS. MICROPLASTIC?

Microfibers are textile fragments less than 10 micrometers. They can be
either synthetic or natural. Microplastic refers to either synthetic textile
microfibers from polyester or nylon or similar tiny plastic particles
coming from other industries.
