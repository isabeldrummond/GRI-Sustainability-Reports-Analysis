FROM CONCEPT
TO CONSUMER

The collection you'll find in our stores right now was actually
developed two years ago. Because while you're out there
enjoying our latest products, we're already working hard to
develop innovations for your future adventures.

DEVELOPING OUR
WINTER 2018 COLLECTION

This also means that changes we make to be more sustainable
are not immediately visible on the market and that the
information on the current collection does not reflect current
ambitions and achievements.
