METHODOLOGY
FOR CALCULATIONS

Our 2018 Sustainability Report is an important
milestone in our journey towards a transparent
and structured reporting process. It gives
details on our sustainability performance and
the industry's key indicators. And it provides

information on issues that affect our stakeholders.

We prepared this document in accordance with the GRI
Sustainability Reporting Standards issued in 2016 by the
GRI- Global Reporting Initiative. The breadth and detail with
which we cover issues in the Sustainability Report reflect the
materiality analysis carried out according to the approach
described in the paragraph ‘Approaching sustainability’.

This report has been prepared in accordance with the

GRI Standards: Core option.

Scope of reporting

The reported information and data refer to 2018 (from 1 January
2018 to 31 December 2018), unless otherwise noted. Any data
referring to previous years is presented for comparative
purposes only, so as to allow an assessment of the evolution

of our operations over time. Where the data comes from
estimates, it is flagged accordingly. The performance indicators
were collected on an annual basis and the reporting frequency
will be annual.

Our headquarters are in:
Via Waltraud-Gebert-Deeg Str. 4, 39100, Bolzano, Italy.

Calculation criteria

Several of our operating departments were involved in the
process of data gathering and report drafting, in order to shape
this report. One of our ultimate objectives through the report is
to strengthen our reporting system, and enhance the accuracy
and reliability of the information and data we provide.
