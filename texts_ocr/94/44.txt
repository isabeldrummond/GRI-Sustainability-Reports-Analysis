ce MOUNTOPIA ‘ag’

PYMPIFIT

  

DYNAFIT's Mountopia is a twice a year competition
that asks hundreds of mountain athletes to push their
physical limits to win an unforgettable, once in a lifetime
mountain dream.

In collaboration with GORE® and PrimaLoft®,

DYNAFIT offers winners a chance to win a fully-financed,
multi-day guided mountain excursion — chosen by

the winner.

In 2018, two editions of the competition took place. Both
editions called on 600 passionate athletes to set their limits
high and share their ‘Mountopia’ —a description of their
ultimate mountain sports dream. Ten contestants are then
selected to compete head-to-head.

We selected four athletes for the first edition of 2018.
They won the chance to live out their dream and climb the
three highest peaks in Germany and Austria — Zugspitze
(2,962m), Grossglockner (3,798m), and Ortler (3,905m),
the highest peak in South Tyrol.

We picked six athletes for the second edition of 2018.
They had the chance to participate in the Trofeo
Mezzalama, one of the most intense and highest alpine
ski mountaineering competitions in the world, with 45
kilometres and 2,800 vertical metres.
