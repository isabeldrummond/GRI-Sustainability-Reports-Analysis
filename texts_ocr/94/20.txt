OWNERS

We held a workshop with our
owners, the Oberrauch family. We
wanted to find out how they see our
sustainability efforts evolving, and
where they think we can make

the biggest impact.

EMPLOYEES

To create a truly sustainable
business, we need everyone at
Oberalp to believe in our mission.
So we sent our employees a
survey to see what they think our
priorities should be over the next
few years.

 

We are also constantly
exchanging ideas and
results with:

NGOS

Sustainable Apparel Coalition,
FWF, Greenpeace, etc.
