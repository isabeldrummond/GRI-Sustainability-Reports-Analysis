POMOCA'S PIONEERING
LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
ON SKINS

In 2017, as part of its commitment to reduce the
impact of skin production, POMOCA decided to
doa life cycle assessment (LCA) onits ski skins.
The aim was to find the biggest impact through
the lifecycle of the product and identify ways to
improve.

We did the analysis on our bestselling skin, which accounts for
roughly 80% of our production. The LCA was completed by an
independent partner for climate protection, myclimate, and has
been verified by a third party.

The LCA mapped out our production chain, with all the inputs
and outputs involved in creating the ski skin. This includes

the type and quantities of raw materials used, transportation
distances, energy consumption at the production facility, waste
produced during production and amount of packaging used.

What is a life cycle assessment?

If you want to reduce the negative impacts related
to a product, you have to know where to start. A
life cycle assessment (LCA) is a method to assess
the environmental impacts of a product - looking
at the entire life of the product, from extracting
the raw material, to the day when it becomes
waste. And all the steps in between such as
manufacture, transport and use. The results of
an LCA let you understand which steps in the life
cycle have the biggest impact. This way you know
what to focus on.
