IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS

MAKING BETTER TEXTILE
FACTORIES WITH FAIR WEAR
FOUNDATION

Back in 2013, we chose to partner with the most rigorous
labour conditions expert in textiles that we know of:

Fair Wear Foundation. This helps us ensure that we're
always putting the wellbeing of our people first.

Fair Wear Foundation represents the ideas and principles of
all parts of the industry — business, workers and civil society.
This means it can take a holistic and systematic approach
to improving working conditions. They don't just audit our
factories — they also verify that we walk our talk through

the yearly Brand Performance Check. The results are then
published both on their website and our own website.

In 2017, Fair Wear Foundation gave us FWF Leader status.
It’s only given to brands who are “doing exceptionally well and

operating at an advanced level” and “showing best-practices on

complex issues”. This tells us we're going in the right direction.

FWF's requirements get higher every year, and we're continually

being challenged to try harder. It's tough, but that's also what

we like about them. Because in the end we all want to see a more

fair and equal textile industry.

How Fair Wear Foundation works

Fair Wear Foundation (FWF) is an independent, non-profit
organization that aims to improve labour conditions in the
textile industry.

It performs and shares research on workplace-related issues,
provides a platform for open exchange of information with
other brands and stakeholders, and has available local teams
who carry out worker trainings, seminars, and audits. After
each factory audit, a corrective action plan (CAP) is made

and shared with management, and a timeline for
improvements is set. Another important part of FWF's work
is to help us handle worker complaints.

Partnering with FWF is a big commitment. Every year, it
reviews our work to see whether we're implementing our
code of conduct in an effective way. It asesses our internal
organization and processes, our approach and handling of
the year's main events, worker complaints and audits, and
gives us a rating in a report which is published on their website.
