MORE THAN WORK

We are a team of passionate mountain brand
builders and developers of technical and active
sports brands.

What makes our team unique is the passion and
motivation we all share. We have the privilege of
making our passion our daily work. This is what
makes us a strong, motivated, ambitious and
hard-working team.

People are at the heart of everything we do.

| love being in a company that thinks long
term and has sound values that transpire
in all senses, whether it be towards the
environment or towards the employees.
| enjoy working in an environment where work
and passion are combined and spending my
days around a bunch of healthy people.
