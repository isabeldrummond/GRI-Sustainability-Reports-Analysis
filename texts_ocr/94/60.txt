OUR PROGRESS ON PFCS

We've made a big leap towards reducing our use
of PFCs. The number of apparel items where we're
using PFC water-repellent treatment was reduced

by 22% last year.

Our 5 point approach to reduction

We are constantly looking for alternatives to reduce
our impact on the environment, while still protecting
our users. The process we have put in place consists
of 5"Rs":

6 Restricted use of PFCs to short-chained (C6)
ones, and eliminated long-chained (C8 and
above) ones

6 Rethink the need for water repellency treatments

6 Replace where water repellency is needed,
substitute C6 with PFC-free or best available
alternatives

0 Research and invest in our partners to advance
in the development of PFC-free water repellency
treatments
