OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY

HOW WE DO THINGS

As a family business, we choose how we do things.
We're not only interested in quarterly results.

We think long term. We think about the world
we're leaving behind for our grandchildren,

and their grandchildren.

Sustainability is a choice we invest in, because we
believe in it. It’s a crucial part of our company values
and daily business.

Back in 2010, we made our commitment to sustainability official

by creating a Sustainability Working Group. Then, in 2012, we installed
a Sustainability Department, today led by the Sustainability Manager
Alexandra Letts. We've created a sustainability roadmap to keep

us on track. Our team works to integrate sustainability into every
department and brand of the Oberalp Group and reports directly

to our ownership and our CEO.

We believe sustainability is not some distant goal, but a mindset,
reflected in our immediate daily actions and choices.
It's about how everyone of us chooses to do things. Every day.
