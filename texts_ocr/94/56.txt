LASTING QUALITY
IS OUR PRIORITY

Society's biggest sustainability
challenge right now is overconsumption.
Our grandparents only had a few jackets
over their entire lifespan — and we should
learn from them. Instead of buying a new
jacket every season, we should only buy
products we love, maintain them for as
long as possible and take pride in their
history.

This is why our products are designed to
provide security in extreme conditions
and comfort that lasts. We keep this

in mind from the first steps of product
development.

Quality team

Our quality team has two quality managers and 14 quality
controllers. The controllers work directly with production
sites so they can inspect each production lot and work
with suppliers to ensure our high level of quality.

Quality manual

We've created a quality manual that we share with our
suppliers. It sets out the stringent requirements that
we're aiming for, so that we're delivering best-practice
in our sector.

Quality gate

We have a quality gate for every stage of our
product development. Products have to fulfil certain
requirements before they move onto the next stage
of development, industrialisation or production.

Rigorous testing

Aside from the quality control during the development
phases, we use two main forms of testing on our
products — mechanical and chemical tests in labs and
field tests by employees and athletes. Both give us
crucial feedback on our products’ performance before
they go to market.

Listen and improve

Our after-sales service sends consumer feedback to
our technical team so that we can keep getting better.
