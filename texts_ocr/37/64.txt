ENI FOR 2019

Stakeholder engagement at local level

Responsible business management must also meet the needs expressed by local communities,
contributing to their medium and long term well-being. Eni considers the relationship with inhab-
itants of the host territories to be an important input. For this reason, Eni keeps track of all issues
raised by stakeholders and analyses them in an integrated way for each territory, to identify the best
actions to pursue sustainable development in synergy with local communities. In this perspective,
managing grievances (the claims or complaints raised by an individual — or a group of individuals —
pertaining to real or perceived impacts caused by the operations of the company) is a fundamental
element to attention. Eni defined its own Grievance Mechanism (GM) to receive, recognise, classify,
investigate, respond and resolve claims and complaints in a timely, planned and respectful manner.
Eni’s GM, defined in 2014, is based on the international Guidelines on the matter, published by IPIECA,
and it has been active in all affiliates since 2016. Grievances are monitored through a dedicated
system called “Stakeholder Management System - SMS” (for more information, please see p. 17). A
claim mechanism at the operational level allows to respond rapidly and effectively to possible crit-
ical situations, preventing their deterioration and the araisin of conflicts. In 2019, Eni received 253
claims from 8 aftiliates/districts/plants, of which 44%, i.e. 112 cases, were resolved and closed. Most
grievances came from Sub-Saharan Africa (Congo, Ghana, Nigeria) and involved mainly: access to
energy, employment development, education, land management.

ENI’S GRIEVANCE MANAGEMENT IN GHANA

Listening to stakeholders and their needs is of fundamental importance to better contribute to cre-
ate shared value with the host population.

In Ghana, Eni has constant relations with 79 local stakeholders. A responsible grievance manage-
ment entails the need to introduce a new assessment approach and methods to accommodate
different local contexts in which Eni operates, to ensure the best possible resolution of the critical
issues raised. In May 2019, for example, one of the breeders who benefited from the “livelihood
restoration programme initiative” complained that the breeding business did not allow to generate
sufficient profits to purchase all of the animal feed and continue the activity and requested the
company to supply additional feed. Eni sent experts to identify the reasons for the low yields of
the breeder’s activity. The solution of problems with hygiene and sanitation and with transport-
ing products and feed allowed to successfully solve the problems of this micro enterprise: these
methods were also shared among the local breeders’ association, to improve their knowledge of
the best management practices.
