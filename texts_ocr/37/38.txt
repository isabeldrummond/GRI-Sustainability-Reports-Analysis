for integrated water management at the local level will be launched. In terms of transparency, in 2019 Eni

publicly responded to the CDP Water Security questionnaire, achieving an A- score and being recognised

as a leader in water management. This result is above the industry average score of B.

PORTO TORRES AND WATER VALORISATION
Eni’s strategy for the recovery and valorization of natural resources is also implemented through
efficient water management. The environmental company Eni Rewind is active in water treatment
through 43 plants in Italy, with a total capacity of 31 million m?/year, promoting water reutilization
for industrial purposes. In 2019, 5.1 million m? of treated waters have been destined mainly to reuse.
The water treatment plants are aligned to the best available technologies and are subject to strict
monitoring plans that guarantee full compliance with the quality of water discharges and emissions
in the atmosphere, widely within the authorization limits required by law. For example at the Porto
Torres site, a 10 km barrier was built to reclaim the groundwater, with 103 wells to extract the water
that is then treated in 5 plants with a total capacity of 340 m3/hour (2.5 mln m?/year). A portion of it,
i.e. 750,000 m?in 2019, is subsequently sent to reverse osmosis for the production of demineralised
water and then reused in Versalis plants, thus valorising the resource and reducing its extraction in
nature. The e-hyrec technology, patented by Eni Rewind, is also applied in Porto Torres. The auto-
matic device, located inside the wells, allows selective separation of the aqueous water from the oily
water, recovering only the hydrocarbon portion without extracting water — while traditional systems
withdraw a preponderant part of water (approximately 70-80%) — with the consequent improvement
in terms of effectiveness and efficiency of the groundwater reclaiming operation.
