Management role at the central and local level

In Eni, sustainability cuts across all corporate processes, but also all functions. To ensure that sustainability
matters are managed from the corporate leadership of all Eni’s companies worldwide, Eni has adopted a busi-
ness support organisation cutting across all areas (Chief Services & Stakeholder Relations Officer - CSRO) and
responsible for defining the guidelines, methods and tools for managing and promoting sustainability matters,
through ever closer integration with operating processes. The sustainability structure has been active since
2006 and renamed Impresso since 2015: it is a central organisational function (within the CSRO structure)
that coordinates and supervises sustainability-related activities, from monitoring the evolution of the external
environment to defining sustainability targets for the Strategic Plan and to developing initiatives in favour of
the Countries where Eni operates. The integration of sustainability in the business is ensured at the central
level by the collaboration between the sustainability function and the different functions (staff and business)
that oversee sustainability matters. At the local branches, Managing Directors (top level managers of the
corporate structure in the Countries where Eni is active], supported both by the local sustainability contact
persons and by the central sustainability function, are responsible for defining the development plans of the
Countries according to local needs. In 2019, a central organisational function was established, which is called
Scenarios, Positioning and Medium-long term Plan. Reporting directly to the CFO, it supervises the preparation
and consolidation of the medium-long term plan and ensured the drafting of the configuration assumptions for
the portfolio of energy sources for the achievement of the targets in the Plan, including ESG targets.
