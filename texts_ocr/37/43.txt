WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO ENI?

Respect for human rights is an integral part of Eni's culture, based on the dignity of every human being and on
company's responsibility to contribute to the well-being of individuals and of local communities. The constant effort
to assure respect for human rights is based on a due diligence process in line with the United Nations Guiding Prin-
ciples on Business and Human Rights, guaranteeing access to remedial measures even in case of impacts deriving
from the activities of its own affiliates. This approach, a prerequisite for a just energy transition, is rooted in Eni's
business model and it is guided by the Top Management, which diffuses it in the corporate culture. The effort starts
from relations with employees and extends to those with local communities, governments, suppliers and commer-
cial partners, as well as to security activities and workers’ rights. This effort is also confirmed by the adoption of the
10 principles of the Global Compact and by the recognition among the Lead companies of the initiative.
