Eni is an integrated energy company looking at the long-term, aiming to play a decisive role in the energy transition to a low carbon future,
maximizing the energy efficiency of its assets and total elimination of flaring and methane leaks, the growth of low carbon sources in its
portfolio; zero-emission sources development and the development of circular economy initiatives.

The circular transformation of Eni has been started-up in the downstream businesses, with the first conversion in the world of a traditional
refinery into biorefinery, the transformation of waste in energy products, leveraging on proprietary technologies such as the Waste To Fuel
and on the implementation in the chemical business of new processes and products transforming waste plastics in second raw materi-
al. Consolidated skills, technologies, innovation, research and geographical differentiation of assets are the levers to strengthen a change
based on the synergies among stakeholders, the industrial symbiosis and the cultural change.
