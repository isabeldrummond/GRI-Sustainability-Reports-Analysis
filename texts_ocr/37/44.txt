ENI IN THE CORPORATE HUMAN RIGHTS BENCHMARK ASSESSMENT (CHRB)
In November 2019, the results of the third edition of the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB)
were published. Eni took eighth place among the 200 companies analysed from different sectors
and it is among the companies that most improved their score since the first edition in 2017. The
total score improved in all six analysed categories and it was the best performer in the section
called “Company Human Rights Practices”, which assesses the factors and processes for respect
for rights and prevention and attenuation of risks and impacts on human rights. The significant im-
provement in Eni’s performance, assessed by the CHRB, reflects the continuous progress the com-
pany is making in the approach to human rights integrated in the business, started over ten years
ago and considerably increased in the last four years.
