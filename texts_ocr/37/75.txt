for limited assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and apply procedures in order
to obtain limited assurance that the Report is free of material misstatement.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in scope than those performed
in a reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised (“reasonable assurance
engagement”) and, therefore, do not provide us with a sufficient level of assurance that we have
become aware of all significant facts and circumstances that might be identified in a reasonable
assurance engagement.

The procedures performed on the Report were based on our professional judgement and consisted in
interviews, primarily with company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information
presented in the Report, analysis of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to
obtain evidence considered useful.

In particular, we performed the following procedures:

1) analysing of the reasons for the coexistence of the NFS (consolidated Non-Financial Statement
required under Articles 3, 4 and 7 of Legislative Decree 254/2016) and the Report and the profiles
that differentiate the two documents;

2) analysing the process aimed at defining the significant reporting areas to be disclosed in the
Report, with regard to the methods for their identification, in terms of priority for the various
stakeholders, as well as the internal validation of the process findings;

3) comparing the financial information reported in the Report with the information included in the
Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements;

4) understanding of the processes underlying the preparation, collection and management of the
significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the Report.

In particular, we held meetings and interviews with the management of Eni SpA and with the
personnel of Eni Pakistan Ltd, Versalis SpA, Eni Muara Bakau BV, Agiba Petroleum Co., Eni
Angola SpA and Société de Service du Gazoduc Transtunisien SA and we performed limited
analysis of documentary evidence, to gather information about the processes and procedures for
the collection, consolidation, processing and submission of the non-financial information to the
function responsible for the preparation of the Report.

Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group:
- at parent company level,

a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the Report, we carried out interviews
and acquired supporting documentation to verify their consistency with available evidence;

b) with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical procedures as well as
limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the accuracy of consolidation of the
information.
