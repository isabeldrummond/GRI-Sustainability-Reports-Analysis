ENIFOR 2019 3 i

It is necessary to consider that the achievement of the SDGs requires an unprecedented collaboration between the public and the private sec-
tor. Hence Eni’s effort in defining and building alliances (public-private partnerships) with locally rooted, internationally recognised partners.
Moreover, Eni has been confirmed as a participant in the Global Compact LEAD — the largest initiative in the world on business sustainabil-
ity — demonstrating its ongoing commitment in favour of the Principles of the United Nations for Responsible Business. Eni was recognised
as one of the most active companies: in 2019, it participated in the Action Platform for Reporting on the SDGs and in the Action Platform for
Financial Innovation for the SDGs.
