Energy demand will have to be met, limiting atmospheric emissions of climate-altering gases to
combat climate change. The ongoing global warming phenomenon is estimated to have reached
a level of approximately 1 °C over the pre-industrial era. Currently, approximately 2/3 of global
greenhouse gas emissions originate from the energy sector; of these, approximately 55% is related
to the combustion of oil and gas, with coal covering the remainder. According to the IEA, a trajecto-
ry compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement requires halving the emissions of the energy
sector by 2040, to reach a value of approximately 1/3 of the current one in 2050 and ultimately
zeroing net emissions in 2070.

Health emergency connected with COVID-19
The beginning of 2020 was marked by the worldwide spread of the health crisis tied to COVID-19, which trig-
gered a series of containment measures, such as shutting down production activities and social distancing,

with severe negative impacts on the economic environment and consequently on energy demand.

The magnitude of the effects will be closely tied to the duration of the lockdown and to the impact of the un-
precedented economic measures taken by Governments throughout the world.

Though the energy sector needs to address the challenges connected with declining consumption, decrea-
sing commodity prices and with the weakening of the general context in which it operates, it will have to en-
sure continuity to its highly strategic business, while providing the highest safety standards, and ensure the
fulfillment of its decarbonization commitments, seizing the opportunities arising from the energy transition.
