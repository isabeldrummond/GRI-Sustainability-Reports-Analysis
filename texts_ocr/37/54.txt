ENI FOR 2019

Sustainability throughout all business phases
From the time licenses are acquired, through to the exploration and the development of business projects, from
production to decommissioning, instruments and methodologies have been adopted that are consistent with
the main international standards, ensuring a more efficient and systematic approach to decision-making, in
order to contribute to the development of the host Countries. The analysis of the socio-economic context, that
accompanies in an ever deeper manner the business design stages, allows Eni to understand local needs and
hence to define the priority sectors of intervention. These priorities translate into objectives in the four-year
strategic Plan, aimed at directly or indirectly contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. This is obtained
through analytical and managerial instruments that cover the entire cycle of the business and allow:

1. the knowledge of the Country context from the socio-economic, environmental and cultural viewpoint, with
the use of internationally recognised tools like the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI);

2. the relationship with local stakeholders directly and/or indirectly involved to understand their requests, and
any grievances, to strengthen mutual trust (see p. 63);

3. the assessment and mitigation of the potential impacts of the activities to identify critical issues, opportu-
nities, risks from the socio-economic and environmental standpoint, including respect for and promotion of
human rights;

4. the definition and implementation of Local Development Programmes consistent with the Country Develop-
ment Plans, the 2030 Agenda and the Nationally Determined Contributions (see pp. 61-69);

5. the assessment and measurment of local development generated “learn and adapt”) through the use of
instruments and methodologies recognised internationally and adopted by Eni, such as the logical frame-
work approach and management of the project cycle, as well as tools developed by Eni in collaboration with
academic institutions such as the Eni lmpact Tool and the Eni Local Content Evaluation Model (see pp. 70-73).

This approach is based on collaborations with institutions, cooperation agencies and local stakeholders to iden-

tify the interventions necessary to meet communities’ needs in line with the National Development Plans and

the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations.

MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX (MPI)
The Global MPI is an internationally recognized measure of acute multidimensional poverty, available for over
100 Countries. The Global MPI examines the deprivation conditions of a person through 10 indicators across
three dimensions: education, health and living standards. The index allows to compare the incidence and inten-
sity of poverty between Countries but also within individual States, as disaggregated data are also available at
the local level, as well as for urban and rural areas. The Global MPI, therefore, is a significant reference also to
measure progress relative to the 1° goal of the 2030 Agenda. According to the “Global Multidimensional Poverty
Index 2019”, 23.1% of the population covered by the global MPI 2019 — 1.3 billion people — are multimensionally
poor. The Global MPI is becoming an increasingly authoritative international reference methodology. The global
MPI was included in the Human Development Report (HDR) in 2010 and has been published in the HDR and
by OPHI ever since. The Global Sustainable Development Report of the United Nations encourages governments
to use this multidimensional index in the development, implementation and control stages of its own policies
against poverty and for social inclusion.

Use of the Multidimensional Poverty Index in Eni

Eni carries out poverty analyses both before starting its operations in a Country, and to improve its own under-
standing of the socio-economic context of the Countries where it is present. The Global MPI is one of the instru-
ments used by Eni to ensure that its action is as effective as possible and directed at the most vulnerable people.
