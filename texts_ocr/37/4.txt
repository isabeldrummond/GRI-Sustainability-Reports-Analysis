Message to our Stakeholders

Committed in the present to build the future

The historical moment we are witnessing poses unprecedented challenges and very complex scenarios on our path. The dramatic health
emergency caused by the new coronavirus finds us on the frontline — and in close contact with those who are coordinating the interventions
— to protect the health of our people and of the communities where we operate. Italy has been the first western Country to experience the
threat of the virus and our response to the emergency was immediate. We launched several initiatives to support healthcare facilities in Italy
and in the Countries where we operate, making the most of the experiences gained in health and social fields at a global level.

This is not the first crisis we face: our company was founded after the Second World War, to contribute to the reconstruction of a de-
stroyed Country, and it emerged stronger from the crises that hit the sector over the years. It is important to remember who we are and
where we come from, remembering what we have gone through during the years that has now become method and best practice. This is
why | care so much about our sustainability report, which collects, year by year, the fruits of our commitment for the development of the
people who work with us and who live in the Countries of presence.

Eni stays strong. The commitments we have made to continue our transformation process — which made us a simpler, faster and more
resilient integrated energy company — remain intact, as our determination to fight climate change and our efforts towards a just energy
transition. As we announced with our Long-Term Strategic Plan to 2050, we want to be leaders in supplying decarbonized energy prod-
ucts, by combining economic and environmental sustainability. We will continue to study, improve and deploy at an industrial scale our
ideas and innovative technologies. We want a future where everyone can access energy resources, in an efficient and sustainable way,
focusing on the skills and innovation capacities of a company that represents the Italian excellence around the world. An example of this
is our HPCS — the world’s most powerful industrial supercomputer — which allows us to shape what is not visible: from the subsurface,
developing and running advanced geoscience algorithms, to new energy sources, supporting the development of new technological solu-
tions like wave power and magnetic fusion. In this context, thanks to a European project, we have proudly made HPC5 available to model
the effect of an array of drugs on the Covid-19 strain.

Crises and emergencies are dramatic moments, but they are also an opportunity: the comfort zone in which we lived until now is crum-
bling and we find ourselves reflecting on our values, on the importance of what we do in our life and work. Businesses are organizations
of economic, financial and technical resources, but they are human communities above all. Today, we notice that by putting our values
as a priority, we contribute to fill a void. Today, we clearly see the reason why we chose to inspire our new mission to the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals: they aim to bring real and sustainable growth that takes into consideration the environment, as well as the needs of
mankind and the values on which business must be built. This point of view is what makes our ambitions credible.

We often talk about long-term vision, circular economy, about the need to find a new development model fit for human beings. Never
before has it been possible to experience how solidarity among people and communities — and not mere profit — is the key to guarantee
a future for the next generations. This is why we chose to dedicate the Eni for 2019 edition to the just transition, to our commitment to
promote a fair evolution that takes into account all the factors at stake: from the need to reduce our carbon footprint in the direction of the
Paris Agreement to the need for a global development of mankind. A commitment which — once again — we want to carry on in synergy
with all those who share this vision. We are pleased to have undertaken important partnerships with international multilateral organiza-
tions such as UNIDO, UNDP, FAO and the World Bank, to have collaborated with UNESCO on the first Biennale of Luanda for peace, in Angola,
and for the joint work with civil society organizations, institutes and research centers. Only together can we change and improve.

At the heart of our actions is the ongoing commitment to respect human rights, essential prerequisite for the safeguard of the dignity of
each person. To work at our best, we need to make sure we do so transparently, paying attention to business integrity, the environment
and social inclusion, and seizing opportunities by looking further ahead. We have clear international references that help us in this direc-
tion: above all, within the United Nations, in addition to the SDGs, the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and the
10 principles of the Global Compact.

The waters of the sea we are sailing are certainly rough. But on this ship we are not alone. The health emergency, as safety at work,
economic tensions and geopolitical uncertainties affect us all. Now we can see the added value of acting together, of focusing on the
person and on the basic needs of the people we work with and who live in the Countries that host us, values that we want to promote with
perseverance and determination.
