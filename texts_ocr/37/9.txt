Business model

Eni’s business model is focused on creating value for its stakeholders and shareholders through a strong presence along the whole
value chain. Eni, as an integrated energy company, contributes, directly or indirectly, to achieve Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) of the UN 2030 Agenda, supporting a socially fair energy transition responding through concrete, quick and economically
sustainable answers to the challenge of combating climate change and giving access to energy resources in an efficient and sus-
tainable way, for all. To manage this effectively, Eni integrates organically its industrial plan with the principles of environmental and
social sustainability, enlarging its actions along three directives: 1. operational excellence; 2. carbon neutrality in the long term;

Firstly, Eni’s business is constantly focused on the operational excellence. This is translated into: a continuous commitment to the valo-
rization of people and, in HSE, to the safeguard of health and safety and environmental protection; the efficiency and resilience of opera-
tions, thanks to which Eni has accelerated projects’ time-to-market, reducing their break-even; a Solid financial discipline; the maximum
attention to the integrity and respect for human rights. The company will leverage on these drivers to catch the opportunities deriving
from the possible evolution of the energy market and technological progress and to grow organically;

. Secondly, Eni’s business model envisages a path to decarbonization with the ambition to lead the company to become carbon neutral in

the long term. In this context, the company adopts a life cycle GHG emissions approach and leverages on a set of actions including:
maximizing the energy efficiency of its assets; growing low carbon sources in its portfolio (with an increase in gas and biofuel share, as
well as the production and marketing of biomethane); growing emission-free sources and developing circular economy initiatives. An
important role will also be played by the application of new technologies capturing CO, and the development of forestry projects for forest
conservation in accordance with the REDD+ scheme. This approach and these drivers will enable Eni to considerably reduce its carbon
footprint, both in terms of net emissions and carbon intensity;

. Thirdly, Eni’s value creation will leverage on the alliances for the promotion of local development in its Countries of operation. Eni is not

only committed to address the valorization of resources of producing Countries, allocating their gas production to the local market and
facilitating access to electricity, but also to promote a wide range of community initiatives: from diversification of local economies, to he-
alth projects, education, access to water and hygiene projects. This distinctive approach, called Dual Flag, is based on collaborations with
institutions, cooperation agencies and local stakeholders in order to identify certain necessary actions to meet the needs of communities
in line with the National Development Plans and the 2030 UN Agenda. Eni is also committed to creating employment opportunities and
transferring its know-how and expertise to its local partners involved in operations. These distinctive factors are reflected in the Local
Development Programmes (LDP) to foster an inclusive growth, creating long-term value. Initiatives identified in Eni’s Countries of opera-
tions leverage on an integrated approach through public-private partnerships and alliances with other internationally recognised players
engaged in the territory.

Eni’s business model is designed on these three levers leveraging on internal competencies, the deployment of innovative technologies
and the digitalization process.
