OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE MODEL

Human rights salient issues

In 2019, moreover, the actions of the multi-year plan implemented by a Working Group launched in 201?
were completed; it identifies the main areas of improvement and the actions to be implemented, as-
sociated with the 4 macro areas into which are grouped the “Salient Issues*” of Eni: human rights (i)
on the workplace; (ii) in the communities; (iii) in the supply chain; (iv) in security operations. These

actions were incorporated in specific managerial objectives directly connected with human rights per-
formance, assigned to all 18 personnel directly reporting to the CEO and to over 50 second-level sub-
ordinates of the CEO and executives (please refer to Eni for Human Rights for additional information).

Human rights training activities

Eni considers the training and awareness activities dedicated to its own employees and partners a
key element of its own commitment in respect for human rights. In continuity with the awareness
path started back in 2016, in 2019 human rights training continued to be administered to 97% of
employees, to create a shared culture, a common language, and to improve the understanding of
possible impacts of the business on human rights. In 2019, the human rights training program
continued both with specific modules and with campaigns accessible via web by all employees
(Security and Human Rights, Human Rights and relations with Communities, Human Rights in the
Workplace and Human rights in the Supply Chain). Moreover, in 2019 the new training campaigns
were started for the entire Eni population: “Sustainability in terms of stakeholders, reporting and
human rights” and “SDGs”.

Human rights in the workplace: industrial relations

Respecting the rights of the people who work within Eni and for Eni is essential to build mutually
satisfactory and durable relations. Eni’s Industrial Relations model is based on agreements that
define the procedures for sharing information with the organisations representing the workers.
These agreements were defined at the national and international level and among them two are
European (the European Works Council and the European Observatory for Health, Safety and Envi-
ronment in Eni} and one is global: the Global Framework Agreement (GFA), renewed in June 2019
at the end of the annual meeting held in Athens. This document, resulting from a collaboration with
the main Italian unions and with IndustriALL Global Union, encloses a series of commitments to
comply with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with the Declaration on the elimination of
all forms of discrimination against women, with the Declaration of the rights of the child, with the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other ILO Conventions directly applicable
to Eni’s activities, to OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, with the principles of the Glob-
al Compact of the United Nations, with the ILO Declaration on Multinational Enterprises revised
in 201? and with UNGPs. By this renewed four-year agreement, Eni and the general secretaries

13) Salient issues identify the main matters identified in Eni with respect to human rights.
