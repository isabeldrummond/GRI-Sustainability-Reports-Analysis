 

Urban solid waste production
(billion tonnes)

In 2016, the production of urban solid waste on a global scale reached 2.01 billion tonnes. In Sub-Saharan African Countries, the daily
production of waste per capita can drop even below 0.1 kg, while it reaches an average of 2.2 kg in OECD Countries which, overall, are
responsible for 44% of production of waste globally. The trend of increasing waste globally is also related to the increase in population and
growing urbanization, so it is estimated that the annual production of waste can increase by 70% in 2050 compared to 2016, reaching 3.40
billion tonnes.

Since 2011, when the United Nations published its "Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights", regulations and other
initiatives on the issue have proliferated at international level. At international level, particularly at European level, there is also a
constant and growing attention towards the introduction of regulatory provisions that provide for reporting obligations and the
conduct of due diligence on human rights by businesses.
