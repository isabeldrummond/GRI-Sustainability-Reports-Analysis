advanced stage of completion, will further increase the available capacity of over 300 MW, thus placing
Okpai in first place for capacity among power generation plants built by private operators in Nigeria. Also
in Nigeria, since 2012, Eni through the Ob-Ob plant has supplied gas to third parties who, with a plant hav-
ing an installed capacity of 150 MW, generate electricity for approximately 1 million beneficiaries.

Off-grid energy access projects

With the Promoting Energy Efficiency and Clean Cooking project, Eni in Mozambique contributes to the
replacement, among vulnerable families, of 10,000 traditional stoves with the improved ones provided
in the Plan, reducing deforestation caused by cutting wood used for the production of charcoal for do-
mestic use. This project promotes a sustainable local production, creating jobs and new local entrepre-
neurship. Moreover, in 2020 Eni and the World Bank signed a memorandum of understanding in Ghana
for the development of initiatives to promote the use of improved, more efficient wood-burning stoves,
to reduce exposure to toxic wood fumes and prevent forest exploitation.

THE THIRD TURBINE FOR THE CENTRALE ELECTRIQUE DU CONGO (CEC)
Following the acquisition, in 2007, of the M’Boundi onshore reservoir in Congo, Eni has developed in
the Country an energy access model on a large scale. The “Projet intégré” (Integrated Project] was
launched with the construction of the Centrale Electrique du Djéno (CED) and the Centrale Electrique
du Congo (CEC) power stations, the requalification of the energy transport infrastructure and the
expansion of the electricity distribution network to the city of Pointe-Noire. CEC and CED are fueled
with gas from the M’Boundi and Marine XII reservoirs, contributing to the reduction of emissions
from gas flaring. The CEC plant, commenced in 2010, is part of Eni’s broader strategy to expand ac-
cess to energy in the Country and promote the development of the local energy resources. With the
commissioning of a third gas turbine in February 2020 (providing additional capacity of 170 MW for
a total of 484 MW], the CEC contributes approximately to 60/70% of the total electricity generation
in the Country. In addition, the CEC supplies electricity to the city of Pointe-Noire also through the in-
stallation of over 6,500 street lighting points, benefiting approximately 350,000 people. The energy
access program also allowed the success of the Hinda Project, supplying electricity to 33 community
structures powered with solar panels (11 medical centres and 22 drinking water wells).
