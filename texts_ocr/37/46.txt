ENI FOR 2019

of the signatory unions confirmed their joint commitment to promote sustainable development
and sensitise direct and indirect employees on respect for human and labour rights. The Athens
meeting also provided an important opportunity to exchange opinions and delve further into the
different issues presented by the Unions and the workers’ representatives in the Countries where
Eni is active.

Human rights and security

Eni manages its own Security operations in compliance with international human rights principles
and with the Voluntary Principles on Security & Human Rights. In line with its commitment, Eni has
designed a coherent system of rules and instruments to assure that:

* contractual terms comprise provisions on respect for human rights;

* security force providers are selected, among others, on the basis of human rights criteria;

* security operators and supervisors receive adequate training on respect for human rights;

* events considered most at risk are managed according to international standards.

Moreover, Eni is developing a “human rights due diligence” process directed at identifying the risk of
negative impact on human rights in relation to security activities and consider the use of preventive
and/or mitigating measures. In 2019, the e-learning course “Security & Human Rights”, addressed to
the Security professional family, was addressed both to newly hired personnel and to resources who
had not yet taken part before. The e-learning course has been produced in three languages (Italian,
English and French) to extend its accessibility. The issue of Human Rights & Security is regularly
addressed in all workshops dedicated to newly appointed Security Ofticers, which in 2019 reached
their third edition.

TRAINING AND INFORMATION PROGRAM ON SECURITY & HUMAN RIGHTS
On July 9 and 10, 2019, training seminars on Security and respect for human rights were carried out in
Pakistan over three sessions: one addressed to Eni Pakistan managers, to managers of the companies

that provide security services and to the private security operators performing their activities at this
site and two sessions addressed to the private security operators who perform their activities at the
operating site. In addition to the courses in Pakistan, from October 14 to 18, 2019, the second edition of
the “Security & Human Rights” course was carried out in Nigeria for the Security Forces operating at the
Eni sites of Abuja and Port Harcourt. The initiatives in Pakistan and Nigeria are included in the broader
training project started in 2009 to promote corporate best practices, which integrate the international
standards established by the “United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights” (UN-
GPs) and by the “Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights” (VPSHR), thus concretely realis-
ing Eni’s commitment on respect for human rights. Confirming Eni’s commitment to safeguard people's
safety, respect for local communities and constant dialogue with the Authorities and with local security
operators, from 2009 to the present, training sessions were carried out in Italy (Rome and San Donato
Milanese in 2009), in Egypt and Nigeria (2010), in Pakistan and Iraq (2011), in the Republic of the Congo
and in Angola (2012), in Indonesia and Algeria (2013), in Mozambique (2014) and Kenya (2015), in
Venezuela and Ecuador (2016), in Nigeria (2017) and Tunisia (2018).
