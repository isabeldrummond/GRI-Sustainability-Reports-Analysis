ENI FOR 2019

Local development project in Italy

Most of Eni’s local development initiatives in Italy derived, in 2019, from Memorandums of Under-
standing with national/local agencies. Regarding access to energy, the Municipality of Ravenna
carried out energy requalification work on public buildings, while in Val d’Agri more than €1 million
was provided to the Municipalities of the valley to supply natural gas and perform energy efficien-
cy-boosting works. Several economic diversification projects were implemented, both to promote
innovation and local capabilities (e.g. the CoLABoRA incubator in Ravenna) and to boost local tour-
ism. With Coldiretti Basilicata, the first implementing agreement in Italy was signed to promote the
regional agri-food sector and in Sicily, an agreement was signed with the Sicilian Fondazione Banco
Alimentare to reduce the social vulnerability of the Gela area, acting on the problem of access to food.
In the field of education, the Eighth Agreement with the Municipality of Ravenna allowed to carry out
educational activities on environmental and energy-related topics and to promote the activation of
internships. In Basilicata, €750,000 were allocated to implement the activities of the local branch of
Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei. Regarding environmental protection, work was carried out for the pres-
ervation of the Ravenna coastline and coastal natural habitats, while in Basilicata the management
of an environmental monitoring network and the implementation of the “Segni e Percorsi” (Signs and
Routes) program were funded.

AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTATION AND EDUCATION CENTRE PROJECT

The project consists of the construction of an “Agricultural Experimentation and Education Centre” that will
become a hub to attract and develop talents, to promote economic activities and innovation, to stimulate
development in the agri-food sector. This Centre is meant to be a development lever for the Basilicata re-
gion. The project is intended to be a crossroads between production system, education and research and
it aims to establish closer synergies among the different systems, promoting technological transfer and
innovations (process, product, management, organisational, supply chain) effectively, rapidly and gener-
ating a positive impact on business competitiveness.

Contents of the project

The project, carried out on the lands adjacent to the Cova on a surface area of approximately 25 hectares,
comprises the following main activities: (i) agricultural experimentation, with technologically innovative
and experimental processes on different crops; (ii) provision of technical assistance to the region's agri-
food enterprises; (ii) administration of training and professionalising activities for farmers; (iv) informa-
tional events for the local public; (v) development of farming innovation projects, in partnership with the
local players, using specific funds.

The project, fully funded by Eni with a commitment of approximately €3.5 million in the 2019-2023 time
frame, is expected to generate a cumulative employment impact (direct and indirect) of over 100 peo-
ple and a cumulative economic impact of over €? million on connected businesses. The CO, absorption
generated by the project is calculated to be approximately 50 tonnes per year.
