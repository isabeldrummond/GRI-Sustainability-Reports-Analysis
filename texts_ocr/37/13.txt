Eni’s new mission and the
Sustainable Development Goals

Eni’s new mission — approved by the Board of Directors in September 2019 — expressly represents the transformation path taken by the
company to play a defining role in the global “just transition” process towards a low carbon future, promoting access to energy efficiently
and sustainably for everyone. This mission completes and strengthens the previous one, confirming Eni’s commitment to an energy transi-
tion that is also socially fair and organically integrating the 1? SDGs to which Eni intends to contribute, exploiting new business opportunities.
This is possible thanks to Eni’s people, their passion and the companys drive towards continuous innovation, to valuing diversity as a lever-

age for development, to the respect and promotion of human rights, to integrity in business management and to environmental protection.
