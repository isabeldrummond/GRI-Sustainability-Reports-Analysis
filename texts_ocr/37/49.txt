WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO ENI?

To improve the governance and transparency of the extraction sector, it is essential to promote a good use of
resources and to prevent corruption phenomena. Repudiating of corruption has been one of the fundamental
ethical principles of Eni's Code of Ethics since 1998 and for this reason Eni adopted a comprehensive system
of rules and controls for the prevention of corruption offences (the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program).
