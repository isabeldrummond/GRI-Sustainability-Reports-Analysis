WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO ENI?

Facilitating access to electricity while promoting initiatives in favour of communities - from economic diver-
sification to projects for health, education, access to water and sanitation - is Eni's distinctive approach to
host Countries, known as “Dual Flag" since Enrico Mattei's time. This approach identifies sustainability for Eni
at the local level, which translates into the will to contribute to the development of the Countries where Eni
is present with new business perspectives, but also supporting the primary needs of local populations. This
is possible thanks to the definition of specific Local Development Programmes (LDP) that follow the direction
traced by the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations and by the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),
signed by each Country in the context of the Paris Agreement.

MoUs were signed The development of domestic markets, supported by important infrastructure investments, also acti-
with Angola and vates a value chain through the creation of new business opportunities and the transfer of competen-
Mozambique, cies and know-how to local partners and employees, and to the communities of the Countries where
which couple the Eni is present. Eni’s contribution to development is integrated in all business activities, starting from
traditional business the knowledge of the operating context: anticipating and understanding any environmental and social
with the commitment impacts, Eni is able to define an action strategy that leads to the creation of value for the company and
for diversified, for the host Country. In this context, in 2019 Eni signed two Memorandums of Understanding (MoU)
sustainable growth with the Governments of Mozambique and Angola, in the area of the Province of Cabinda, which couple

traditional business with the commitment to the Countries’ diversified, sustainable growth. The are-
as of cooperation include access to energy, economic diversification, the development of renewable
energies, protection and expansion of forests, access to water and to public health services and to
education. These are integrated development programs (Local Development Programme, LDP), de-
signed considering the National Development Plans and the Nationally Determined Contributions to
contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda.
