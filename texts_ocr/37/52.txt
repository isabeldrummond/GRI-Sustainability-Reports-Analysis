The Global Multidimensional Poverty
Index (MPI) is an international tool that
measures progress compared to SDG 1
and compares acute multidimensional
poverty for over 100 Countries and 5.7
billion people, relating to three
dimensions: education, health and
standards of living. The Global MPI, whose
value is between O (absence of
multidimensional poverty) and 1
(maximum multidimensional poverty), is
calculated by multiplying the incidence
by the intensity of poverty.

2040, A RESTOF THE WORLD

In 2018, 2.6 billion people still do not have access to clean cooking and resort to the use of solid biomass for domestic use with harmful effects on health.
Where the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) scenario aims to have full access to clean cooking as early as 2030, in the Stated Policies Scenario
(STEPS) by 2040 1.8 billion people will still have no access to clean cooking. Today 1/3 of the world's population without access to clean cooking is
concentrated in Africa. By 2040, failure to access clean cooking will continue to be prevalent mainly in Africa (approximately 47% of people without access).

Other challenges for sustainable development

The UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, presented in New York in September 2015, identifies 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
which represent common goals for the current complex challenges and are an important reference for the international community. Although
important progress has been made worldwide in helping to achieve SDGs, major challenges still remain.
