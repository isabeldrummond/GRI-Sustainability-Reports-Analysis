"The Logical Framework
has the power to
communicate clearly and
succinctly the essential
elements of a complex
project throughouth the
project's life cycle"

World Bank, 2000

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE

Creating sustainable jobs
for young people and
women in modern
agriculture

Increased income of small
producers and agricultural
cooperatives in the long term

Promoting training,
research and innovation

Logical Framework Approach and monitoring, evaluation and learning system
Similarly to the practice in the business activities, in local development projects, when possible, Eni adopts
project management tools in line with international standards. In 2019, to enhance the effectiveness and
efticiency of local development projects, Eni developed its own monitoring tool, tested in Congo, Ghana and
Mozambique, based on the Logical Framework of the project. This method, also known as Result Based
Management Approach, is able to support all phases of the project which is oriented towards measura-
ble objectives and impacts through the identification of specific indicators. This approach is summarised
through a schematic representation (Logical Frame Matrix) of the project's strategy that shows the causal
relation of the actions to be developed (activities and inputs) and the effects produced by it (outcome,
impact). A proper monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) system allows to manage the project with
a view to continuous improvement and allows to identify lessons learned and/or recommendations for
future projects.

Application of the monitoring tool in Catrep project in Congo

The MEL tool was applied in the testing phase to the Catrep 2 agricultural project (Centre d’Appui Technique
et de Ressources Professionnelles — phase 2) in the Congo, whose general objective is to promote food
and nutritional security and the economic growth and diversification of the area, contributing to the SDGs
1, 2,5, 8and 1? Some indicators referred to 3 specific objectives of the project for 2019 are provided below.

(a) The project, which had an initial phase from May to December 2012, was expected to be concluded in Novernber 2019 with phase two but was extended to December 2020
(b) The 2019 result deviates from the expected estimate, as varieties of cultures with better yields were preferred, during the project, although with lower production in terms of kg produced, such as basil, rocket salad,
compared to the estimated production of cassava root.
