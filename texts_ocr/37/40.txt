ENI FOR 2019

Circular economy and waste

The path to transition towards a circular economy is a response to current environmental challenges, replac-
ing the classic linear economy model with a regenerative approach based on synergy and industrial symbio-
sis and associated with a version, through ecodesign, of the production processes and of asset management.
This process unfolds by reducing the extraction of natural resources in favour of materials from renewable
sources (or originating from the scraps from production processes), reducing and give value to scrap (waste,
emissions, discharges) through recycling or recovery actions, and extending the useful life of products and
assets with reuse or reconversion actions. In 2019, Eni designated certification third party Certiquality, which
took advantage of cooperation with Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna di Pisa, for the development and validation of
a quali-quantitative assessment model of the circularity of the operational site. Moreover, since 201? Eni has
been carrying out site-specific circularity analyses to map circularity elements already present and identify
possible improvement actions, and 4 of them were carried out in 2019 at company sites.

Virtuous actions identified through circularity analyses

  
  

BRINDIS! MULTI-COMPANY SITE

Design work is ongoing on a floating
photovoltaic power station; in addition,
water from TAF") is expected to be used
at the new membrane system for the
production of demineralised water, which
will allow an additional reduction of the
seawater used so far.

BOLGIANO OFFICES

Energy saving technologies such as Smart
Windows and Organic Solar Panels are used at
these offices.

TARANTO REFINERY

Opportunity to optimize the Water Reuse
plant to further reduce the extraction of well
water and the sea discharge of process water
and to send the sludge separated with waste
water treatment to be recovered rather than
disposed of.

RHO STORAGE FACILITY

Possibility of collecting rain water for
reutilization in the fire-fighting line, thus
replacing ground water extracted from a well.

WASTE-TO-FUEL: NEW LIFE FOR WASTE
Eni developed the Waste to Fuel (W2F) proprietary technology for the transformation of the OFMSW (Or-
ganic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste) into bio-oil (up to 16% of the incoming charge) with recovery of
the water contained in the wet waste (between 60 and 80%). Bio-oil can be destined to sea transporta-
tion, given the low sulphur content, or it can contribute to produce advanced biofuels and the recovered
water can be destined to industrial uses. Eni Rewind is active in the development of plants, starting
from the pilot plant operating in the area of the Gela Refinery which, in 2019, provide the necessary
elements to apply the technology on an industrial scale. As provided in the MoU signed by Eni and Cas-
sa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) on March 12, 2019, Eni Rewind in a joint venture with CDP will develop and
operate the industrial plants in Italy. The first project is in Porto Marghera in collaboration with Veritas,
multiutility in Venice, as per the Memorandum of Understanding (March 2019). The plant, to be built ina
reclaimed area, will have a treatment capacity of up to 150 thousand tonnes per year.

The Waste to Fuel
technology meets the
requirements of circular
economy, because it
reduces the use of raw
materials in energy
generation and reuses

urban society's waste
