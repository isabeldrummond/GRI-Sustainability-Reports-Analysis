In 2019, the total recordable injury rate (TRIR) of the workforce
improved by 3% vs. 2018, with marked improvement for the
employees (-44%], but a deterioration for contractors due to the
increase in the number of incidents (95 vs. 82 in 2018).

Safety culture

Eni is working hard on constantly spreading a safety culture as an essential part of the activities,
through projects that promote safety behaviours in all work and, in general, life environments. The goal
is to motivate to safety so that every person is a Safety leader in the performance of his or her job, lead-
ing by example thanks to the management’s commitment.

NEW DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR WORKER SAFETY

As part of the Smart Safety initiatives, Eni set up an information system comprising a series of sen-
sorized Personal Protection Equipment that, through a smart network, can activate, in real time, no-
tices to workers and a monitoring console, to point out potential danger or emergency situations. The
new digital technologies in the safety field are the pillars of the strategy and of the entire company’s
commitment in the innovation process.

Lastly, training and instructions sessions for operators on safety scenarios are continuing, sup-
ported by immersive virtual reality systems that allow to reproduce the real environment with
visual and sound effects, thus ensuring that the operations performed by the user are as faithful
to reality as possible.
