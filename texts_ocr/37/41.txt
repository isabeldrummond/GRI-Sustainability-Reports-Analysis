OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE MODEL

Biodiversity

Eni operates in multiple environmental contexts in the world, characterised by different ecological
sensitivities and different regulatory regimes. The management of biodiversity and of ecosystem
services (BES) is a key component of the environmental strategies as well as of the operating man-
agement practices. As specified in the BES Policy Eni ensures that the interrelations between envi-
ronmental aspects such as biodiversity, ecosystem services, climate change, management of water
resources and social issues of sustainable development of local communities, are identified and
managed correctly. Eni, in collaboration with international scientific partners, assesses the risks
deriving from both the complexity of each project, the natural environment value and of the local
social context. Through the application of the Mitigation Hierarchy, it prioritises preventive mitigation
measures, monitoring their effectiveness and adapting the management approach on the basis of
the observed results. In October 2019, Eni announced the formal commitment not to perform oil and
gas exploration and development activities within the boundaries of Natural Sites included in the
UNESCO World Heritage List (as at May 31, 2019; for more information, please refer to eni.com). The
announcement officially recognizes a policy that Eni is already pursuing in its own operations and
it represents an additional step in the path to the company’s tranformation. Building on its business
model Eni confirms both its own approach to the preservation of the natural environment in every
area with high biodiversity value and the promotion of good management practices in the joint ven-
tures where Eni is not an operator.

INTERVIEW WITH PIPPA HOWARD (FFI)
Fauna & Flora International (FFI) has worked with Eni since 2003 to identify biodiversity and

ecosystem services (BES) risk across its global exploration and production operations, working
directly with over 14 onshore and offshore subsidiaries across all geographies and contributing to
company-wide BES management practices.

What is the value of the partnership between Eni and FFI? Why is it beneficial for both of them?
Time in the field has been invaluable, with extraordinary transfer and sharing of knowledge between
the joint teams. FFI has learned a great deal about company HSE systems, lifecycle stages and activ-
ities of the Oil & Gas industry, whilst Eni has gained knowledge about the complexity of biodiversity
and ecosystems, their relevance to the social and environmental sustainability of the contexts of its
operations. Our partnership pre-empts and avoids risks associated with BES impacts and dependen-
cies. We are proud that Eni is among the leading O&G companies in BES management and continue
to value the work we undertake through our partnership.

In your experience with Eni, what were the challenges in implementing biodiversity projects and
the greatest satisfactions so far?

Our willingness to engage may implicitly endorse projects in areas that harbour globally important
biodiversity, but FFI’s overriding concern is to minimise their impact and ensure stringent application
of appropriate mitigation measures, in situations where development is inevitable. We are on a very
good path to net positive impact and success over the forthcoming decade will be rewarding.
Among the latest activities, we delivered a ground-breaking, bespoke, GlSweb-based tool for rapid
screening of BES sensitivities for operations within the Gulf of Mexico and we supported Eni in Egypt
in developing clear management plans across the Zohr and Nile Delta projects. We are proud to have
been explicit in the development of Eni’s commitment to biodiversity conservation and the full appli-
cation of the mitigation hierarchy in decision making, and particularly Eni’s commitment to “No Go”
in natural World Heritage Sites.
