Faced with increasingly complex and global events — poverty and inequality, health emergency, cli-
mate and migration crisis, political instability — Eni has chosen to extend the range of the development
initiatives, beyond the boundary of its own operating areas through alliances with respecetd partners
active locally and recognised internationally. The synergic action and the sharing of know-how that
derive from it are aimed at improving people's living conditions in the Countries of presence in line with
the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations, the Country plans and the NDCs. With major challenges, it is
absolutely essential to join forces and act together, valorizing shared factors with the different stake-
holders engaged in the areas of interest: from the International Organizations to the private sector, from
civil society to cooperation agencies that know the local region, the fragility and the primary needs of
the people who live in the areas where Eni is present. Hence, the value of the individual and hence the
need to identify partners able to ensure a long-term perspective to the actions. The financial and eco-
nomic crisis of 2008 caused a severe reduction of public for development due to Governments’ national
budget needs. Thus the invitation — stressed in the “Third international conference on development
funding” organised in Addis Abeba by the United Nations in July 2015 — to use new mechanisms and
forms of collaboration able to put together the public and the private sector. Enrico Mattei’s intuition
and Eni’s “vocation” in accompanying the growth of peoples and communities, which translates in the
aforementioned Dual Flag approach, are once again present and find fertile ground in the role attribut-
ed with growing awareness by the international community to the private sector, as the recent health
emergency demonstrates once again.

In this direction are moving, for example, Eni’s partnerships with International Agencies and Organisations
like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAQ), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and with a view to a broader collaboration the
patronage of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to the Musée
du Cercle Africain built in Pointe-Noire in Congo and Eni’s participation in the first Bienniale of Luanda, in
Angola - Pan-African forum for the Culture of Peace. It is also the direction of the relationships and collab-
orations with Italian and European institutions, financial entities and development banks, cooperation en-
tities and agencies, faith based organisations, universities and research centres. These are broad collabo-
rations that cut across sectors, in terms of action (access to energy, economic diversification, education,
access to water and sanitation, health), of geographic areas and Countries where Eni is present. Eni was
among the players of the energy and investment funds that participated in the dialogues promoted in the
Vatican in June 2018 and 2019 by the Notre Dame University and by the Dicastery for Promoting Integral
Human Development, “The Energy Transition and Care for Our Common Home”.
