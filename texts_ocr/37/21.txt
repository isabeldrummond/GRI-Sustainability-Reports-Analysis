Carbon neutrality
in the long term

 

Eni has embarked on

a decarbonization path
to rise to the crucial
challenge of the energy
sector: transition
towards a low carbon
future and access to
energy for a growing
world population.

The strategy adopted in
this direction comprises,
in addition to the
reduction of direct GHG
Cleo) ace sat)
development of the
renewables business and
new businesses based on
circularity, the research
effort, the development
of innovative solutions in
support of all activities
and a resilient
hydrocarbon portfolio in
which gas, as is pointed
out in all IEA scenarios,
will play a significant
role, by virtue of its
lower carbon intensity
and of the possibility

of integration with
renewable sources in
electricity generation,
while promoting the
reduction of coal
consumption.
