ENI FOR 2019

People’s health

Eni believes that health protection is essential and promotes the physical, psychological and social
well-being of its own people, of the families and of the communities of the Countries in which it op-
erates. The extreme variability of the business contexts in which Eni operates, from the geographic,
climatic, epidemiologic, social, political and regulatory viewpoint, requires constantly revising health
risk matrices and makes it particularly challenging to assure health in each phase of the life cycle of
the business projects. To rise to this challenge, Eni developed a specific operating platform, ensuring
services through workplace medicine, industrial hygiene, traveller medicine, health care assistance
and medical emergency activities, and through initiatives promoting health for its own people and
for communities.
