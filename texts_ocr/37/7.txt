Eni’s transformation process, launched 6 years ago, underlines the companys intention to play a defining
role in a socially fair energy transition to a low-carbon future, a key requirement of the Paris Agreement
and of the labour guidelines of the United Nations’ International Labour Organisation (ILO). As stressed in
the new corporate mission, which includes a clear reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
Eni’s effort is aimed at rising, with concrete, fast-acting and economically sustainable solutions, to the chal-
lenge of improving access to reliable, clean energy, combating climate change. According to the 2019 SDG
Index, which measures progress towards the full achievement of the SDGs, a different level of achievement
of the SDGs worldwide is readily apparent, in particular between OECD and Non-OECD Countries. To achieve
the SDGs, UNCTAD (World Investment Report 2014) estimated a financial gap in developing Countries of
US$2.5 trillion annually. Therefore, unprecedented cooperation is required between companies and play-
ers, such as governmental institutions and civil society, to create a new development model, sustainable
from the economic, social and environmental viewpoint, propelled by efficiency and technology.

The path to energy transition is made even more challenging by the current, constantly evolving sce-
nario: on one hand, demographic growth in non-OECD Countries implies a significant increase in energy
demand, on the other hand combating climate change requires reducing atmospheric GHG emissions.
As a result of demographic growth, there will be 1.6 billion more people in 2040 compared to the 2.6 bil-
lion in 2018, approximately 45% of whom will be in Sub-Saharan Africa. The International Energy Agency
(IEA) has identified two main energy paths: a Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and a decarbonised,
Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). In the first one, global energy demand is forecast to grow by
24% in 2040 from the 2018 levels, driven mainly by non-OECD Countries (+42%), while in the second
one consumption would contract from 2018, sustained mostly by efficiency and energy savings meas-
ures concentrated in the OECD area.
