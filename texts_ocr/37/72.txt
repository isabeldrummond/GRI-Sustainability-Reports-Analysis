ENI FOR 2019

These three dimensions are measured according to three different levels of analysis: “direct” effects
generated by Eni’s activities, “indirect” effects generated by the first level of the supply chain, “induced”
effects referred to the macroeconomic sectors of the Country involved in the project.

The ELCE model is characterised by high adaptability to different contexts, which ensure that “local”
impact will be considered in the way that is closest to the economic reality of each Country. Some ex-
amples are the alternative methods used to identify “local” purchasing expenses, such as payments in
the local currency, or the percentage of participation of local companies in consortiums.

Application of the ELCE Model to the Area 1 project in Mexico
The offshore project, situated in the Campeche bay, has a 25-year duration (2016-2040)
with production starting in 2019.

Eni Impact Tool: evaluation of the benefits of local development projects

Eni has developed Eni Impact Tool, a model for assessing the changes generated by a local develop-
ment project on the living conditions of the communities. Understanding the long term impact of the so-
cial, economic and environmental dimensions is essential to plan future investments and ensure they
are adjusted over time. In 2019, in collaboration with the Agricultural Department of the University of
Milan and thanks to what already developed for the energy sector”, the Eni Impact Tool was extended
to the agricultural sector. This analysis involves a plurality of initiatives, such as training on agronomic
practices, technical and financial support to entrepreneurs, pushing towards horizontal and vertical
supply chain integration. In the frame of the local development project in Ghana, the collection of initial
data to define the baseline is currently ongoing, which will be functional for a further assessment of the
impact of the diversification of income sources on the population's living standards. The model assess-
es the tangible and intangible resources of a community according to 5 “capitals” (natural, physical,
human, social and financial), described by dimensions and indicators recognized at international level.
An additional development of the model will refer directly to the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda.
