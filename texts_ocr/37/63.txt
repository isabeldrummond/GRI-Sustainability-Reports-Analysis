Land Management

Land Management activities are those connected with the assessment of the impacts deriving from the
acquisition of lands in which Eni operates to define any alternatives and mitigation measures. Eni man-
ages these activities according to the following principles: i) selection of design alternatives, to minimise
consequences for local communities; ii) timely and transparent compensation and livelihood restoration,
if dislocation is inevitable; iii) informed consultation and participation from the initial land identification
stages; iv] non-discrimination and active participation, for vulnerable groups, v) access to the grievance
management process. In 2019, Eni was engaged in land management activities in Mozambique, in Ka-
zakhstan and in Ghana. In Mozambique, as part of the JV Area 4 of the Rovuma LNG project for the produc-
tion of natural gas from the Mamba complex, activities continued for the relocation of the Afungi area pop-
ulations. Several community infrastructures were completed along with approximately 500 dwellings, and
compensation and livelihood restoration programs continued. In Kazakhstan, between 2018 and 2019,
the KPO consortium carried out post-relocation monitoring (2015-2017) to respond to the suggestions
and grievances received from residents. Activities included providing assistance to members of vulnera-

ble communities living in isolation, land for 100 dwellings and fixing construction defects in the residents
houses in Araltal and the two 9 storey apartment blocks built for resettled households in the city of Aksai.
In Ghana, to manage the socio-economic changes on communities due to the construction of the natural
gas processing plant of the OCTP Project, Eni launched the Livelihood Restoration Plan to restore the in-
come-generating activities of the involved families and improve their living conditions, as defined by the
IFC standards on land acquisition and involuntary relocation.

Eni Ghana is implementing a land acquisition, involuntary resettlement and compensation process
resulting in a Livelihood Restoration Plan (LRP) for the Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP) project,
in compliance with the International Finance Corporation’s Environmental and Social Performance
Standards. Share your thoughts on why implementation of the Standards is important to restoring
livelihoods of the households impacted by the project.

The OCTP project is unusual in that the displacement is economic displacement only, not physical di-
splacement, for a large percentage of the same community. This enables a reliable analysis of impact
on livelihoods and an accurate assessment of the effectiveness of the livelihood restoration measu-
res based on IFC’s Performance Standard 5 (PS5) which requires clients to develop and implement an
LRP when economic displacement occurs. This underscores the important objective of the IFC standard
to improve or restore livelihoods of displaced persons, integrating what it isn’t matched by national
standards in some legislation, which do not provide compensation for the economic displacement and/

The LRP was launched in 20146 and is planned to end in January 2021. How do you evaluate the ca-
pacity of restoring livelihood conditions at least to a pre-project level through the implementation
of its three main components [Transitional Support Food Aid, Financial Management Training, Live-
lihood Restoration Support Services)? What are the synergies between the LRP and the Community
Investment Strategy (CIS)?

Baseline information is key. Socio-economic indicators are used to determine if livelihoods and quali-
ty of life are comparable, better or worse than before. Data suggest that transitional support food aid
helped maintain the livelihoods of affected people. Poultry and egg production, piggeries, and dres-
smaking workshops are some examples showing that livelihoods are improving through the implemen-
tation of the LRP The CIS examines not only the project-affected community, but nearby communities
as well, helping to maximize positive impact and avoid inequality. The activities of the LRP and CIS go
hand in hand and establish a continuum of measure that starts from mitigation and tends to improve
livelihoods and other aspects of quality of life (local employment opportunities, better health, educa-
tion and of access to water).
