ALLIANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

rking in synergy

The Director General of UNIDO, Li Yong, tells the value
of parnerships between international organizations and businesses.
The strength of these collaborations comes from the alignment

of corporate goals and development objectives.

The SDG no. 1? — Partnerships for the Goals — is of crucial importance as it can be a driver to
help achieve the other SDGs. In what way do you think the private sector can contribute to the
development of the Countries and create added value for a sustainable local development?

While adopting the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the global develop-
ment community also realized that traditional Official Development Assistance was wholly inad-
equate to fuel this ambitious plan: the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda sees innovative partner-
ships — across Countries, amongst multilateral and bilateral development practitioners and, most
importantly, between public and private actors — as key to the success of the 2030 Agenda. The
November 5, 2019 was a defining moment for our Organization, because the UNIDO Member States
have adopted the Abu Dhabi Declaration, which clearly highlights the important role of the private
sector in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Private firms can bring about technologi-
cal change, invest, share know-how, demonstrate sustainable practices, raise local skills, support
vocational training, and facilitate market access through their supply chains. By virtue of its busi-
ness-oriented mandate, UNIDO has a long tradition of partnerships with private firms, predicated
not on charity or philanthropy, but on an alignment of corporate goals and development objec-
tives: the approach is to define this common ground with the prospective partner, clearly artic-
ulate the shared objectives and the path to reach them, negotiate a fair distribution of the costs
of the joint action, and set in place the metrics that will help both parties monitor the progress of

their association.

What role does industrial development have in the growth and development of a Country?
In what way are these factors connected to peace and migration issues?

Industrial development has a multiplier effect on labour productivity, innovation, economic growth
and, most importantly, employment. That is particularly true in developing Countries where a large
share of the labour force lives off low productivity agriculture, while the rapid demographic growth
makes for a rapidly expanding, youthful labour force. Offering decent work and attractive employ-
ment opportunities in small and medium enterprises contributes to reduced migration pressures
by stabilizing not only the one employed, but the extended family s/he typically support. In Coun-
tries marked by endemic unemployment, the youth are easy targets for various groups engaged
in civil disturbances, criminality or terrorism. As part of its mandate of promoting Inclusive and
Sustainable Industrial Development, UNIDO focuses in particular on the rural hinterland and on

vulnerable segments of society, such as the youth and women.

Eni and UNIDO’s joint declaration is a new, pioneering public-private cooperation model aimed
at helping reach the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. What is the added value of such col-
laboration? How can this joint declaration become fruitful in a timely manner?

Eni and UNIDO signed in July 2019 a Joint Declaration, and | am very encouraged to see today,

hardly six months later, a range of initiatives in the agro-processing sector to diversify local live-
