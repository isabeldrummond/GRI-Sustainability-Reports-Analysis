Borehole Powered

The context

To deal with the water crisis caused by the shrinking of Lake Chad and the humanitarian emergency
triggered by the Boko Haram movement in northeastern Nigeria, in 2018 Eni and FAO signed a three-
year collaboration agreement to promote access to clean and safe water in the Country by building
water wells powered by photovoltaic systems, for domestic use and for irrigation.

The project

The partnership identifies, in collaboration with local authorities, the areas of intervention to support
the IDPs (internally displaced persons) and host communities affected by the North East — Lake Chad
crisis, through technical support and sharing of know-how by the United Nations agency and the con-
struction of water wells by Eni.
