Emergency preparedness and response

Emergency reaction procedures are constantly tested in exercises, essential for preparedness in cases
of emergency, testing the ability to respond in terms of plans, resources, means and materials and
identifying appropriate corrective actions. The main centrally coordinated drills were carried out in
the Livorno Refinery, the Versalis Porto Torres Plant and in the foreign affiliate Eni Congo. It was also
strengthened the analysis of the reaction to real emergencies and pre-alarm events (events not gen-
erating emergencies but observable externally) and also to events deriving from natural causes. In
this regard, the Natural Risk culture was strengthened, holding a themed workshop on meteo-hydro
alerting.

CAMPI FLEGREI NATIONAL DRILL

In 2019, collaboration continued with the Italian Civil Protection Department, through which Eni intends
to further increase awareness of the natural hazards to which its people and assets are exposed, and
to refine its own preparedness and reaction to emergencies triggered by natural phenomena. In October
2019, with a directive of the President of the Council of Ministers, the “National civil protection week”
was established to spread civil protection awareness and culture throughout Italy and to promote citi-
zens’ adoption of aware behaviours and self-protection measures. On this occasion, “ExeFlegrei19”, the
national exercise for volcanic risk, was carried out to test civil protection planning activities for volcanic
risk; to do this, the Civil Protection Department and the Campania Region, involved the municipalities
of the Phlegraean Fields red zone, the regional sectors (health care, mobility and transports) and the
Organizations and Institutions involved in national Planning. Eni actively participated in all phases of
the test, with resources, means and equipment actually deployed in the field, since it has a strong
presence with its activities in the Neapolitan area, both Phlegraean and Vesuvian.
