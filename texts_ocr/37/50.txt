ENI FOR 2019

Eni’s Anti-Corruption Compliance Program

Consistently with the “zero tolerance” principle expressed in the Code of Ethics, Eni adopted a com-
prehensive system of rules and controls for the prevention of corruption offences: the Anti-Corruption
Compliance Program. The core of this program resides in Eni’s top management commitment and in
the set of internal anti-corruption regulations that apply to Eni SpA and to all its subsidiaries. The im-
plementation of the program has been assured, since 2010, by a dedicated organisational structure
(Anti-Corruption Unit) whose task is to provide specialist anti-corruption assistance to Eni and to its
subsidiaries. To prevent possible critical issues, the Compliance Program calls for the execution of an-
ti-corruption due diligence on counterparties at risk aimed at assessing the integrity, professional reli-

ability and reputation of the potential counterparty.

COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING

Another pillar of the program is represented by the anti-corruption training activities:

e-learning courses, online courses for the entire corporate population;

© general workshops, interactive training sessions for resources in medium/high corruption risk context;

¢ job specific training, training sessions generally administered together with the general workshops
and intended for professional areas under specific risk of corruption.

To optimize the identification of the recipients of the training initiatives, a methodology was defined

in 2018 and applied in 2019, for the segmentation of employees on the basis of the corruption risk

according to risk drivers such as: Country, qualification, professional family and number of employees

of the site. In 2019, 23,347 employees were trained, of whom 59% were resources in medium/high

corruption risk context. Moreover, in 2019 training activities continued online and in the classroom, for

some categories of Eni’s Business Associates to sensitise them on the issue of corruption (in particular

how to recognise a corruptive behaviour and how to prevent the violation of anti-corruption laws in their

professional activity).
