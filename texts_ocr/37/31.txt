OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE MODEL

Training

Consolidation and evolution of competencies are essential for operational excellence in a context of
fast transformation of the company. Every year, training needs are mapped and assessed according to
specific needs and subsequently, in all Countries, training courses disseminated across the board, pro-
jects for professional families and specialist initatives for strategic activities with high technical con-
tent are planned and carried out. With reference to the global scenario and in particular to innovative
and strategic matters, such as digitalization, energy transition and climate changes, Eni administers
ad hoc training paths. In 2019, in addition to the training activities, involvement activities continued
on matters connected with climate change, also under the auspices of the Chief Executive Officer, to
enhance internal awareness on the relevance of these matters. In addition, the “Virtual Reality Train-
ing” method was consolidated; it allows training to be administered through immersive virtual reality
systems both for HSE and for drilling.

knowledge of
employees is a key
