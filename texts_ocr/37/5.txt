A strong love for Italy and great respect for different cultures, 67 years ago, led Enrico Mattei to
achieve a dream enclosed in a small word with a great future: Eni. Italy as a starting Country for a
trip towards distant shores. A bold path taken by inventing a new national energy policy that would
entail the broadest possible participation by the host Nation in the technical and administrative
management of the activities launched in various Countries. Thus was launched Eni’s “Dual Flag”
strategy, which to this day is a distinctive feature of the model of cooperation in the 66 Countries
where Eni is active. This approach translates into constant interactions with local institutions and
stakeholders, to identify the initiatives necessary to meet the needs of the communities, whose
development strategies are strengthened with the launch of partnerships also with international
bodies that, sharing not only economic resources, but also skills, know-how and experience, contrib-
ute to improving quality of life and achievement of the SDGs. All this is ensured by the skills, energy
and passion that Eni’s 31,321 people put in everything they do. Our actions stem from curiosity,
concreteness and the commitment for technological innovation and progress, to face to the most
important challenge of the industry: making energy resources accessible efficiently and sustainably
for everyone, combating climate change. The key to take on this challenge is enclosed in one word:
transformation. Eni is transforming its own business, not only to keep up with the constantly evolv-
ing global scenario, but to anticipate its requirements. The new Eni will supply highly decarbonised
energy products and will be ever more enhanced by businesses such as renewable energies and
circular economy, thus actively contributing to the energy transition process. Innovation anchored
to tradition: a forward-looking company that stays faithful to its history and to its non-negotiable
values, such as integrity, respect for people and environmental protection.
