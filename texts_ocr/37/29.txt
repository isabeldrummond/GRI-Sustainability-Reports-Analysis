OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE MODEL

Diversity & Inclusion - The culture of plurality

Every person with his and her individual personality contributes to create value in support of Eni’s ob-
jectives and major transformations. In 2019, Eni promoted a series of initiatives directed at increasing
inclusion sensitivity, such as the internal communication formats entitled “D&I Matters”, focusing on
Unconscious Bias” and the freely accessed courses in Eni’s training platform to provide perspectives
and tools to recognise the value of every type of diversity.

Eni’s strong international presence has always been characterised by strong alliances with host Coun-
tries, with the goal of creating value also through the transfer of knowledge, while respecting local
cultures. Confirming this in the upstream sector, the percentage of local employees out of the entire
workforce increases markdely in the Countries of Eni’s historical presence (86%) (e.g. Nigeria, Congo,
Egypt, Libya and Kazakhstan) compared to Countries of recent entry (e.g. Mexico, United Arab Emir-
ates and Myanmar), where the know-how transfer process is still ongoing. Moreover, in all Countries
where it operates, Eni guarantees minimum remuneration levels for local personnel significantly above
the market's.
