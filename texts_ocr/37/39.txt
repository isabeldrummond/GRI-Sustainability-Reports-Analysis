Oil spill management

Eni makes a daily effort to manage risks deriving from oil spills both in Italy and abroad, through
actions that are always integrated at all levels, from the administrative to the technical areas of
prevention, control and quality/rapidity/effectiveness. Environmental impacts from sabotage are de-
fended against and contrasted through clean-up actions, preceded and followed by joint inspections
with the appointed Authorities and by remediation and restoration projects. In Italy, the installation
of e-vpms® (Eni Vibroacustic Pipeline Monitoring System) and other initiatives of recent years have
allowed to eliminate trespassing and reduce operational events; for two Italian pipelines, testing con-
tinues on the TPI (Third Party Intrusion} system to detect activities near pipelines (such as excava-
tion work or vehicular traffic) and to allow to prevent the sabotage activities.

OIL SPILLS IN NIGERIA

In recent years, Eni facilities in Nigeria (wells, flow lines and pipelines covering approximately 3,000 km)
were the targets of illegal activities leading to significant losses. In 2019, for example, compared to the
previous year, an increase in the number of oil spills occurred, highlighting that well over 90% of the spills
were caused by sabotage events. Presumably the cause of this increase is attributable to social tensions
and the climate of greater insecurity during the 2019 election period. In response, Eni developed an inte-
grated strategy to prevent, reduce, contain these events and clean up the impacts and in Nigeria it has set
the “zero oil spill” objective for itself, to be achieved through a series of actions:

* prevention through asset integrity, maintenance and application of techniques for the early detection of
losses, damages or break-in activities near pipelines, reducing reaction times and spills (e-vpms® and
SSPS - Safety Security Pipeline System tools);

increased surveillance activities, from the air and with the support of local communities;

containment and recovery of spills with tracing systems with geo-referenced localisation of sabotage
points, and customised technology for the prompt repair of the pipeline;

promotion of projects for local development, with the involvement of the affected parties;

awareness campaign directed at local communities and institutions, to increase awareness of the dan-
gers deriving from sabotage on oil infrastructures.

These initiatives have allowed to plan actions and strategies aimed at recovering oil and reducing the num-
ber and especially the volume of spills over time. In particular, with respect to 2015, operational oil spill vol-
umes were reduced by 45% and sabotage spills by 41%. In parallel, in 2019 36% of spills from sabotage and
70% of operational spills were recovered, recording an increase in the percentages recovered compared
to 2018 (when 33% and 60% were recovered respectively) and also, especially, 2015 (with an increase
compared to 2019 of 44% and 160% respectively).
