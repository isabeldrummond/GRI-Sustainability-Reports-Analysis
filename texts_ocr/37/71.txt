The use of tools and methodologies, in line with internationally recognised standards, is fundamental

through the different business phases in order to:

* understand the context and define local development projects through tools for context analy-
sis (p. 53) and assessing any human rights impacts (e.g. Human Rights Impact Assessment,
p. 64);

* map the relationship with stakeholders with the Stakeholder Management System (p. 63);

* monitor the progress of the projects and the results achieved through dedicated management tools
(e.g. Logical Framework Approach, Monitoring and Evaluation and Learning);

* assess the impact and quantify the benefits generated by Eni in the business operating environment
and through the cooperation model (e.g. Eni Local Content Evaluation Model and Eni Impact Tool).

More details of some tools not yet described in the chapter are provided below.

Eni Local Content Evaluation - ELCE Model
ELCE model: supports The ELCE model, developed by Eni in 2016 and validated by Politecnico di Milano, supports the meas-

the measurement of urement of the value generated by Eni through its business projects both locally and nationally. The
the value generated total value emerges by the measurement of the benefits brought to the economy, to society and to
by Eni through its communities in the project life-span by measuring three dimensions:

business projects * ECONOMIC IMPACT generated by local purchases, wages paid to local employees and taxes paid to
both locally and the local government;

nationally ¢ EMPLOYMENT IMPACT in terms of jobs generated by Eni’s projects directly, along the supply chain and

within the local economy affected by the project;
© HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT promoted by the training activities performed by Eni for the local
employees directly involved in the business project.

What is the value of applying a replicable Model to calculate the value generated at local level?
A company’s legitimacy in operating both in developed and in developing Countries also depends on
its ability to demonstrate that it actively contributes to socio-economic development in the Country,
creating wealth, offering employment opportunities and developing human capital. For this very pur-
pose, Eni has developed a replicable model (ELCE} that establishes a conceptual framework to ana-
lyse the impacts generated by the company, providing useful indicators to quantify each of them. The
model adopts a conservative approach, inasmuch as it focuses on local content components that can
be measured more objectively and reliably.

Recognising complexity in analysing local content, which approach should be followed to proper-
ly manage it?

The process that led to the definition of the ELCE model was complex. From the conceptual standpoint,
there is no unambiguous definition of local content and Countries adopt specific policies. This led to
the need to define a shared framework, applicable in any context, that allows to integrate and consider
specific local features. The choice to create an interfunctional project team between Eni and Politecnico
di Milano was particularly important both to validate the model, and to have a constant conversation
with Eni people living and working in host Countries. This has allowed to better understand the context,
formulate the right hypotheses and critically interpret the results.
