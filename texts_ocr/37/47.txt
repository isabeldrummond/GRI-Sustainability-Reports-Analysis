OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE MODEL

Human rights in the supply chain: management of suppliers

and business partners

Eni, aware of the significant role of its supply chain in the fulfillment of its social responsibilities
commitments, has implemented a management model aimed at promoting its own values with sup-
pliers and to involve them in the risk prevention process. This model ensures that Eni monitors its
suppliers constantly, and it may even suspend contracts if suppliers do not meet the minimum
acceptability standards set by Eni. In 2019, approximately 6,000 suppliers were subjected to screen-
ing and assessment on sustainability issues: in 15% of the cases, potential critical issues/areas of
improvement have been identified, but in 89% of them they did not compromise the possibility of
working with them.

Eni is also carrying out numerous engagement initiatives with suppliers, for example:

* Local meetings for local companies, organised in collaboration with trade associations and/or lo-
cal authorities, during which Eni’s sustainability values and principles are illustrated;

* Individual meetings with selected suppliers within the scope of assessments on human rights,
to create awareness on the promotion and respect for human rights; in 2019, 9 suppliers were
involved, of which 3 from Vietnam, 1 from Ecuador, 1 from Mexico and 4 from Tunisia;

* Annual events with the participation and recognition of suppliers with the best safety perfor-
mance who also distinguished themselves by their coimmitment (Safety & Environment Day).
Eni, moreover, is finalising and subsequently diffusing a code of conduct for suppliers, which con-

firms the importance of respect for the cardinal principles of sustainability in the supply chain.

Lastly, more generally referring to Eni’s business partners, starting from 2018 specific human rights

clauses were introduced in the agreements stipulated with the Countries and with the other compa-

nies in activities managed through Joint Ventures, to represent and bind the parties to behave in line
with the main international standards and to exercise an appropriate form of leverage on them. Every
business partner is also subjected to a preventive screening to identify the presence of any criti-
cal issues referred to respect for human rights and to provide the appropriate measures to manage

them. In this area, over 70 new business partners were screened in 2019.

Additional actions to combat the forms of modern slavery and human trafficking and to prevent the

exploitation of minerals associated with human rights violations in the supply chain are further dis-

cussed in the Slavery and human trafficking statement and in the Position on “Conflict minerals”,
both available on the eni.com website.
