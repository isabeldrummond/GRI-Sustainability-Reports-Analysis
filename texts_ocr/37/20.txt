ENI FOR 2019

Digitalization

The digital transformation launched by Eniis a process that changes people's way of working, exploiting
the potential of digital technologies. Digital transformation is an opportunity for everyone: it allows to
operate more safely (see p. 33), it provides for new ways of working, it fosters and enhances compe-
tencies. Through interaction with technology, people act more rapidly, efficiently and flexibly, allowing
the company to be more sustainable with respect to the environment and to stakeholders and more
competitive in the reference market, sustaining energy transition. For the transformation to take place
organically, a structured change management path is necessary, to renew the corporate culture and
change the traditional approach to work, identifying more flexible, streamlined paths and appropri-
ate tools to involve people rationally and emotionally. In 2019, €105 million were invested in digital
transformation focused on personnel safety, asset integrity, efficiency and effectiveness of operat-
ing and internal processes and attention to customers, obtaining economic benefits in the amount of
€173 million. These benefits originate from upstream (drilling, reservoir, surface facility management,
inspection, survey and mapping using drones], Refining & Marketing and Eni gas e luce (customer
value & centricity areas).

The components of the digital transformation
DIGITAL BUSINESS UNIT

Serves of all Eni business lines for the digital
transformation of the company.

DIGITAL COMPETENCE CENTER

To enhance systems and methods, hire, train,
develop new professional roles and for the
upskilling of traditional roles. The study of Big Data

“LIGHTHOUSE” PROJECTS provides useful information for Eni’s activities.

For the digitalization in Italy and abroad of
upstream industrial plants (offshore and
onshore], downstream plants (refineries and
petrochemical sites), to improve the efficiency,
safety and sustainability of the operations.

PROCESSES
Digitalization of business support functions

such as integrated risk management,
negotiation activities, audits.

 

         
     
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    

OPEN INNOVATION CALL

1) Innovation challenge for defining new Data Science models and predictions for Security;
2) “Digital HR: innovate to grow” call for training and for renewing the engagement, feedback
and employee relations management process; 3) “Smart&Efficient Buildings” call by Eni gas
e luce to make buildings more efficient, independent, safe and comfortable.

LAUNCH OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE SUPER-COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE GREEN DATA CENTER
In October 2019, Eni started building the new HPC5 supercomputing system, commissioned in early
2020, supporting the ongoing digitalization and transformation path.

The new HPCS supercomputing system is added to the current HPC4, compared to which it triples com-
puting power, allowing the execution of 52 million billion mathematical operations per second. From
2020 onwards, the entire structure of the Green Data Center has a total peak power of 70 PetaFlop/s.
BIG DATA: HPCS5 allows the use of “big data” generated during the operations of all productive assets,
and allows to further accelerate Eni’s transformation path thanks to the improvement in the processes
relating to the new energy sources, supporting the development energy from the sea, research on mag-
netic confinement fusion, on climate and on technologies for the environment.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY: HPCS was developed to achieve the highest possible level of energy efficiency,
also exploiting the energy generated by the photovoltaic field installed at the Green Data Center, thereby
reducing emissions and operating costs.

"The inauguration

of the HPCS is an
important time in

the path toward the
energy transition. It's
another step forward
towards the global
goal that we share
with our research and
technology partners:
making tomorrow's
energy an even closer
reality"
