tools directed at improving employees’ well-being.

In 2019 Eni began a corporate volunteering project with Fondazione Banco Alimentare. Employees who
signed up to the initiative were followed internally by a multi-disciplinary working group. They got the
chance to volunteer for a day at the Fondazione Banco Alimentare’s warehouses, near their workplaces
in different cities in Italy. In this project, Eni’s goal is to encourage active and voluntary participation
in the life of local communities by its employees, during working hours. This project is right in line with
Eni’s way of doing business, as defined in its new mission, which is concerned with respect for people
and creating shared value. The corporate volunteering project is set to go on in 2020, also with other
various potential forms of outreach volunteering. Through this kind of volunteering, Eni aims to encour-
age and support active and voluntary participation in the life of local communities by its employees,
even during working hours, working with many local non-profit organisations to meet the needs of dif-
ferent local areas.
