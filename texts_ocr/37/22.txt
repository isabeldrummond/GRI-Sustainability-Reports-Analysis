STEPS SDS

Gas, favored by the high efficiency of the plants and by low emissions coefficients, is the only fossil fuel that is increasing its mix amount both
in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and in the decarbonised scenario (SDS), continuing to account for around a *4 of energy needs in 2040.
