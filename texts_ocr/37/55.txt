Ensuring unversal access to energy efficiently and sustainably is the main challenge of the energy
sector and it is at the centre of the process of transition towards a low carbon future, as also confirmed
in the corporate mission. In this context, aware that the fight against energy poverty is the first step to
meet the primary needs of education, health and economic diversification, Eni promotes the construc-
tion of infrastructure for the production and transport of gas and facilitates access to electricity, as
integral parts of its business model.

Construction of infrastructure for the production and transport of gas

Eni invests in the construction of infrastructure for the production and transport of gas both for export,
and for local consumption through energy generation, promoting on one hand the development of mar-
kets where it is present and on the other hand the attainment of new ones. In 2019, the Takoradi-Tema
Interconnection Project continued in Ghana with the goal of increasing gas use also in the Eastern part
of the Country by increasing the flow rate towards the Takoradi hub and the WAPCo* facilities by approx-
imately 2.5 times; other initiatives were carried out in Indonesia, where the construction of a dedicated
pipeline in East Borneo will allow to increase LPG production for the domestic market. Eni’s approach
also allows to ensure energy independence in several Countries, for example in Egypt where, thanks to
the discovery of the Zohr reservoir, whose production already fully remains in the Country, the founda-
tions for energy independence have been created and in Libya, where Eni continues to supply almost
all of the gas needed to fuel its power stations.

Eni provides energy to the local markets, having supplied them in 2019 with over 73% of the total gas sold, for an
amount of more than 64 billion Sm*. In particular, in 12 Countries Eni distributes 100% of the total gas sold.

Construction of thermal power stations

In Sub-Saharan Africa, Eni makes investments for the construction of thermal power stations thanks to
the valorisation of the associated gas which was disposed of by flaring. The objective is to diversify the
energy mix, made up of 50% biomass and coal, introducing a cleaner source like natural gas. In 2019,
the activities to increase the electricity generating capacity of the CEC power station in Congo through
the construction of the third turbine were completed, as well as the revamping of 4 power stations in
Libya that generate 2GW of power, enough to ensure more stable access to electricity to approximately
two million people (about 1/3 of the entire Libyan population), threatened by continuous black-outs
caused by the conditions of neglect of the power stations.

16) In addition, in early 2020 the second phase of the project was launched, with the goal of doubling the flow rate towards Tema as well.
