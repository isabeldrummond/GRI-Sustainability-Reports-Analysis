AN EXAMPLE OF PROMOTION OF LOCAL DEVELOPMENT IN MOZAMBIQUE

In Mozambique, for example, Eni has developed a dedicated Local Content strategy in support of the
Coral South project that aims at enhancing the inclusion of the Mozambican workforce and of local
small and medium enterprises also through the involvement of its own main suppliers.

Training, in particular, is an essential lever to sustain the development of the new generations; there-
fore, actions have been launched to transmit competencies to the local workforce through specialist
Oil & Gas training programs, vocational training and sharing know-how in the long term for over 800
Mozambican resources during the operational phase of the project.
