Treatment and storage of liquid and solid
waste

The technological solutions adopted for the
treatment of solid waste are entrusted to the
converters. The use of these machines enables
waste to be dried and sterilized. The reduction
in volume and weight and subsequent
automatic vacuum storage allow on-board
retention to be increased. The modern
converters adopted enable a volume reduction
of 70% and weight reduction of 30%.

For liquid waste, we have adopted
technological solutions that are in line with
the international regulations already used for
merchant vessels:

¢ IMO MEPC 227 (62) for grey water and
sewage treatment.

¢ IMO MEPC 107 (49) for bilge water
treatment.

Grey water and sewage are collected into
appropriate physical and chemical treatment
units which macerate the suspended

solids and reduce the contents of the Total
Suspended Solids (TSS), Biochemical Oxygen
Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen
Demand (COD) using aerobic processes. The
process also envisages disinfection using UV
systems.

The systems adopted are able to achieve BOD
values of 25 mg/| and COD values of 125 mg/l.
Bilge water is treated using units that separate
the pollutants caused by accidental spills.

The system is based on physical processes

for viscosity reduction and then absorption
using coalescent filters. Separation enables the
level of pollutants in the treated water to be

kept under control, guaranteeing a maximum
concentration of 15 ppm.

As regards end of life, all naval vessels are
also delivered with a Green Passport. This
document is the inventory of materials to be
monitored during the ship’s life cycle and it
is used to ensure that it is scrapped safely
and in an environmentally friendly way.

In line with the Environmental Policy
guidelines and the objectives of the
Sustainability Plan, the design process has
been revised with reference to the basic
principles and logic of eco-sustainable
design and the related requirements have

been incorporated into a specific procedure.

As part of this, and with reference to the
different environmental aspects, we have
defined criteria to enhance internally the
technological solutions adopted for each
ship built. This approach makes it possible
to compare the different constructions and

to monitor the product’s environmental
sustainability trends over time.

The foundation of the entire process of
eco-sustainable design lies in the ability
to contain and improve the environmental

 

Identifying solutions that reduce energy
consumption, atmospheric emissions, waste
production and improve the environmental
impact of the production process and
materials used, taking as reference similar
products as well as “best in class”, therefore
benefits the entire context (oopulation and
surrounding area) in which the individual
production site is located.

managing the ship during its operation and
its performance, in addition to seeking to
contain consumption and minimize the impact

on the environment, have the additional
purpose of making work easier and making
the hospitality provided on board more
comfortable.

Finally, it should be stressed that sustainability
assessments are also taken into account with
regard to decommissioning activities, helping
to guide choices on materials, components
and systems with characteristics that limit

the environmental impact of the dismantling
and disposal operations at the end of

the product’s life, which remain the sole
responsibility of the shipowner.
