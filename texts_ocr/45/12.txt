Set up in 2016 by Fincantieri’s Board of Directors, it is composed of 4 independent members. In accordance with the By-

Laws and the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies, the Committee is tasked with supporting, with adequate
investigative activities, both proactive and advisory, the assessments and decisions made by the Board on sustainability
issues connected with the Company activities and the dynamics of its interaction with all stakeholders. In particular, the
Committee supports the Board in relation to the Company's respect for and promotion of human rights, labour rights,

the environment, transparency and combating corruption, health and safety within the Company's activities, the rights

of all stakeholders, product liability and its innovation. The Committee has the right to access the company information
and functions necessary in order to perform its duties. In order to carry out its tasks, the Committee may use external
consultants, through the Company’s structures, provided they are suitably bound to the necessary confidentiality.

The Chairman of the Committee reports on the Committee’s activities to the Board of Directors at the earliest opportunity.
The Committee met 6 times in 2019.
