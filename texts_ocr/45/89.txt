In particular, we have validated and applied
on our ships a series of initiatives, included
in the company’s “Eco-sustainable Design”

procedure, that are also aimed at energy
saving and reducing air pollution.

Reduction of harmful air emissions

MARPOL also requires a progressive reduction
in emissions of harmful gases, in particular
sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides
(NOx). The constraints are growing over time,
and they are particularly stringent in Emission
Control Areas (ECA), which broadly identify

The currently most common configuration
for emissions reduction is based on latest
generation diesel engines combined with the
installation of fume purification systems in the
exhaust systems.

the most vulnerable ecosystems, where the
most stringent values for reducing harmful
emissions are applied, and which coincide with
the main operating areas of the cruise industry.
European legislation (Directive 2012/33/EU)
sets further emission limits, particularly in

port areas, due to their proximity to intensely
inhabited areas.

Another method which is gradually being
established is the substitution of traditional
fuels with liquefied natural gas (LNG) in
view of the indisputable benefits in terms of
emission impact.

Fincantieri already built a special LNG-
powered ferry for Canada in the past and in
2019 it received orders for prototype “dual-
fuel” cruise ships primarily powered by LNG:

¢ Tui Cruises Goint venture between TUI
AG and Royal Caribbean Cruises)
finalized the order of two new-generation
cruise ships with a gross tonnage of
approximately 161,000 and primarily
powered by LNG. Energy efficiency is one
of the features of the project, with the dual
objective of containing consumption under
operation and minimizing environmental
impact;

e Princess Cruises, the Carnival group brand,
finalized the order for the construction
of two cruise ships with a gross tonnage
of 175,000. The vessels will house
approximately 4,300 passengers and will
be based on a new-generation project,
becoming the first of the Princess Cruises
fleet to be powered mainly by LNG.

Another solution for reducing emissions

is to build electric or hybrid vessels. The
Norwegian subsidiary VARD has contracts
and offers for various small/medium-sized
vessels equipped with electric batteries to
cover all or part of the energy requirements.

e VARD is delivering two ferries to the
Norwegian operator Torghatten Nord and
a dual-powered electric hybrid cruise ship
with icebreaker features, equipped with
high capacity batteries and LNG storage on
board;

e VARD will deliver the first electric self-
driving container ship in 2020. It will
gradually reduce human intervention over
the two years from delivery until reaching
complete autonomy in 2022. The 80-metre
by 15-metre vessel will operate in Norway,
guaranteeing a transport capacity of 120
TEU, replacing 40,000 TIR journeys a year.
The vessel will reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx)
and carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions and
improve road safety in a highly populated
urban area.
