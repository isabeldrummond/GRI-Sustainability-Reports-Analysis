ONGOING DIALOGUE

The Group’s focus on its relationships with
suppliers is constantly evolving. Therefore,
constant commitment and communication
are essential in order to help the Company
promote more positive and mutually
beneficial relationships. We believe that
close cooperation with the supply chain

is essential in order to achieve high levels
of quality in the finished product and in
the entire production process. With a view
to establishing a stable and long-lasting
relationship, based on transparency and
collaboration, we are actively committed
to promoting dialogue with our suppliers
through periodic meetings to share
information, including on sustainability.

During 2019, we organized our first
sustainability meeting with the participation
of 23 strategic suppliers.

Sustainability has steered these meetings,
during which topics such as the
Sustainability Plan and related objectives
were presented, with particular emphasis on
those concerning the supply chain.
Moreover, in order to increase our partners’
awareness of and involvement in social

and environmental issues, a fact-finding
questionnaire was sent out in 2019 toa
panel of 75 suppliers considered significant,

 

with the aim of studying the actions and
the governance model adopted. This
approach gives us greater awareness of
the certifications that suppliers possess
and the corporate procedures, policies and
management systems currently adopted by
suppliers, and enables us to follow a shared
path of sustainable development.
