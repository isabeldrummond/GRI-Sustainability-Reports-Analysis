CHARACTERISTICS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE
SUPPLY CHAIN OF FOREIGN COMPANIES

Fincantieri Marine Group: supply chain

Through Fincantieri Marine Group (FMG)

we are one of the leading manufacturers

of medium-sized ships in the United States
and we operate for civilian customers and
government agencies. The US Government
is the main customer of Fincantieri Marinette
Marine (FMM) and requires high quality, high
performance goods and services provided
by suppliers with proven experience

In order to fulfil the objectives of Congress,
the company supports small and medium
enterprises in selecting its suppliers, in
particular those run by women, economically
and socially disadvantaged individuals,
veterans, and companies that are part of
the Historically Underutilized Business Zone
Program (HUB zones). Founded in 1997,

the HUBZone Program aims to promote
economic development and employment
growth in disadvantaged areas, helping small
businesses located in these areas through
privileged access to opportunities in the
public procurement sector.

In 2019, 798 suppliers received a purchase
order from FMG, the majority of which are
situated in the United States.

With the exception of indirect purchases,
almost all purchases are managed directly
with the manufacturer, unless it is necessary
to go through an agent or there is a cost
advantage in resorting to a wholesaler or
distributor.

All suppliers working in the government
programme are required to sign a specific
Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and are
selected according to a specific procedure
for selection and evaluation which defines
the process and the methods to guarantee

the selection of suppliers based on criteria
of quality, technical capability, delivery times
and continuous improvement. The goal

is to select a supplier able to sustain the
programme, seeking the best compromise
in terms of price and quality, in order

to support the business and satisfy the
customer.

In accordance with the procedure adopted,
specific audits are carried out on suppliers,
which are also subjected to reassessments.
In particular, when a supplier does not
maintain the capabilities and qualities that
led to its enrolment in the register and
becomes critical to the FMM business, it is
expelled from the list of usable suppliers

In particular, 4 audits were carried out on
suppliers in 2019.

The purchase process is defined through
various procedures that describe all the
steps that must be followed to issue a
purchase order according to the needs of
FMM

Suppliers are selected according to various
criteria, starting from their experience in
the marine sector and their observance of
US law in social and environmental areas.
Other additional factors that are considered
include: estimated cost, purchase frequency,

size, position, shipowner’s recommendations,

recorded non-conformities, etc.

An orientation course is provided to
suppliers performing services in shipyards
before the works begin, to verify that they
meet certain insurance requirements. They
also carry out shipyard safety training
courses and are familiarized with the
correct contact representatives within the
company, in order to ensure an appropriate
communication flow.

The procedure followed for requests

for offers/quotations begins with the
development of a list of suppliers that are
able to guarantee the supply and meet all
the working, environmental and government
requirements as per terms and conditions
