In Italian sites the overall percentage of
waste sent for recovery over 2019 was about
75%.

The VARD group identifies the optimization
of recovery activities as a priority: in 2019,
waste sent for recovery amounted to about
90% of the total waste produced.

In the United States, Fincantieri Marine
Group has specific waste management
policies and procedures and aims to
continuously improve its waste management
processes. In 2019, thanks to the activities
implemented, the total waste produced had
fallen by 67% and 56% had been sent to
recovery.

Corporate mobility

Through corporate and local initiatives, we
promote a model of sustainable mobility
management that concretely affects

the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, leading to a change in established
habits with a greener perspective.

As envisaged in the Sustainability Plan, 2019
was the year of the launch of the company
digital car pooling service in Fincantieri
S.p.A. and in the Group’s Italian subsidiaries.
This service is designed to provide and
encourage an alternative sustainable solution

for home/work journeys by sharing the use
of personal cars. The system makes it easy
to for employees to get in touch with each
other, certify the results in terms of energy
and environmental savings and access a
reward system that encourages participation
in the initiative and helps to change
established habits. In parallel, an option

is being tested in the same digital system
to certify home/work journeys by bicycle
and on foot, and here too access a reward
system.

In 2019, the use of the car pooling service
certified a saving of 327,000 kilometres
travelled, corresponding to 42,683 kg of
carbon dioxide.

With the same aim, we have completed the
installation of electrical charging points at
all production sites and their use has been

made available to employees.

The agreement with the provider of welfare
services allows for the reimbursement of
season tickets issued for use on public
transport.

Company policy promotes the use of public
transport for work journeys whenever this
is possible and does not create excessive
difficulties for travel, thus avoiding recourse
to car use. We are also investing in new
technologies to reduce employees’ travel
for work, promoting the use of video and
teleconferencing.

In 2019, the Group’s employees made
business trips totalling over 67.6 million
