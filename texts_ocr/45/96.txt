the calculation method are indicated in

the relevant sections of the document. In
particular, with regard to the indicator of

the direct economic value generated and
distributed (201-1) in 2019, the method of
calculating the amounts allocated to the
community was revised in order to bring it
closer to the London Benchmarking Group
(LBG) model. It should be noted that with
regard to the raw materials indicator (301-1)
the 2018 data have been revised following the
inclusion of the VARD group data excluding
nitrogen and iron, the latter was provided only
for Fincantieri S.o.A. and Fincantieri Marine
Group for both 2018 and 2019. Fincantieri
Marine Group’s 2018 data for the procurement
of materials has been revised for comparative

 

purposes and as a result of improved
collection systems. Fincantieri Marine Systems
North America provided data for the first
year on employee journeys by air and by car.
As a result, indirect Scope 3 greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions (305-3) for both years were
also integrated with emissions from ferrous
materials and those for 2018 were revised
following the update of the data on raw
materials and material procurement data.
Fincantieri Marine Group’s 2018 data on
minority groups included in the indicator
(405-1) have been reclassified for comparison
purposes to adapt them to the definition that
is common to the whole Group.

With regard to the analysis and description of
the main indirect economic impacts associated
with outsourcing of the production chain
(203-2), Fincantieri has used an econometric
model developed by Censis (a Foundation
recognized with Decree of the President of the
Republic No. 712/1973). Based on this model,

a better estimate was produced to represent
the multiplier effects that Fincantieri is able to
produce within the national economic system,
based on the specific production and business
model developed and pursued in recent years
and the structure of the supply chain, with the
relative levels of integration upstream of the
production cycle for naval vessels.

The document was also the subject of a
limited assurance engagement according to
the criteria indicated in the revised ISAE 3000
standard involving the independent auditors
PwC S.p.A. who, at the end of their work,
issued the report required under Legislative
Decree 254/16 and Consob Regulation 20267
of 2019 concerning the compliance of the
information supplied in the Sustainability
Report - Consolidated Non-Financial
Statement prepared by Fincantieri under
Legislative Decree 254/16 and in accordance
with the reporting standard adopted.

The Sustainability Report is required to be
published annually. The document is also
available on the website (www-fincantieri.
com), in the Sustainability section.
