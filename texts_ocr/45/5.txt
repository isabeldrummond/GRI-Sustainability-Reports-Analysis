FINCANTIERI GROUP

Alongside this there is constant dedication
to the aspects of people's lives that are
most closely linked to work in Group
shipyards around the world. In September
the Palermo site also completed the
process for RINA to issue OHSAS 18001 and
ISO 14001 certificates of conformity, the
highest international standards of health
and safety at wor
protection: with this result the Company
arrived at full coverage of all the Group's
Italian production units. Looking overseas,
however, we cannot fail to mention the two
safety awards obtained by our Marinette
shipyard, which in 2019 received both the
“Excellence in Safety” and “Improvement

in Safety” awards from the Shipbuilding
Council of America.

Once again it is worth pointing out that
Fincantieri does not just see sustainability
as an opportunity, but as a real mission
to achieve and represent a model of
excellence.

In conclusion, we cannot fail to mention
the situation that we have all been facing
here for a few weeks now. Since the first
signs of the COVID-19 epidemiological
phenomenon, the Company has set up a
crisis committee to monitor and coordinate
the necessary actions. In this way we
were able to promptly implement all the
measures aimed at safeguarding the
health of all workers, through initiatives
in line with the indications given and the
measures progressively adopted by the
government, and often supplementing

them, as in the case of the stipulation of

an insurance cover specifically designed
for the COVID-19 health emergency, aimed
at all the employees of the Group’s Italian
companies and of the companies in the
supply network. In this context, Fincantieri
has currently suspended production
activities at Italian shipyards as of 16 March,
signing an agreement with the national
trade unions, the cornerstone of which

is to guarantee continuity of production
when they are resumed. Now, as is our
custom, we want to look to the future with
determination: we want to restart as soon
as possible, guaranteeing the health and
safety of our employees and those of the
companies in the supplier network while
maintaining the leadership, employment
levels and credibility that Fincantieri has
earned with its domestic and foreign
customers - fundamental elements not only
for Fincantieri and its system, but also for
the stability of the national economy. The
challenge ahead of us is very tough, but we
have emerged stronger from all the other
crises we have faced, and this time, despite
the most serious emergency since the
second post-war period, it will be the same
again.
