access with ramps, optical and acoustic
warning systems and devices that facilitate
mobility and therefore allowing all travellers
to enjoy the full range of services available
on board.

With regard to materials, the Company

has adopted an internal procedure on the
“Asbestos Free Declaration” which aims

to ensure that the products produced are
free of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and ozone depleting substances
(ODS). The procedure also defines the
components, structures and equipment
that require the Declaration by suppliers. In
addition, with regard to the management
of chemical products, suppliers must
declare and ensure that their products and
services are developed using only materials
and substances that are not prohibited by
applicable laws and regulations and that are
not classified as mutagenic or carcinogenic.
In the last phase of the ship’s construction,
dedicated sessions are held to enable the

crew to familiarize themselves with the on-
board systems, particularly those relating
to safety, before the ship enters service. In
general, education and training is provided
directly by the suppliers of the different
systems.

In naval shipbuilding, we are one of the few
operators able to design and build a wide
and complete product portfolio that includes
surface combat vessels, auxiliary and
specialized vessels, as well as submarines.
Our ships are equipped with state-of-the-art
command and control systems. Although
the Group assembles and installs armaments
supplied by third parties in the process of
building and equipping its naval vessels
according to the customer’s instructions, the
Group has never manufactured and does
not manufacture armaments or weapon
components itself.

As part of the general concept of the

naval vessel’s survivability, studies are

being carried out to further reduce its
vulnerability to cyber attacks. In addition, an
observatory has been set up to screen laws
and regulations relating to environmental
aspects, chemical risk and health and safety
at work, with the aim of making the already
established contractual requirements
complementary to the current regulatory
situation

For each ship, the residual risk assessment
document as provided for by Legislative
Decree 81/2008 is delivered to the ship’s
captain

 

Systems to improve air quality have been
introduced for the well-being of the crew
and, where it has been possible to increase
the well-being of the crew compatibly
with the vessel’s operational profiles,

the following improvements have been
introduced:

e increased air changes per hour for the
heating, ventilation and air conditioning
CHVAC) system;

e increased fresh air supply for each air
change per hour for the HVAC system;

e extension of HVAC in some operational
areas (e.g. hangar);

¢ increased liveability of the areas intended
for the crew by ensuring more square
metres per person, introducing modular
cabins with attached integrated toilet/
shower unit and partitions to cut noise
pollution;

e use of water-based paints for interior areas.

The renewal process for the Italian Navy fleet
has a distinctly dual approach, typical of the
Armed Forces. The Navy is often engaged in
non-military tasks such as aiding populations
affected by natural disasters, monitoring

and protecting archaeological heritage,

and transporting humanitarian materials

and basic necessities, which is influencing
the current use of the fleet and the way in
which the renewal process is taking place
The new constructions are designed right

from the preliminary phase of the project to
be flexible, modular and reliable, with low
environmental impact, easily reconfigurable
and upgradable

In the event of an operation to support
populations affected by a natural disaster,
the new vessels will be able to provide
drinking water, electricity and health
support through its own hospital facilities. In
addition to the particular attention giving to
reducing emissions of fumes, the treatment
of wastewater and the use of bio-fuels,

the vessels will be able to intervene to
contain a contaminated tract of sea, with
the possibility of collecting and stowing the
polluting substances

Consolidating the experience gained on the
projects for the Italian Navy, the logistics
ship for the Qatari Navy (LPD Qatar) is
being developed, where the concepts of
flexibility, modularity and low environmental
impact have been enhanced. The new vessel
can also be used for humanitarian purposes
in crisis areas both in times of peace and in
times of war.

Lastly, the International Convention for

the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
(MARPOL) aims to prevent and minimize
pollution from ships, whether accidental
pollution or pollution resulting from

routine operations. We are committed to
various projects with the aim of containing
environmental impact throughout the ship’s
life cycle.
