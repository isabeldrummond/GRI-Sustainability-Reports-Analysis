The processes for treating, sorting and
disposing of the waste produced on board are
shown in the diagram below.

WASTE TREATMENT

- collection, dehumidification, kitchen waste
treatment;

- sorting and recycling of hotel waste;

- compaction and/or incineration (where
permitted) of solid waste;

 

- pelletizing, storage of waste for
subsequent unloading in port.

Ballast water treatment

The ballast water treatment regulations,
International Convention for the Control and
Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and
Sediments (BWM 2004), require ships to
sterilize ballast water before discharging it,
to avoid contamination with species from
different ecosystems.

BALLAST WATER TREATMENT

Latest generation of ballast water treatment
systems, based on the pre-filtering of
plankton and subsequent sterilization with
ultraviolet rays.

 

 

 

 

- physical and biological treatment Cin line
with the best land standards) of all on-board
wastewater (sewage, grey water, kitchen
effluents and laundries);

- storage of purified water;

- thickening and drying of residual sludge for
subsequent unloading in port.

Although the disposal of materials at the

end of the ship’s operational life is not part
of the ship’s construction activities because
it is managed directly by the shipowners,
cruise ships built by Fincantieri have voluntary
certifications such as Green Passport, Clean
Ship or Eco (the name of the certification

is different depending on the classification
society). These certifications include our
commitment to provide, on delivery of

the ship, the list of hazardous materials in
accordance with the Hong Kong Convention
for the safe and environmentally friendly
recycling of ships, adopted by IMO’s MEPC
197 (62). The classification society will

carry out periodic audits throughout the

life of the ship to ensure compliance with
environmental standards and maintenance of
its environmental certification.

 

Naval vessels

The naval vessel construction business is
strongly influenced by the continual demand
to increase efficiency standards in the
international defense segment and is one

of the most demanding challenges. We are
a reference player for many Navies and we
face tough challenges with our consolidated
experience in the design sector; since 1990,
Fincantieri has delivered over 100 naval
vessels to ten different nations.

Its consolidated experience has enabled it
to combine the development of platforms
with high operational performance with
the development of solutions aimed at
containing environmental impacts.

Thanks to the adoption of an eco-sustainable
design process and the increased sensitivity
owards ecological issues shown by Navies,
we have been able to operate in many

ields, adopting solutions aimed at reducing
environmental impact. We have collaborated
with the Italian Navy for many years,
ocusing on environmental impact issues
right from the preliminary project. The new
vessels, some of which are already in service,
eature design choices aimed at containing
environmental impact in terms of emissions
0 air, fuel consumption, wastewater
reatment, use of special treatments to
preserve the hull and the possibility, for
certain vessels to be delivered shortly, to
contain an area of sea that is polluted, with
he possibility of collecting and storing the
pollutants on board.

As regards power generation, building

 

on more than ten years of experience of

FINCANTIERI GROUP e

submarines, studies are underway for the
use of fuel cells on naval vessels.

Energy saving and reduction of emissions

This issue is dealt with by introducing
energy savings criteria developed mainly

in ship architecture, namely by selecting
endothermic engines (both propulsion
engines and power generation engines) with
appropriate technological solutions and by
selecting high energy efficiency materials or
materials with high efficiency heat transfer.

On the other hand, the special characteristics
of naval vessels and the consequent system
solutions optimized to deliver mission
performance currently do not enable the
introduction of energy recovery systems.
