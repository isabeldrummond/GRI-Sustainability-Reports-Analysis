Code of Conduct

All those who work for Fincantieri, without
exception or distinction, are committed to
observing and ensuring the observance of the
company’s Code of Conduct, which, for the
smooth operation, reliability and reputation
of the Group, requires that all the activities
are conducted in compliance with the law,
with international conventions and in strict
accordance with the human rights enshrined in
the UN Universal Declaration.

Operating according to the principle of fair
competition, with honesty, integrity, fairness
and good faith, respecting the legitimate
interests of our stakeholders, shareholders,
employees, customers, commercial and
financial partners and of the general public
and local communities in which we conduct
our activities is fundamental for the smooth
operation, reliability and reputation of the
Group, but at the same time represents a key
asset for Fincantieri’s ongoing success. In

no way does the conviction of acting in the
interest or advantage of the Company justify
adopting conduct that goes against these
principles and all conduct contrary to the
words or spirit of the Code will be subject to
sanctions as mentioned in the Code.

We are committed to encouraging and
promoting knowledge of the Code among
employees and with all parties who have
business relations with Fincantieri and we
monitor observation of the Code, providing
suitable tools for information, prevention and
control, and ensuring the transparency of
existing operations and conduct.

The Board of Directors and the Company
management is responsible for verifying

the Code of Conduct’s implementation and

Anti-corruption Policy

Given the extensive geographic context in
which we operate, the Company has adopted

a number of internal rules aimed at identifying
and applying a global anti-corruption policy
that defines the expectations for conducting
business operations in strict compliance with
the best international standards on anti-
corruption legislation. The Group’s commitment
to combating corruption - established in primis
by the Code of Conduct - is reflected in a series
