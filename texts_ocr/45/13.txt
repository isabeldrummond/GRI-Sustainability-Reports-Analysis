@ FINCANTIERI GROUP

Who are our stakeholders?

We consider listening to and involving

our stakeholders is paramount in order to
understand their needs, their interests and
their expectations. Stakeholders’ involvement
allows us to develop long-term relationships
which become a source of competitive
advantage for our Group.

In 2017, we analysed and identified the main
categories of stakeholders, both within

and outside the Group. More specifically,
consideration was given to those stakeholders
towards whom Fincantieri has responsibilities
and those persons or entities able to influence
the Group’s performance; their level of
representativeness and authoritativeness have
also been considered.
