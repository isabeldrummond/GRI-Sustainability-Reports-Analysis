the introduction and use
of situational awareness
concepts in the maritime
environment. The project
envisages the cooperation
of over 40 international
partners.

Integrated Bridge (SeaQ
Bridge): this innovative
solution allows the
integration of a wide
selection of navigation and
communication solutions
in a system controllable
from the vessel’s bridge.
This allows a considerable
simplification of on-
board operations anda
consequent increase in
security.

Cyber: project funded by
the Liguria region and
aimed at studying different
cyber security aspects for
critical infrastructures.
STESS - Systems and
technologies to improve
after sales services: the
project, financed by

the Italian Ministry for

Economic Development,
aims to develop prototype
technologies, guidelines and
processes that, in the future,
will enable the offer and
delivery of an overall after-
sales service bundled with
Fincantieri products.

ECHO - European network
of Cybersecurity centres
and competence Hub for
innovation and Operations:
project, funded under the
Horizon 2020 programme,
aimed at developing a
coordinated and structured
approach to proactively
increase the EU’s cyber
defence through efficient
transectorial partnerships.
FLARE - FLooding Accident
REsponse: cooperative
project, funded under the
Horizon 2020 programme,
which aims to develop a
methodology based on

risk analysis to assess and
control the risk of flooding
in real time on board
passenger ships.

 

¢ SAFEMODE - Strengthening
synergies between Aviation
and maritime in the area

of human Factors towards
achieving more Efficient
and resilient MODEs of
transportation: the project,
funded under the Horizon
2020 programme, aims

to develop a new design
framework for “HUman Risk
Informed Design” (HURID)
in order to identify, collect
and assess human factor
data in order to provide
properly risk-based systems
deisgn and operative
procedures.

Smart Cabin (v2.0): the
project, financed internally
by the subsidiary VARD,
aims to expand the
knowledge base in the field
of home automation in
order to increase perceived
quality and improve the
onboard experience of
passengers.

Smart
Yard eo

 

We have set ourselves several
development objectives

as regards safety and
productivity at work with

a view to improving all the
design and construction
phases in the shipyard. The
introduction and application
of innovative computer
models, logistics and quality
control procedures in line
with Industry 4.0 guidelines
will drive the evolution of the
shipyards of the future. This
area has also given rise to
studies and developments
related to the cyber security
aspects of production
processes, with particular
emphasis on the security

of Information Technology
(IT) infrastructures and the
OT infrastructures of the
shipyards (linked to the world
of Operational Technology,
such as, for example, the
networks that control
automatic machines), with a

 

 

pilot project started as part
of the production process
innovation project at the
Marghera site. In the years
to come, the aim will be to
follow a ship throughout its
entire life cycle, including
trying to facilitate the last
phase - decommissioning -
studying new welding and
joining procedures. The main
projects active and related to
these issues are:

¢ RAMSSES - Realisation and
Demonstration of Advanced
Material Solutions for
Sustainable and Efficient

Ships: a cooperation project,

funded under the Horizon
2020 programme, that aims
to widen the application of
advanced materials in the
European maritime industry
by also carefully studying
aspects related to industrial
methods. In particular, the
project sets out to analyse
the different applications
of high-strength steel and
composites on board.

 

 

 

¢ Marghera shipyard

production process
innovation: a project,
inanced by the Italian
inistry of Economic
Development, aimed at
achieving the requirements
or yards and infrastructure
or the construction of
arge ship sections in the
arghera shipyard by
reviewing the layout and the
oroduction process.

¢ Monfalcone shipyard

production process
innovation: the project,
inanced by the Italian
inistry of Economic
Development, has the
strategic goal to innovate

 

he production process of
cruise ships, focusing on
increasing the efficiency
and quality of the mounting
and outfitting of the
sections to significantly
reduce dry-dock lead times.
