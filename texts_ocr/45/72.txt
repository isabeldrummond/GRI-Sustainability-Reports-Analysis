FINCANTIERI GROUP

Employees are guaranteed freedom of
association throughout the Group. In 2019,
52% of employees are registered with trade
unions.

The VARD group has established a model of
industrial relations that is strongly oriented
towards dialogue with trade unions in
order to identify and provide impetus for
the changes needed to ensure a stable

and profitable future for the Company.
During 2019, especially in the Norwegian
shipyards, agreements and protocols were
signed to define phases, rules and timing
for the gradual cessation of VARD activities
at the Aukra and Brevik shipyards and to
manage the personnel concerned through
redeployments or support in the search for
new opportunities. Trade union agreements
have been signed at the VARD shipyards

in Braila and Tulcea in Romania to improve
productivity (reorganization of work
programmes, shift changes, breaks), with the
simultaneous introduction, in terms of pay,
of a bonus system focused on results.

Remuneration

PERSONNEL COSTS

 

The remuneration of employees (blue collar
and white collar) is defined in relation to

the relevant labour market and with the
provisions of the collective bargaining
agreements and company level contracts and
consists of a fixed component and a variable
component

The fixed component remunerates the role
and, specifically, the responsibilities assigned
to each employee, taking account of,

among other things, the level of experience
the quality of the contribution that each
employee brings to the attainment of the
business results, as well as the level of
excellence with respect to the duties assigned
and is sufficient to remunerate the services
performed in the event of no payment or only
partial payment of the variable components,
where envisaged

tis also such as to ensure a suitably
competitive position with respect to the level
of salary paid by the market for the specific
position.

The variable component is linked to
predetermined and measurable Group
and individual performance objectives and
remunerates, according to the different

 

structures, the results achieved in the short
and long term. The latter, moreover, focuses
people’s attention and commitment on the
achievement of strategic objectives and can

be provided not only in monetary form, but
also in the form of welfare or non-monetary
benefits
