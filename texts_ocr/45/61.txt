ONGOING DIALOGUE

The shipbuilding sector is constantly
developing, which is why in order to
create products that are increasingly safe,
sustainable, efficient and have a lower
environmental impact, it is important to
create long-term relationships with all

the stakeholders involved in the process.
Therefore, we are in constant dialogue and
cooperation with:

¢ shipowning companies, which intercept
the new needs of end customers

(cruise passengers) and promote the
development of the market in terms of
products and services. We constantly
listen to the needs of the shipowner,
building each ship according to their
specifications. By nature, the entire
shipbuilding process requires a continuous
relationship between the Project Manager,
the customer and their staff;

the bodies issuing the regulations,
whether national or private, which
monitor ship operations and update

the regulations to prevent damage and
accidents;

suppliers that develop and make

available new products and systems

for new constructions based on market
requirements.

 

Our challenge is to integrate and unify the
demands of these industry players in the
most effective way and to combine the
design, safety and sustainability of our
ships in the optimal way.

In order to maintain constant contacts,
we are also committed to collaborating
with the various stakeholders (shipowning
companies, agencies, suppliers) through
working parties, one-to-one meetings,
video and tele-conferencing.

An important opportunity for dialogue
with customers and potential customers
is participation in exhibitions. This is

an essential activity for the Group as it
provides direct contact with customers,
reinforces the consolidation of the brand

 

in the reference markets and can be an
opportunity to communicate the launch of
new products. Fincantieri took part in 25
exhibitions in 2019.
