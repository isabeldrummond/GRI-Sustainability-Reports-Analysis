OUR COMMITMENT TO HEALTH AND SAFETY

Safety at work, workers’ health, the
maintenance and improvement of work
environments have always been our main
drivers and the foundation of our policies, in
a vision that considers safety a strategic and
development factor for the Company.

The continued implementation of tools
associated with the certification of

the company's systems for managing
health and safety at work, according to
the requirements of OHSAS 18001/ISO
45001, has resulted in the broadening of
the work population involved, facilitating
dissemination of corporate culture growth
paths.

This result is monitored through the
systematic implementation of internal
audits connected to the certification of
management systems and it has been
further supported by the various actions
implemented as part of the Towards Zero
Accidents project.

Towards Zero Accidents

For several years the Towards Zero
Accidents project has involved all the
resources concerned with the Company’s
production process within a structured plan
of initiatives and it has continued along its
path of activities aimed at employees and
suppliers and at contractors’ employees.

To consolidate good practices and the
constant monitoring of the production
dynamics, coordination meetings on safety
and the environment are organized which,
scheduled at least every two weeks, are
carried out directly in the production areas

workers’ safety representatives.

Furthermore, the meetings of the Quality
and Safety Committees are held periodically
in each production unit. These committees,
composed of the site Management and the
people reporting to management, including
he quality, health, safety and environment
managers, have the aim of supervising and
monitoring production processes during

heir constant evolution and within their
different complexities. In these committees,
workers’ requests and any critical elements
hat may have emerged during joint
inspections of the operational areas or within
he Commission for Safety and Environment
have a prompt and timely response.

Similarly, in the United States, the Fincantieri
arine Group organizes monthly meetings
between health & safety and environment
managers and union representatives to
analyse and share the results of accident
analyses, performance indicators and the
main updates to the safety management
system.

 

The trend in injury data and rates for
employees and contractors is constantly
monitored, both at company and site level,
and a special monthly report informs Top
Management, all employers and all the
health and safety managers. Similarly, with
the aim of involving and informing the entire
company audience with view to prevention,
the documented analyses of accidents

and near misses at individual shipyards

are systematically shared in a particularly
