The Policy was developed with the
involvement of Group companies, under
the coordination of the Human Resources
departments and in close collaboration

with the main corporate functions. This
comprehensive involvement has made it
possible to carry out an exhaustive mapping
of the initiatives and best practices in place
in the various companies within the countries
in which the Group operates. In fact, a study
of the reference context was carried out in

parallel to identify the regulatory scenario,
standards, the main trends and any risks
present. Using the results of the assessment
and benchmark carried out with a number of
significant players, the areas of intervention
have been defined and the Policy has been
drawn up, which will be followed by a work
plan for effective implementation and
monitoring capable of overseeing the logic
of continuous improvement.

Even in countries like Vietnam, where
human rights might be more at risk, the
Company constantly monitors these issues.
The Vietnamese shipyard has been certified
in compliance with SA 8000. The model
guarantees a virtuous process aimed at

ensuring their continuous respect and
provides specific training to all new recruits.
In 2019, 1,861 hours of human rights training
were provided in the Vietnamese shipyard
with the participation of 267 people.
