test smart working for particular personal
situations.

The Company’s focus on work-life balance,
which is already included in the National
Collective Bargaining Agreement for
steelworkers where a worker dealing with
serious family situations can take a period
of leave of absence of up to two years, has
also been implemented indirectly with the
involvement of company clubs, through
initiatives that meet the employees’ needs:
special arrangements with day care centres,
seaside or mountain resorts during the
summer, daytime summer camps and after-
school activities.

With regard to supplementary health care,
since January 2018 the Company has been a

member of the Health Fund for steelworkers,

called “MétaSalute”, with a supplementary
health care plan for employees and
dependent family members, also covered
free of charge. Health services are provided
both directly, through the facilities
contracted by the operator and in the form
of reimbursement.

The Fincantieri agreement on health

care also confirmed the opportunity for
pensioners, under the most favourable
conditions, to continue to make use of the
supplementary health care benefits with a
contribution paid for by them.

Fincantieri Marine Group provides benefits
to all employees working for at least 30
hours a week. Benefits include subscription
to the Group Health Medical Plan, which
covers various services: a medical coverage
plan, a dental coverage plan and vision

coverage plan for eye health. The costs are
borne partly by the Company and partly by
the worker. Additional benefits are available
that are not included in the above plans,
such as the on-site clinic, vacation and
holiday pay, the policy on short/long term
disability, life insurance for accidental death
& dismemberment, the retirement plan and
the employee assistance programme.

The VARD group provides its employees,
using different methods depending on the
location, with medical assistance, internal
catering services, food cards, training
incentives and support for transport to and
from home.

Industrial relations

Industrial relations in Fincantieri are
characterized by a participatory model
that is developed through the activities of
various commissions defined by the 2016
supplementary labour agreement, which
in some cases, in addition to trade unions,
include workers.

A strategically important body is the
Advisory Committee, composed of

12 members, 6 of which are company
representatives and 6 trade unions,

which meets annually for information and
consultation between the Parties on issues
such as market scenarios and competitive
positioning, economic performance,
alliances and strategic partnerships, business
strategies, technological innovations, safety
at work, training and retraining, relations with
educational institutions and/or universities,

and employment trends.

The Committee also meets when there are
changes in the company and ownership
structure, significant organizational
changes, significant changes in labour
policy, restructuring and/or reorganization
projects and restructuring and development
programmes.

In fact, any restructuring and/or
reorganization processes provide for specific
information procedures with the involvement
of trade unions, in order to identify the most
appropriate tools (e.g. early retirement,
reduction of working hours, social shock
absorbers, retraining, etc.) and their different
structuring according to the different
contexts.

The supplementary agreement also

governs the operation of the Joint National
Committee on Safety at Work and the Joint
National Training Committee. Composed of
3 company representatives and 3 workers’
representatives, these joint committees are
responsible for analysing the characteristics
and trends of the issues within internal
evolution, verifying the consistency of

the initiatives implemented, proposing

and evaluating new general or specialized
initiatives, and evaluating and approving
intervention plans.

Each company site has a Bilateral Joint
Technical Body and a Committee on Safety
and Environment. Their purpose is, by
systematically involving all resources, to
increase the motivation and participation

of employees in the change and innovation

FINCANTIERI GROUP e

processes, combining the necessary
increases in efficiency and productivity with
the improvement of working conditions and
the environment.

With regard to the subjective right to
continuous training, Fincantieri operates

in line with the provisions of the National
Collective Bargaining Agreement signed

in 2016, guaranteeing the possibility of
participating, either directly or at the initiative
of the Company, in training courses lasting

at least 24 hours per person during the three
years of the National Collective Bargaining
Agreement.

This approach has provided yet more
impetus to the training process, which is
already effectively monitored, helping to
further awareness of the need for companies
and workers to invest in the continuous
updating of skills and knowledge, identified
as strategic factors when responding to
technological, organizational and market
changes.

 

In relation to the growing process of
internationalization and with a view to
encouraging the full involvement of Group
workers, Fincantieri, together with the

trade unions, is committed to setting up a
special working group for the establishment
of the European Works Council (EWC),

the purpose of which will be to inform and
consult the workers of EU-wide companies.

 

The current supplementary labour agreement
will also be fully effective in 2020, since

the trade union agreement providing for its
extension was signed in December 2019.
