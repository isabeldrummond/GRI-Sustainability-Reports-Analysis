@ FINCANTIERI GROUP

We are committed to implementing and
maintaining our management systems

in particular; all the production sites of
Fincantieri S.p.A., the US Marinette site, as
well as the Braila and Tulcea shipyards in
Romania and Vung Tau in Vietnam of the
VARD group are certified ISO 14001:2015.

Environmental audits are carried out
regularly in all the sites by the specific
internal structures and all the reports of any
environmental accidents are collected and
managed systematically.

The individual certified sites adopt specific
site policies consistent with the guidelines
defined at company level. The latter are
binding for all Fincantieri employees and are
shared with all suppliers through frequent
coordination activities.

oe For more information on the certified shipyards and
wa companies, see the website

www.fincantieri.com/en/sustainability/certifications

As part of the management systems,

the individual production units plan
specific training/information activities on
environmental issues on an annual basis,
based on identified needs, to increase the
level of knowledge and raise awareness of
their employees on individual issues.

During 2019, in accordance with the
objective of the Sustainability Plan, we
committed ourselves to spreading and
promoting the culture of environmental
sustainability by launching a communication
campaign (for a “sustainable” office), within
the Fincantieri for the Green Future project,
that is focused on promoting virtuous and
eco-sustainable behaviour.

The objectives of the campaign are to:

* consolidate the culture of sustainability
and the virtuous path that the Group has
undertaken in terms of environmental
protection, giving practical form to the
objectives published in the Sustainability
Plan;

¢ disseminate projects and strategies aimed
at reducing environmental impact to all
stakeholders by first involving employees,

but also suppliers, in the sustainability path;

* create greater awareness and sensitivity in
order to encourage all employees to make
a tangible contribution to safeguarding the
environment with virtuous behaviours in
day-to-day life, both at work and at home.

The campaign was launched by distributing
a brochure to all employees that illustrates
the virtuous behaviour to be adopted in
everyday life, both in the workplace and at
home, and with the symbolic distribution
of a gadget (an aluminium water bottle to
encourage people to reduce their plastic
consumption).

The subsidiary Insis has also promoted an
internal campaign on lighting management
and a policy on reusing materials.

Environmental aspects

We are bound by laws and regulations

to protect the environment and people’s
health which impose limits on atmospheric
emissions, discharges into water and soil
and set rules for the treatment of hazardous
waste and the reclamation of any polluted
sites.

No significant environmental accidents
occurred in the Group’s production sites in
2019.

Energy

The Parent Company produces an energy
diagnosis each year (in 2019 with reference
to consumption in 2018), in compliance with
the regulatory requirements of Legislative
Decree 102/2014, aimed at identifying
inefficiencies and implementing an annual
programme to modernize the plants,
including through the implementation of
new technologies capable of guaranteeing
ever better performance in terms of energy
efficiency.

To make the quality of data acquired

more reliable and identify the consequent
improvement actions, the installation of
more advanced measurement systems has
continued, giving priority to those for the
most significant energy consumption and
which are more easily dealt with from a
performance perspective. The process of
improving the energy efficiency of lighting
systems, carried out with the gradual
installation of solutions based on LED
technology, continued. During 2019, this
intervention involved the Castellammare

di Stabia, Monfalcone, Palermo and Sestri
Ponente shipyards in Italy, the Braila shipyard
in Romania, the Marinette shipyard in the
United States and the subsidiary lsotta
Fraschini Motori’s production site in Bari.

 

 

The good results from the Ancona shipyard
regarding the experimental introduction of
a remote control and automatic shutdown
system for the mobile welding fume
extractors has validated the initiative, which
is expected to be implemented in 2020

at the Marghera, Monfalcone and Sestri
Ponente shipyards.
