Supplier qualification process

Development and efficiency of our
supply chain start immediately at the
supplier selection phase, which follows
a documented procedure in order

to guarantee impartiality and equal
opportunities for all the parties involved.

Management and the continuous
improvement of a pool of trusted and
innovative suppliers is essential in order to
achieve the goals we have set for ourselves
at Group level in economic and sustainability
terms. Fincantieri’s purchasing office
provides suppliers with constant technical
support for all activities related to the
selection and qualification process, including
those concerning sustainability. Fincantieri
recognises that the supplier base is a
significant asset for the entire company, and
as such it should be valued and protected.
This is why we have developed a stringent
qualification and performance monitoring
process for strategic suppliers, based on

the evaluation of economic, technical,
reputational, social and environmental
aspects.

In this sense, the collection of
environmental and social information is
active during the pre-qualification stage, e.g.
possession of environmental, health, work
safety and social responsibility certifications.

HOW WE MONITOR THEM

A stringent performance monitoring process
is carried out so that suppliers can maintain
their qualified status and to promptly
manage any critical issues.

A supplier remains qualified as long as the
reasons for its inclusion in the Register of
Suppliers continue to exist and until the
monitoring of its performance is considered
critical to the point of expulsion.

We monitor the supply chain using a life
cycle management approach to reduce

the environmental and social impact of a
product or service over its entire lifetime

to a minimum. In particular, sensitivity
towards and respect for the environment is
spread along the whole production chain,
and this has led to increasing exchanges of
information and documents with suppliers.

As part of the supplier monitoring system,
we use a continuous performance evaluation
system, in which all the relevant corporate
departments take part (balanced scorecard),
in order to guarantee that the required
standards are met over time. Through the
use of specific purchase methods adapted
for the different product categories, we are
committed to obtaining the best conditions
and performance throughout the entire life
cycle of the product.
