An analysis of the policy documents
produced by international organizations,
research centres and, more generally, by our
stakeholders, allows us to define the areas
which have not yet been explored and where
the Group’s resources can be invested.

As regards the medium and short term,
our commitment is aimed at satisfying
both the requests we expect to receive in
order to meet the needs of the end users
of the product and those actually received
from shipowners. In the first case, we are
committed to off-the-shelf innovation,

i.e. those activities that are not directly
applicable to orders, but are strategic in

anticipating the needs of the end customers
for our product. The directions to be taken
suggested by recent market surveys show
the importance of concentrating our efforts
on issues such as energy efficiency and
reduction of operating costs, maximization
of payload and at the same time perceived
quality, and improvement of safety. In the
shorter term, however, the focus is on
developing and innovating technologies
and applying them to each individual

order. Timely fulfilment of the shipowner’s
requests often requires the development

of technological solutions or the study of
innovative materials and systems to be
applied during the ship design phase.

R&l plan © ™

Fincantieri draws up a Research and
Innovation Plan (R&I Plan) every year.

The Plan is the tool that the Group uses to
effectively implement its strategy and it

is the cornerstone of the other processes
in Research and Innovation. The annual
redefinition of the projects is essential in
order to maintain consistency between the
activities carried out during the previous
year, new corporate objectives and the
market needs envisaged in the near future.

The plan takes its momentum from the
processes analysing technological and

economic megatrends, carried out by our
analysts or sector stakeholders, as part

of the process of defining the Group’s
development strategy. The innovation with
suppliers process also contributes to the
plan. This process is dedicated to analysing
the specific perspective of the partners
operating upstream in the value chain - in
order to define joint development roadmaps
that enable the Group and its ecosystem
of suppliers of components and related
subsystems to achieve joint objectives.

The plan is also fuelled by the Technology
Scouting process which aims to analyse
emerging technologies in detail, including
in sectors far removed from the world of
shipping, and assess their potential impact
on our products, services and processes.
