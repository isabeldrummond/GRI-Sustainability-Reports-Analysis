detailed format, which is sent electronically.
The same data, together with other health,
safety and environmental (HSE) issues,

are compared and examined at quarterly
meetings involving all site managers on
health and safety at work issues. In the
same context, the corporate HR manager
coordinates work to share best practices,
raise issues of common interest and identify
improvement proposals on which to involve
and direct the Group’s activities.

Particular importance is attached, within
the mechanisms governing variable

pay, to objectives related to health and
safety at work and environmental issues.
The company’s best performance and
sustainability improvement objectives are
benchmarks used to monitor and stimulate
the performance result and determine the
related economic impact.

Evidence of work-related stress risk has
been the subject of targeted pathways
involving employees and workers’ safety
representatives in identifying possible
sources of risk. Surveys and tests carried
out individually and for homogeneous
groups allow the Company to acquire results
and elements which are used to define,
where necessary, appropriate initiatives
with a view to reducing risk and promoting
personal well-being (training, organizational

measures, etc.). This type of risk, together
with all the specific risks present in the
workplace, is addressed in the safety courses
for employees regardless of their position.
The risk assessment process, in particular
those related to health and safety at work, is
the subject of specific company guidelines
and subsequent operating procedures.

The VARD subsidiary, similarly to Towards
Zero Accidents, continues to implement its
Vision Zero project, the results of which
confirm a positive trend.

Further initiatives have been implemented
with the aim of preventing any type of
accident to people and the environment:

* using the Safety Observation tool to report
any anomalies found;

* reporting health and safety indicators at
the monthly management meetings;

* organization of an internal accident
prevention week;

* monthly discussions on health and safety
(required by law in Brazil);

* electing an internal commission for the
prevention of accidents;

* the internal distribution, based on the
Group’s guidelines, of a booklet with the
ten golden rules for health and safety at
work.

 

The US subsidiaries have maintained a high
commitment to safety and the environment
and have received numerous awards for

Marine won the Safety Excellence Award
