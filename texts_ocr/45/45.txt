Awareness of the supply chain’s strategic
nature and the need to coordinate a vast and
varied network of suppliers means it is essential
‘o seek long-term partner relationships that

are based on transparency, collaboration and
mutual respect.

n this sense, it is extremely important that
suppliers respect the Code of Conduct that the
Company has implemented, which contains the
orinciples and rules that must be observed.

n order to strengthen the bond with our
suppliers, in 2019 we drew up the Suppliers’
Code of Ethics, approved by the Board of
Directors. This document is intended to convey
he values, principles and responsibilities
defined by our Code of Conduct, Charter of
Sustainability Commitments and Sustainability
Plan. It has been defined based on national and
international best practices and principles. The
document was developed by the Procurement
Department with the involvement of various
corporate functions (Sustainability, Human
Resources, Internal Auditing, Legal Affairs) and
was shared with Italian and foreign subsidiaries.
The Code is based on three fundamental pillars:

as The Suppliers’ Code of Conduct is available on the website
www-fincantieri.com/globalassets/sostenibilita2/responsabilita-
economica/fincantieri_suppliers_code_of_ethics2.pdf

Suppliers are required to adhere to the Code
of Ethics and to share it with their employees,
subsidiaries, collaborators and subcontractors,
as well as to monitor compliance with it and
to report promptly any alleged or actual
violations of the law, the Suppliers’ Code of
Ethics, the Organization, Management and
Control Model pursuant to Legislative Decree
231/200), or any contractual agreement with
the Company.

The importance of the relationship with
suppliers is underlined by the fact that our
product is highly customized, since it is
designed and engineered to the specific
needs of the individual customer.

This entails active management of make-
or-buy procurement strategies during
every single phase of development and
implementation of the naval job, while
maintaining constant synergy with its
suppliers in the continuous search for high
value added solutions.
