@ FINCANTIERI GROUP

As regards monitoring of corruption cases,
it should be noted that no confirmed cases
of corruption involved companies in the
Fincantieri Group were found in 2018 and
2019.

National Framework Tender Protocol

Having identified in the tender system a key
element for our ability to develop and raise
our competitive standing in our reference
markets, we have always paid constant
attention, also in this context, to ensuring
maximum transparency.

It is in fact in the interest of the Company
to ensure respect for legality and to defend
the market from interference by organized
crime, as well as from undue interference
and pressures from common criminals,
preventing any possible infiltration attempt
by organized crime during the process of
awarding tenders, in capital expenditure and
in production activities.

To this end, since 1999, Fincantieri has been
working on improved cooperation with the
relevant local authorities and, over time, has
arrived at signing Legality and Transparency
Protocols, which led to the signing of

a single National Framework Tender
Protocol with the Ministry of the Interior

on 27 February 2017, aimed at preventing
infiltration attempts by organized crime.
The agreement represents a fundamental
milestone that unifies the procedures

for control against organized crime ona
national level in companies considered at
“high risk” and which enabled, since its
activation, more than 2,200 reports to be
sent to the relevant local Prefectures on
firms that operate on contracts and sub-
contracts in all locations of the Fincantieri
Group.

The agreement, in addition to having set up
a permanent round table in the Minister’s
Office, guarantees an invaluable exchange
of information for those cases considered
most at high risk and, should any issues
arise, enables Fincantieri to adopt the most
appropriate protective measures while also
reconciling the necessary confidentiality
requirements of the parties involved.
Under the agreement, Fincantieri also asks
the supply chain concerned to ensure the
highest levels of transparency and fairness
and fulfil their obligations to combat
against and report any instances that
could entail conspiracy to commit a crime
- including mafia-type conspiracy - or, by
way of example, corruption, fraud, money
laundering and extortion.

WE RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS

We are committed to ensuring and
promoting respect for human rights, a
priority for the Group, in all business areas
and among all stakeholders, whether Group
employees or suppliers. We conduct our
activities in accordance with fundamental
human rights standards.

As proof of this commitment, our policies
and practices are aligned with:

e International Bill of Human Rights,
including the United Nations (UN)
Universal Declaration on Human Rights;

e Fundamental Conventions of the
International Labor Organization (ILO);

¢ Guidelines of the Organization for
Economic Co-Operation and Development
(OECD) for Multinational Enterprises;

e Ten principles of the United Nations Global
Compact.

The Group has adopted the Policy On
Human Rights - Commitment for the
respect of human rights and diversity

and the Suppliers’ Code of Ethics, two
relevant documents to guide the company’s
activities, following an approach to business
that is not limited to compliance with the
regulations in force in the countries where
we operate, but proactively oriented towards
the protection of human rights.

The documents approved by the Board

of Directors confirm our commitment

to protecting human rights as stated

in the Code of Conduct, the Charter of
Sustainability Commitments and the
Sustainability Plan.
