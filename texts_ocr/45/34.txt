promoting the transfer of technology and
knowledge aimed at fostering independent
local development even in non-European
countries with different levels of economic
development. Moreover, this preventive
model also allows us to address possible
risks related to climate change.

We are present in different geographical
areas of Italy and the world, some of

them in precarious or developing socio-
economic contexts, characterized by a
limited presence of large companies, a
large number of small enterprises, where
employment rates and the labour market are
not very dynamic and not always evolved.
This involves a considerable investment in
terms of both organizational and economic
resources in order to address and make

up for the shortcomings of infrastructure
networks and the lack of a widespread
business culture. Through our shipyards we
are able to guarantee economic stability to

 

entire families and territories and contribute
significantly to employment growth and the
positive evolution of the socio-economic
context of the areas in which we operate

In cases of business reorganization (mergers,
acquisitions, etc.), we try to safeguard our
people by, if necessary, assigning new tasks
with targeted training or retraining, based on
each person’s ability and experience.

We also pay close attention to the
professional capital that a territory is able
to express and try to enhance it as much

as possible. In this context, Fincantieri
purchased a majority share of the capital

of Insis, a company based in Follo (La
Spezia), operating in the IT and electronic
sectors, that employs a total of around

100 people, 70% of whom are engineers,
system engineers and specialist technicians,
namely a pool of expertise that is difficult to
find on the market or one that can only be
developed internally over a particularly long
period of time.

Thanks to the adoption of a strategic
approach to the market, over the years

we have evaluated and finalized several
M&A transactions and acquired entire
companies in financial difficulties but with
solid industrial backgrounds, also giving
priority to direct hiring or hiring through
our chain of subsidiaries belonging to the
Group. These actions have enabled us to
safeguard know-how, strengthen our skills
and support the economic system of the
territories in which we operate. By way of
example, Fincantieri Infrastructure took
over the company Cordioli & C. s.rl. of
Valeggio sul Mincio from the extraordinary
administration procedure managed by the
Ministry of Economic Development, in order
to increase its expertise in the construction
and major works sector and help safeguard
dozens of jobs. As part of the same
operation, Fincantieri Infrastructure started
to refurbish the industrial buildings of the
former Cordioli plant, equipping them with
new technologically advanced equipment
for cutting, welding and processing

steel, even for large thicknesses, and
therefore rebuilding a solid production and
employment base.

In addition, it is worth mentioning that since
early 2019, Fincantieri has been working with
the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region, and more
specifically with the Central Directorate for
Work, Training, Education and Family, in
order to encourage the redeployment of
unemployed staff who have left companies
in crisis in the area. The activity, in particular,
involved the over 150 workers of the
company Eaton s.r.l. who participated in

a selection process with Fincantieri, the
economic satellite businesses and the

 

FINCANTIERI GROUP @ -----+------++-:

Regional Employment Centre which, in
many cases, ended with them being hired
by Fincantieri or by satellite businesses.
Some resources were included in pre-hiring
training courses aimed at acquiring the skills
of the main shipbuilding trades (e.g. welders,
carpenters, pipers) which the Region is
promoting in collaboration with Fincantieri.

In order to relaunch the shipbuilding hub

in the port of Palermo, a protocol of intent
was signed between the Authority of the
Western Sicilian maritime port system and
Fincantieri, with the shared objective of
establishing the Sicilian site as one of the
most important centres in the Mediterranean
The Palermo site also completed the process
for RINA to issue OHSAS 18001 and ISO
14001 certificates of conformity, the highest
international standards of health and safety
at work and environmental protection.

With this result, the company arrived at full
coverage of all the Group’s certified Italian
production units.

We have also signed a preliminary
cooperation agreement with Cassa

Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and Snam aimed
at identifying, defining and implementing
strategic medium-term projects in some

key segments for innovation and the
development of the Italian ports and the
development of sustainable technologies for
sea transport, in line with the Proposals of
the National Integrated Plan for Energy and
the Climate (PNIEC). Fincantieri and Snam
will share their technical expertise by setting
up dedicated working groups and CDP will
support, from an economic and financial
perspective and in line with its institutional
