labour rights, with specific focus on ethical
and reputational aspects during both the
qualification and the monitoring phases.
These values are essential for the whole
Group and are a priority in all company
decisions, including those relating to the
pool of suppliers.

Evaluation of certain fundamental
aspects, such as the technical/orofessional
suitability of the company, the regularity
of contributions and remuneration of

employees, and the existence of a structure
dedicated to safety at work, takes place
during both the pre-qualification document
collection phase and the quality inspection
phase at the supplier’s premises, as well as
during entry in our shipyards.

For us business integrity and the ethical

and reputational aspects that accompany

it are a constant guideline. We are aware
that corporate reputation is a strategic asset

that should be valued and protected, also
so as not to compromise the trust placed
in us by our stakeholders, and by using a
risk intelligence based strategy we ensure
that our supply chain leans towards more
extensive compliance with regard to anti-
money laundering, counter-terrorism, anti-
corruption and sanctions at international
level.

Furthermore, in order to prevent any

possible infiltration of organized crime in the

FINCANTIERI GROUP e

contract award phase, in capital expenditure
and in production activities, our Group has
established a stronger cooperation with

the local competent Prefectures, stipulating
Legality and Transparency Protocols, which
since 2017 have merged into a National
Protocol.

Data on qualification and monitoring
activities in 2018 and 2019 are given below.
