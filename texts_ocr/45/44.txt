An important part of our
business is the offshore
market. Current trends in this
sector are driven by the need
to more efficiently harness
the maritime environment
through the use of structures
aimed at work and life at

sea as well as clean energy
production. The displacement
of offshore activities to ever
remote areas will require the

study of support vehicles
for transferring people and
materials to and from land
The main projects active and
related to these issues are:

Modular Production
Platform: the project aims
to develop a concept of
modular floating platform
for offshore operations,
particularly for the initial
stage of oil and gas
exploitation

Inertial Sea Wave Energy
Converter: the project aims
to design an innovative
system to convert sea waves
into electrical energy. Within
the consortium, Fincantieri
deals in particular with
making the system suitable
for the marine environment,
structural studies and
innovative materials for the
hull construction
