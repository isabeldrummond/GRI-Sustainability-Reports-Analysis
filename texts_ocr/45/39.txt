@ FINCANTIERI GROUP

The Group develops the projects in the
Research and Innovation Plan with the

aim of ensuring a competitive advantage

for the Group and for the companies that
collaborated to achieve common results.
The value generated by Research and
Innovation projects is captured in particular
through two fundamental processes:
technology transfer and intellectual property
management.

The first is a fundamental step to transfer
knowledge, even if intangible, into services
and applied technologies aimed at a wider
audience of users. In particular, this phase
takes place after each project is closed

and is aimed at ensuring that the results,
including intangible knowledge, models and
algorithms, are correctly transmitted to the
relevant departments of all divisions. Once
inalized, all the project documentation and
he material produced are uploaded to a
special database which can be accessed by
he designers after a simple request.

 

However, while enlarging the user base

aids the marketing of the technology, if the
intellectual property of the results attained
rom the research is not properly protected,
here is a risk that the competitive
advantage obtained will be nullified. It is
herefore essential to protect the intellectual
property of the results obtained, delivered
hrough not only collaboration with suppliers
but also joint work with universities and
research centres, assessing, on a case-
by-case basis, whether it is appropriate

0 use it as an industrial secret or by

iling trademarks, patents and models. In

 

his context, we have set ourselves the

objective of ensuring, in any case, that
researchers collaborating in the projects
have the freedom to publish by designing
processes that allow us to quickly assess
the advisability of filing patent applications,
and agreeing on a case-by-case basis on the
degree of abstraction of the publications,

so as to ensure effective protection of their
industrial secrets.

In conducting Research and Innovation
activities, we use the support of the CETENA
research centre. Thanks to its experience

in research and consultancy in the naval

and maritime field since 1962, this is the
cornerstone of the Group’s pre-competitive
research. CETENA’s main tasks range from
fluid dynamics to structural design, including
the application of innovative materials, from
energy efficiency and control of emissions to
safety issues, and from the development of
software and simulators to testing activities.

WE COOPERATE IN ORDER TO CREATE VALUE

In order to take full advantage of Research
and Innovation processes, in addition to
making the most of our internal expertise,
we are aware of our role as an integrator,
wholeheartedly adopting the Open
Innovation paradigm, researching and
proposing collaborations with partners
operating upstream in their own value
chain, or with other stakeholders working to
innovate tools, products and services in the
maritime field.

We often promote long-term relationships
through the creation of wide-ranging
cooperative develooment programs.

Aware of the significant boost that these
can provide, we continuously aim to
expand our partnership networks at local
and international level, both within the
projects we finance independently and by
cooperating in the creation of consortia that
respond to the innovation challenges raised
by public actors, such as the Horizon 2020
programme.
