However, there are critical issues related

to the new technologies. In general, the
new technological solutions and systems
introduced for the protection of the
environment occupy volumes previously
intended for the payload. In the case of
LNG, accommodating the tanks on board
Cin addition to the liquid fuel tanks) and
installing the related operating and safety
systems entails a significant reduction of the
useful space on board. The development of
a logistics system capable of ensuring the
availability of LNG (including intermediate
storage and bunkering systems) in all major
cruise destinations is still at an embryonic
stage, consequently limiting the area of
operation on new ships.

USE OF BATTERY MODULES
To cover the Supplementation of the electric
entire load on power supplied by the batteries with
board a traditional generation system (as in

hybrid cars).
The energy supplied by the batteries
is used:

® exclusively in particular situations
(for example in port), or

® supplemented by the on-board
diesel engines at times of
maximum power demand (e.g.
maximum speed navigation).

The future lies in the application of fuel cells,

electrochemical conversion devices that
generate electricity and heat by combining
a fuel (typically hydrogen, methanol or
methane) and a comburent (oxygen), in

the absence of combustion. In this way, no
polluting substances are actually produced.
After the initial development phase, linked
to space exploration and the naval field
(submarines), terrestrial applications for the
generation of electricity and propulsion (for
example prototype trains fuelled by fuel
cells) are spreading. Studies and research
are being carried out on their application for
generating energy for cruise ships.

  
 
  
  
  
  
 
  

  

 

 

In collaboration with the Consiglio Nazionale
delle Ricerche (CNR, National Research
Council) and the Universities of Genoa,
Naples and Palermo, with the contribution
of the Italian Ministry of Economic
Development, we have developed a project
to realize a laboratory ship approximately
25 metres long to study power generation
technologies with low environmental impact.

Treatment and storage of solid and liquid waste

Waste treatment is regulated by MARPOL:

e Annex | Prevention of pollution by oil and oily
water.

e Annex IV Prevention of pollution by sewage.

e Annex V Prevention of pollution by
shipboard waste.

The boat, called Zeus, will be powered by
electric propulsion engines, which will be
powered by a fuel cell system of about 120
kW and a battery system capable of ensuring
around 6 hours’ navigation autonomy at

zero emissions, thanks to about 50 kg

of hydrogen contained in metal hydride
cylinders. Zeus will be the first marine vessel
powered exclusively by fuel cells.

The increasingly stringent regulations in force
in areas with a strong cruise vocation and
vulnerable ecosystems, such as Alaska and the
Baltic Sea, determine the characteristics of the
latest generation cruise ships.

Only bacteriologically and chemically pure
water, with an extremely low hydrocarbon
content, can be discharged into the sea
(under certain conditions) in these areas. Any
other residue must be stored on board and
unloaded in port for further treatment.
