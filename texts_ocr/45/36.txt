OUR ECONOMIC SATELLITE BUSINESSES

As already mentioned, we believe in an
economy that is a system of relations, an
integrated dynamic network, built over time
to create and exchange value. Thanks to a
competitive production model that is strongly
linked to the Italian production network,
Fincantieri generates additional impact on
the national economy.

According to a Censis study, the Fifth Report
on the Economy of the Sea 2015, every euro
invested in shipyards produces a value 4.5
times greater, mostly benefitting the area
where it is located, through the involvement

of a wide and diverse network of companies,
many of which are highly specialized small or
medium-sized enterprises.

Each cruise ship built by Fincantieri develops
on average € 2.7 to € 3.6 billion of business
volume for the Italian System:

¢ directly generated by Fincantieri: about €
600 to 800 million;

¢ additional through stimulation of satellite
businesses: about € 21 to 2.8 billion.

The impact on employment can be calculated
by initially considering direct employment,
that is direct jobs at Fincantieri in Italy, to
which first-tier indirect employment is added,
that is jobs at Fincantieri contractors, as well
as second-tier employment, represented by
jobs at sub-contractors. In turn, it is necessary
to add to this final employment figure the
satellite business jobs due to consumption by
the families of all employees

MULTIPLIER

From the graph it can be seen that:

e the approximately 9,300 direct resources
at Fincantieri activate in Italy more than
54,000 employment units in industry
(considering contracts and subcontracts) in
the manufacturing industry;

e adding to this the induced effect of family
consumption, employment exceeds 86,000
units

 

Considering both the effects upstream and

downstream of its production organization,

Fincantieri therefore has a significant

employment multiplier effect of about 8.9x,

confirming the broad impact the Company
has on the country’s economic system
