In embracing the Open Innovation model,
we take into account a wide range of
stakeholders:

These take part in various collaborative e
projects, giving an important contribution
to basic research topics. They cooperate
in the development of innovative ideas to
transfer onto the product.

 

@ The activities aimed at identifying

i the technological priorities to be
developed in the short, medium

and long term and that have highly
strategic importance and guarantee
value added for future products.

A common strategy: from global to local
level

In the context of the Group’s collaborations,
those activated to define our medium-

long term vision and to jointly define the
documents setting out the sector’s priorities,
at local, national and supranational level, are
particularly important.

n addition to maintaining a large number of
bilateral relationships with other companies
in our sector, and with universities and
research institutes, we are active in various
associations and forums, with the aim of
both contributing to the definition of sector
roadmaps at a general level, and providing
our contribution on individual technical

or technological issues, including through
he activation of pre-competitive research
projects.

During 2019, we actively participated in

he work of European sectoral technology
associations. One of the most important
strategic partners of the European
Commission is represented by the European
Technology Platform WATERBORNE, of
which we are active members. The platform
aims to maintain continuous dialogue
between all stakeholders in the maritime,
naval, port, logistics and blue growth fields
(an expression that brings together various
economic activities including, for example,
fisheries, aquaculture, maritime tourism,
maritime biotechnology, collection of
renewable energy from oceans, mining from
the ocean floor), through the consolidation
of a shared consensus aimed at identifying

European priorities for Research and
Technological Innovation.

The WATERBORNE Technology Platform,
which updated its Strategic Research
Agenda in 2019, played a key role in
proposing the establishment of the co-
Programmed European Partnership
“Zero-emission waterborne transport” to
be launched within the Horizon Europe
programme to develop solutions to
transform the waterborne transport sector
into a zero-emission sector towards the
year 2050, in line with the objectives of the
European Green Deal.

Fincantieri has contributed to the policy
papers of the industry associations Sea
Europe and Hydrogen Europe. The former
is the European association of shipyards
and manufacturers of maritime systems,
while the latter is the European association
representing the industry and research for
the development of hydrogen technologies
and fuel cells. In particular, Hydrogen
Europe, among its objectives, aims to
support the launch of the institutionalized
European partnership “Clean Hydrogen for
Europe’ in the Horizon Europe programme
and to support the activities of the "Fuel
Cells and Hydrogen” Joint Undertaking (FCH
JU) of Horizon 2020.

At European level, we also cooperate with:
e EuroYards, the association of leading
European manufacturers, where we

actively contribute to the activities
of the technical committee and the
