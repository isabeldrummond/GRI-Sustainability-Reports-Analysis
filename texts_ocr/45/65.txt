In line with the Sustainability Plan, and as
part of the Corporate University’s training
programmes, we have introduced a module
dedicated to sustainability issues. In 2019,
131 employees were trained on these issues.

* Safety Academy: includes training courses
on health, safety and the environment
that the Company offers its employees
as activities aimed at providing useful
knowledge for identifying, reducing
and managing risks in the workplace.
During 2019, training activities relating
to environmental management were
increased, with courses dedicated to
specific professional figures such as
energy managers and resources involved
in managing environmental and safety
certification systems.

Team building

During the year, we have proposed various
team building activities with the aim,

on the one hand, of understanding the
obstacles hindering team performance
and identifying the most valid mechanisms

 

 

for bringing together, communicating and
working synergistically among different
generations and, on the other, working on
trust/esteem to break down barriers and
create a shared team identity, starting from
the enhancement of individual peculiarities
and pride linked to the sense of belonging
to the Group. One of the most significant
team building initiatives is the “Development
Challenge”, dedicated to young resources
who have already completed the Academy
course and continuing their training in
order to reactivate group dynamics, and
the “Effective Relationships” course, which
is intended for production supervisors

and technical figures in the shipyard, as an
opportunity to develop management and
relational skills.

Evaluation processes

The assessment processes are based on
the Company Skills Model which aims

to enhance and encourage consistent
behaviour at all levels of the organization
and to develop the appropriate skills to
deal with future challenges. This model
includes skills related to “knowing”, such

as knowledge of corporate strategy and
specialist and process know-how, “knowing
how to do”, such as the skills and abilities
possessed and the experience gained,

and “knowing how to be”, namely those
soft skills necessary to ensure appropriate
interaction between the individual and

the organizational context (leadership,
teamwork, feedback, staff management).
The evaluation processes in place at
Fincantieri are structured in order to ensure

the most complete, objective and analytical
view of the various dimensions under
evaluation.

* Performance appraisal: a key tool in
human capital development processes
that aims to improve employees’
performance through individual feedback
that all employees, from workers to
managers, receive at least once a year.
This tool supports and directs meritocratic
appraisals, helos customize the personal
development processes and define the
training offered in line with the skills gaps
highlighted.

The data refer to the entire Fincantieri Group.

* 360° assessment: a tool intended for all
managers with at least five staff members.
It aims to assess the typical skills of team
managers, such as feedback, delegation,
development of team members and
recognition of others, and aims to provide
the evaluator with a complete overview of
the skills being evaluated by comparing

self-assessment and assessment by others.
At the beginning of the year the Parent
Company completed the 360° assessment
process that had begun in 2018.

Potential appraisal: aimed at a target
group of resources determined by age,
company seniority, role and qualification
requirements. It takes the form of an
assessment activity which, on the one
hand, offers the possibility of highlighting,
through feedback interviews, the strengths,
areas of improvement and growth
motivation and, on the other hand, makes
it possible to structure an individual
development plan in terms of short/
medium-term training activities, coaching,
mentoring, career paths and job rotation.

People development

During 2019, people review activities,
which are an active management tool used
by the HR Department and managers to
develop employees, played a key role in
enhancing human capital and defining
professional growth paths and succession
plans. People review activities are launched
from a synergistic work carried out every
six months by the HR Department and by
the business line and allow the population
to be mapped using the data related to the
performance appraisal, potential appraisal
and the experience gained within the
Company in a systematic and structured
way. The strategic output that emerges
from this mapping is the identification of
high potential, namely those resources
with greater potential and usefulness in the
Company, on which to invest so that in the
