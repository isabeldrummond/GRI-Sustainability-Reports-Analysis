and employees of contractors) present at
individual shipyards. During working hours
and directly at the workplace, the individual
supervisors explain the subject matter to
their staff, who are given a leaflet. In 2019,

9 different editions were carried out with a
duration of approximately 30 minutes each,
which is in addition to the activities required
by law.

Memorandum of understanding with INAIL

In April 2019, we signed with the National
Institute for Insurance against Accidents
at Work (INAIL) a memorandum of
understanding aimed at developing a
safety at work culture and at implementing
activities and projects with the goal of
consistently reducing accidents and
occupational diseases. The MoU, which
follows on from long-term cooperation,
determines the scope and implementation
methodologies of activities aimed at
protecting workers’ health and safety. In
particular:

* production process analysis, with respect
to the risks related to the shipbuilding
industry and in particular those arising
from interferences between the activities
of internal and external resources;
monitoring of the health and safety
management ystem in place for contract
work in the shipbuilding industry and its
possible evolution;

evolution analysis of accidents in the
represented sectors, supplemented with
a comparison of the data collected at
European level;

 

 

 

* analysis of the current near miss model
mapping (i.e. events which potentially can
cause accidents) and its possible evolution;

* identification and implementation of new
training and information initiatives aimed
at promoting a culture of prevention,
and innovative communication tools to
strengthen workers’ awareness of the
risks in the production process and the
appropriate safety measures.

Supplier evaluation

Safety, environmental and human rights
issues are an integral part of the supplier
evaluation process. Contractors are already
subject to evaluation from a financial, quality,
contractual and production perspective and
they are assessed using a predefined format
and scorecards focused on health, safety
and environment issues. The assessments

by the various shipyards have led to the
calculation of the overall performances of
the companies and are subject to permanent
monitoring within Supplier Oversight.

 

 

 

 

 

Security

Owing to the more frequent and widespread
presence of employees who travel or are

on secondment abroad, with the Travel
Security programme we have developed

an ongoing mapping of risks in foreign
countries to guarantee the security of
travelling employees and the sustainability
of the locations associated with business
operations. Therefore, around 16,000 foreign
travel routes are monitored.

As required by the Sustainability Plan,
through the activation of a Crisis
Management system (abroad), 12
contingency plans have been drawn up and
updated for the most important foreign
sites and locations where the Company is
present. The plans are managed by special
crisis committees (CMTs) which include, in
addition to employers, travellers and the
relevant Health and Safety Department
Managers, the heads of all functions involved
in the travel and personnel management
process. Each CMT, in accordance with
corporate procedures, met at least twice

a year, to update team members on the

FINCANTIERI GROUP e

evolution of risks present in local scenarios
and for training and education activities
based on contingency plans. We also have a
Virtual Crisis Management software platform,
which allows committees to meet virtually to
manage possible crisis situations even when
on the move or when the Company is closed
(at night or on holidays).

With reference to the security problems
connected to the globalization of the
business, mention should be made of the
International Ship and Port Facility Security
(ISPS) Code, Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS
Regulation developed by the International
arine Organization (IMO), a comprehensive
set of rules to enhance ship and port facility
security in order to mitigate the risk of acts
of terrorism and other unlawful acts. On the
basis of the types of ships interacting with the
areas pertaining to Fincantieri, the relevant
authority has determined its obligation for

he Arsenale Triestino San Marco, Muggiano
and Palermo shipyards, while considering

he Monfalcone and Marghera shipyards

as occasional. The necessary professional
igures have already been identified at these
shipyards, and the planned activities and
acilities have been implemented. Following
on from our commitment to maintain an
effective system of corporate governance and
risk management, we have decided to launch
a project to implement the ISPS Code, in
order to adopt a methodology in line with the
above-mentioned international best practices,
to protect our assets as well as its ship
product, also for the Ancona, Castellammare
di Stabia, Genoa Sestri Ponente, Riva Trigoso
shipyards and for the Trieste, Rome and
Genoa Offices.
