adopt in order to pursue a development that
integrates competitiveness, environmental

To guarantee respect for human rights in
the supply chain, a specific objective has
been included in the Sustainability Plan that
provides for annual second-party audits to
monitor and evaluate strategic suppliers

in terms of respect for human rights,
safeguarding workers’ health and safety, and
protecting the environment.

For more details on the Suppliers’ Code of Ethics and audits,
please refer to the chapter “For a sustainable supply chain”.

 

WE PROTECT DATA AND INFORMATION

The Company’s focus on cyber security

has gradually intensified in response to the
ever-increasing complexity and frequency of
cyber attacks carried out against companies
with national and international strategic
importance. The sophistication of cyber
threats - made possible by the operation of
consolidated international groups, some of
which supported by the governments of the
countries to which they belong - requires
the constant adjustment of the company’s
defenses and processes for protecting IT
assets, as an additional element to protect
the Company’s industrial know-how and
market competitiveness.

For this reason, in 2019 we further
strengthened the Cyber Security function,
activating a pervasive multi-year program
focused on managing and mitigating cyber
risks, which develops far-reaching project
initiatives on the company’s technological
infrastructure, such as:

® creation of a program to protect the
industrial networks supporting ship
production on 4 pilot shipyards
(Monfalcone, Marghera, Ancona and Riva
Trigoso) to allow the monitoring, protection
and management of field equipment;

e development of a model to manage
cyber security aspects related to product
development processes;

e definition of the Group business model
with regard to the Information Security
Policy Architecture;

¢ implementation of tools based on Artificial
Intelligence to identify a standard
behavioural model capable of highlighting
any anomalies in user actions;

¢ central monitoring of core corporate
services;

FINCANTIERI GROUP

¢ lifecycle management of cyber security
incidents;

* conducting periodic IT security
assessments aimed at identifying and
remedying any gaps;

* providing awareness campaigns to
employees, aimed at improving awareness
of cyber risks and shedding light on the
most widespread attack techniques (e.g.
social engineering) and the organizational
and behavioural methods for neutralizing
them;

® managing cyber risks within a more
general framework of operational risks that
may negatively impact on the Company’s
business and image

Fincantieri - in its capacity as a strategic
company for the national system - continues
to collaborate with the State Police and
other important national institutions
through information sharing activities on
significant cyber events recorded on its IT
infrastructure.

We are aware of our social responsibilities
and in light of the full transposition of the
principles laid down to protect personal
data, we have launched a process to comply
with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of
27 April 2016 on the protection of natural
persons with regard to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement of
such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/
EC (the GDPR), became fully applicable on
25 May 2018. At the end of this process, the
Company adopted a privacy management
system, whose founding principles are
contained in the Policy on General Principles
