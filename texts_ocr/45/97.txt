DESCRIPTION OF MATERIAL TOPICS

Governance and business integrity
Business integrity is the capacity to develop
the business fairly and transparently and is a
key factor characterizing the identity of the
Group, as well as an important element in its
reputation.

Responsible governance ensures fair and
transparent conditions in the conduct of
business affairs and the related company
activities, protecting the company image
and reputation, meeting the expectations of
stakeholders and safeguarding the work of
employees.

Cyber security

The focus on cyber security has gradually
intensified in response to the ever-increasing
complexity and frequency of cyber attacks
carried out against companies with national
and international strategic importance, making
it necessary to constantly adapt the corporate
defences and processes for safeguarding IT
assets.

Protecting the integrity and confidentiality

of data and information has become a pillar
of the corporate digital strategy. The Group
guarantees the protection of computer
systems and data by avoiding the risk of
network breaches, corruption of sensitive data
or processes, using prevention, detection and
measures against potential cyber attacks.

Economic and financial sustainability

The Group is committed to increasingly
sustainable and responsible performance,
creating the conditions for development which
meets the needs and expectations of all its
stakeholders.

Innovation, research and development
Technological excellence is a key element
of the Group’s entrepreneurial approach,
which allows it to maintain and strengthen
its competitiveness and leading position in
complex, markets with high potential.

Employment protection and trade union
relations

People are the key assets of the Group and
their protection generates wealth for the

company. Individual growth comes with
constant collaboration and cooperation,
factoring in common ideas and practice,

skills and actions, international exchange and
comparison and a multidisciplinary approach.
Industrial relations in Fincantieri are based

on a participative model which values and
enhances the role of trade unions and workers,
also through the establishment of appropriate
joint committees.

Procurement activities

A significant portion of the overall value

of each ship depends on materials, parts,
components and turnkey systems supplied
by third parties. The Group actively manages
its make-or-buy procurement strategies and
therefore the size of the contribution of third
party suppliers to the overall value of the
project, also through rigorous qualification
processes.

Product quality and compliance with
technical standards

Excellent levels of quality are in the DNA of the
Group, because the complexity of its business
requires high standards in terms of quality and
compliance with technical regulations and
standards, at each stage of the production
process. Responsibility for ensuring quality is
widespread and shared.

Customer satisfaction

Customers and their satisfaction are at the
centre of the Group’s interest; customer
satisfaction is pursued by constantly involving
the customer at the execution stage, in the
continuous monitoring of quality and through
the offer of innovative products.

Climate change

The Group manages the risks related to
climate change, constantly researching new
methods to improve its practices and minimize
the impact of emissions resulting from its
industrial activities. It supports research
projects in collaboration with research
institutes/universities on issues associated with
climate risks.

Environmental management

Environmental protection is at the centre of
the activities of the Company, which must
commit itself, in carrying out its activities,

to making the principles of environmental
sustainability its own, both in its strategic
choices and in its business processes.

To this end it must commit itself to improving
energy efficiency and saving, proper
management of water resources and correct
disposal of waste and effluent.

Safeguarding the natural value of the

areas affected by shipyard activities is also
important. To protect these delicate places,
specific and special precautions are put in
place in accordance with local legislation.

Environmental impact of products and
services
The Group operates with a “life cycle”
approach, aiming to minimize the
environmental and social impact of a product
or service over its life cycle, departing
therefore from a model which sees the impact
on the environment and society of only
production activities, and broadening the
analysis of possible negative external effects
to all the links in the value chain

Diversity and equal opportunity

Diversity allows all the transformations

and changes currently taking place to be
embraced and represents an open, flexible
and helpful relational approach. With regard to
equal opportunities, significant commitment
has been given to increasing the presence of
women in the Company.

 

Company welfare

This is an innovative tool which permits
efficient management of resources and
provides an alternative to traditional pay and
incentive mechanisms. The ultimate aim is to
improve the quality of life and wellbeing of
employees and their families.

Health and safety in the workplace

Safety at work is a condition for the
performance of work without exposure

to the risk of accidents or occupational
disease. Historically Fincantieri has dedicated
significant effort to the protection of health
and safety; over the years it has promoted a
profound change in safety culture, as a first
step towards further development. The key
element is personnel training as a tool for risk
prevention.

Training and education

nvestment in staff training and development is
of strategic importance in terms of restoring a
high level of skill and know-how in the field, at
all levels.

Accordingly the training on offer has been
expanded with new technical and managerial
raining programmes.

Local communities and relations with the
local area

Local development is directly linked both
with business activities and with the ability to
systematically involve local players, showing
awareness of the impact on the community.
n terms of business activities, networks of
small and medium-sized enterprises (SME),
highly specialized in various macro-sectors,
are engaged.

n addition, initiatives to promote the
development of local communities are
stimulated and encouraged, with the aim of
creating shared value.

 

Human rights

The Company has a strong commitment to
ensuring that the skills and competencies of
each employee are developed and maintained,
both through recognition of merit and respect
for equal opportunities, with the aim of
safeguarding the human rights sanctioned by
the Universal Declaration of the UN. Moreover
the Group has always paid the maximum
attention to ensuring transparency and
observance of agreements and laws governing
the contracting (tendering) system, a key
element in its own development capacity and
competitiveness in the relevant markets.
