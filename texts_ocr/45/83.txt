@ FINCANTIERI GROUP

As per the objective of the Sustainability
Plan, we are committed to increasing the
share of electricity from renewable sources.
In 2019, about 50% of the electricity needed
to satisfy the demand of Italian production
sites and companies was purchased

and sourced from renewable sources
(hydroelectric, wind, photovoltaic) certified
with Guarantees of Origin (GO). Taking

also into account the contribution of the
subsidiary VARD in relation to its Norwegian
sites, 40% of the electricity consumed by the
entire Group comes from renewable sources.

In other countries the purchase and
production of energy from renewable
sources was not significant for reporting
purposes.

In addition to the actions undertaken in
previous years and during 2019, we have
included in our Sustainability Plan the
objective of obtaining ISO 50001:2018
certification for the Energy Management
System of Fincantieri S.p.A. by 2021. With
this in mind, a gap analysis was carried

out in 2019 with the aim of assessing

the current energy management system
against the requirements of the standard
and consequently identifying the activities
needed in order to obtain certification. The
activity involved representatives of the main
organizational units concerned with the
certification process, who will subsequently
play an active role in maintaining it. The
process of identifying and formalizing
specific working groups (Energy Team) has
been initiated and more than 50 people
throughout the Company are expected to be
involved.

Water

Water is a precious natural resource whose
availability is increasingly limited owing to
climate change. Safeguarding it is one of
the main commitments in our Policy and is
also one of the aims of the communication/
awareness project, aimed at promoting
virtuous and eco-sustainable day-to-day
behaviour.

We take measures to improve efficiency in
the use and quality of water as part of our
environmental management systems at the
level of individual shipyards. We monitor
water consumption during the production
cycle, planning and implementing system
interventions aimed at saving water resources.

 

 

 

The main initiatives implemented concern
leakage tests and repairs to distribution
networks, implementation of more efficient
gasification systems for the technical gas
tanks, and installation of timed mixers in
changing rooms.

Fincantieri Marine Group has also
implemented systematic network leakage
monitoring activities, which have led to

a significant reduction in drinking water
consumption.

72% of the water is taken from the municipal/
state water supplies, 27% from the ground
water and 1% from the sea, there are no other
types of withdrawal. Water withdrawals are
mainly used in the production and sanitation
process.
