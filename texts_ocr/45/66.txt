future they can play key roles in driving the
business. The ultimate goal of people review
meetings is to plan the development actions
necessary to accompany the growth of
talent through a career path, with structured
job rotations that provide for both
horizontal and vertical growth, national and
international mobility activities, training and
mentoring that support the development

of interpersonal skills and encourage the
creation of a professional network, even
outside the area in which the talent works.
More specifically, there were 198 people
involved in mobility processes in 2019.

Once a year, in order to ensure effective
oversight of key positions and allow for
structured and organic reflection on the
Group’s managerial assets, succession

plans for top management are updated to
guarantee and safeguard continuity, stability
and oversight of the business.

We have developed coaching in a more
structured and widespread way to
enhance management effectiveness. This
is a voluntary development tool aimed

at facilitating and supporting resources
in becoming aware of themselves, their
possibilities and potential, allowing them
to plan development actions aimed at
strengthening and consolidating their
managerial skills.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AS AN ASSET

We reject any form of discrimination based
on ethnicity, colour, gender, age, disability,
sexual orientation, religion, political
opinion, nationality and social origin. We
are committed to maintaining a work
environment that is free from any and all
forms of violence or harassment.

The Group has therefore adopted the
Policy on Human Rights - Commitment
for the Respect of Human Rights and
Diversity, which reaffirms our commitment
to protecting human rights and promoting
diversity as strategic elements for the
company’s competitiveness and the
development of our people. We operate
with utmost respect for diversity and equal
opportunities and we do not permit any kind
of discrimination, from personnel selection
and throughout the entire employment
relationship. The change management
path that characterizes the Fincantieri for
the Future initiative is a pure expression

of how each person, regardless of gender,
age or nationality, represents a source of
“wealth” for the Company. The presence

of different skills, experiences and cultures
fuels the exchange of opinions, comparison
and dialogue, promoting the growth of
the organization, intellectual enrichment,
innovation and the gradual development of
an inclusive working environment.

 

 

In order to enhance diversity and promote
inclusion, in line with the existing regulatory
framework for equal opportunities, we are
committed to:

* creating an inclusive work environment
that ensures respect, integrity, personal
development and equal opportunities;

* increasing employee awareness of diversity
and equal opportunities;

* encouraging the commitment of all Group
employees to act with respect and integrity
in every relationship;

* requiring suppliers to behave in a manner
consistent with respect for human dignity.
