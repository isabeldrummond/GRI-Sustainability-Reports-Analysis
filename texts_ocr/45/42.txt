@ FINCANTIERI GROUP

OUR MAIN PROJECTS

In 2019, we have activated over 90 Research and Innovation
projects, funded through our own resources and through
Research and Innovation programmes funded at European,
national and regional level. Some of the projects are carried
out through close cooperation with universities and research
institutes, through the awarding of specific assignments

or the funding of doctoral fellowships, research grants,

or positions in partner universities. All the projects can

be classified within 5 development trajectories, which are
Fincantieri’s vision for the sector.

  

Green Ship eo

For the past several years,
the concept of greening has
established itself as one of
the guidelines for innovation
processes and has acquired
fundamental importance in
the eyes of the public. The
European Union, with the
recent European Green Deal,
the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) and the
Cruise Line International
Association (CLIA), have
defined precise objectives to
reduce polluting emissions Cin
particular CO,) for the next
decades.

 

We consider Green Ship as
a milestone of our vision
and the activities carried
out in 2019 confirm this
commitment.

Recent contracts, whether
they are related to the
sectors of new builds or
refitting, feature the use

of advanced technologies,
such as liquefied natural gas
(LNG), batteries, modern
pollutant reducing and
energy saving systems.
Fincantieri applies a holistic
approach in design and
building, integrating in the
best way the systems on
board, pursuing continuous
improvement in energy
efficiency and supporting the
introduction of new green
fuels, technologies for de-
carbonization, including fuel
cells, as well as the study of
high-performance materials.
The main projects active and
related to these issues are:

 

  

@ RESEARCH
' AND INNOVATION
PROJECTS

* Technologies with low
environmental impact:

a project conducted in
cooperation with the CNR
and the Universities of
Genoa, Naples and Palermo,
funded by the Italian Ministry
of Economic Development.
The project sets out to
realize a laboratory ship
approximately 25 metres
long to study power
generation technologies with
low environmental impact.
Sustainable Ship Design
Program: the project aims

to create and validate a
holistic approach to energy
efficiency and emission
reduction in ship design, also
through a careful control

of EEDI (Energy Efficiency
Design Index).

¢ PIAQUO - Practical
Implementation of AQUO: a
cooperative project financed
by the European LIFE
programme, which aims to
mitigate issues related to
underwater noise and reduce
its impact on the marine
ecosystem by optimizing
propellers and developing
a self-assessment model in
real time.

¢ ESS Control System
(v2.0): the project, financed
internally by the subsidiary
VARD, aims to study more
capacious batteries, at a
reduced cost, combined
with an advanced
management and control
system for energy storage
in order to guarantee longer
autonomy and improve
device safety.

¢ DC Grid Power Analysis: the
project, financed internally
by the subsidiary VARD,
aims to optimize the Direct
Current (DC) grid through
advanced techniques for
the simulation of micro grid
applications in the marine
sector.

 

Smart Ship @ on
and Autonomous ‘ ERS
Ship i Pe
In the context of the
development model
proposed by the Industry 4.0
paradigm, the enhancement
of loT (Internet of Things)
and smart devices has taken
on fundamental importance.
These are pervasive across all
industrial sectors and ships
are not exempt from this
“intelligent” revolution. The
improvement of monitoring
systems and operational
support systems give value
added to the whole ship
product and help improve
their global safety.

The study of design and
operational solutions to
reduce the frequency

of accidents, in addition

   

 

to measures capable of
improving the resilience

of ships, guarantee an
increase of overall safety.
Lastly, one of the most
interesting challenges

for the shipbuilding
industry is to develop
autonomous ships for use

in any operational scenario,
including in busy port areas.
These concepts also have
important repercussions

on maintenance and after-
sales activities, as well as
strong implications on cyber
security aspects. These
aspects of the ship product
are studied and developed
both in specifically dedicated
projects (the ECHO project,

for example) and to assess
the impacts of projects
activated with the aim of
increasing digital integration
and on-board autonomy (the
STESS project, for example).
Great importance is given

to the modelling of possible
cyber attack risks and the
countermeasures to be taken
both logically and physically
to prevent these eventualities.
The main projects related

to these issues which are
already active or in advanced
state of preparation are:

 

¢ OCEAN2020 - Open
Cooperation for European
mAritime awareNess: the
project is funded by the
European Defence Agency
(EDA) and its purpose is the
integration of unmanned
systems in addition to
