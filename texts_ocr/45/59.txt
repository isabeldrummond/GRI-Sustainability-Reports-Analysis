As envisaged in the Sustainability Plan,

we maintained all our quality certifications
in 2019. To maintain the ISO 9001:2015
certification, the Group’s divisions and
companies were subjected to official

audits by the certification body. The 12
audits conducted by the certification body
RINA in 2019 on the Quality Systems of
Fincantieri’s Italian organizations certified as
compliant resulted in satisfactory outcomes.
Moreover, in line with its responsibilities, the
company Quality body has carried out a
series of internal audits, aimed at verifying
the correct application of the corporate
documentation on processes that have a
significant impact on quality, as required by
the ISO 9001 standard. In particular, four
macro organizational areas were examined:

¢ the Quality bodies of the shipping
departments/units;

¢ the Corporate functions related to primary
processes;

¢ the Quality bodies of the production sites
(Monfalcone, Sestri, Ancona, Integrated
Shipyard);

 

«the Quality bodies of the Italian subsidiaries
(lsotta Fraschini Motori, Marine Interiors,
Cetena, Seastema, Issel Nord, Fincantieri
SI.

A total of 17 audits were carried out and

the formalized findings were almost all

class “C”, i.e. minor and/or similar to a
recommendation, with the exception of one
class “B” finding made against one of the
subsidiaries, relating to the way performance
and quality indicators are monitored.

As regards the US subsidiaries, Fincantieri
Marine Systems North America Inc. and

the Fincantieri Marine Group’s shipyards
Marinette and Green Bay have achieved ISO
9001:2015 certification. The subsidiary VARD
carries out its operations in compliance with
the Group’s Health, Safety, Environment and
Quality (HSEQ) Manual and the Policy, the
principles and strategies of which are based
on the ISO standards. VARD’s efforts are
aimed at ensuring that safety is achieved at
all times and in all areas. Its production sites
all have ISO 9001:2015 certification.

In addition to the system certifications
mentioned, the subsidiary Marine Interiors
is in charge of the design, refitting and
delivery of turnkey cabins and has achieved
the MED B product certification and MED
D process certification issued by RINA
certification body. MED certifications attest
compliance with EU Directive 2014/93/EU
- Fire Protection Requirements of Marine
Equipment Directive (MED).

n 2019, Fincantieri Infrastructure
manufactured and assembled the new
bridge in Genoa (Polcevera viaduct),
entrusting part of the production to

he Castellammare di Stabia and Sestri
shipyards: in order to do so, these shipyards
have obtained ISO EN 1090 certification -
Execution of steel structures and aluminium
structures.

n December 2019, the Naval Shipping
Division obtained the NATO AQAP 2110

Development and Production) certificate
issued by the Swiss Association for Quality
and Management Systems (SQS) for the
Genoa Department and the Muggiano and
Riva Trigoso sites.

 

Quality monitoring

In Italy, the Quality Management System is
also applied to job orders, whether they be
naval or other products, through the job
Quality Plan (QP).

The QP is a set of documents and Control
Plans attached to the contract and governs
all aspects related to quality assurance,
control and monitoring valid for the job in
question. It guides the operating structures
in the correct design, construction and
testing of the product.

The job Quality Plan is structured as follows

© object of the project;
* main characteristics of the job;
¢ applicable documents:

— for the project;

— rules, laws and regulations;

(Quality Assurance Requirements for Design,

FINCANTIERI GROUP e

— quality system standards and
procedures;
— standard to be applied;
© organizational aspects:
— organization and resources for the job;
— interfaces and communications;
¢ control and inspection plans.

When designing and building complex
products and systems, such as cruise ships,
military submarines or industrial diesel
engines, there is always the possibility that
the process may be subject to deviations
from standards, design changes, unexpected
events and supply or execution errors. These
“non-quality” events are normally detected
and tracked by internal structures, by the
customer's inspection staff and by the
classification bodies, or more rarely after
delivery, with interventions in the guarantee
and after sales period. The remedial actions
follow the industrial practice that involves
increasing costs/times to adjust, repair,
redo and replace in order to minimize the
impact for the customer. The quantitative
and qualitative analysis of these events,
appropriately recorded and classified,

gives rise to mechanisms for reviewing

the projects; in the case of shipbuilding,
the analyses trigger the processes of
continuous improvement, in order to ensure
that the same errors are not repeated in
subsequent jobs. A closing report/booklet
is produced, with the main lessons learned,
in order to share with all the operating

sites the countermeasures to the error
causes identified and make the consequent
prevention and improvement actions
possible.
