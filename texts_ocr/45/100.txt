Fincantieri is aware that its level of responsibility is judged by its ability to combine, in its work, professionalism and
quality with strict respect for laws and consideration for the needs and expectations of the community in relation

to the protection of public goods. Fincantieri wants to represent a model of excellence also in terms of maximum
environmental protection.

To manage the more significant environmental aspects and prevent its business having an environmental impact,
Fincantieri is committed to implementing and maintaining an Environmental Management System and obtaining the
relevant certification in accordance with international standard ISO 14001 at its sites.

203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts 68-69 Natural gas GJ 430,935 425,761

For the analysis and description of the main indirect economic impacts, Fincantieri has used an econometric model
developed by Censis (a Foundation recognized with Decree of the President of the Republic 712/1973). The impact
measures were calculated using the analysis and calculation methodology based on Leontief input-output tables,
although this model was substantially modified to adapt it to the specific Fincantieri production and company
structure. The estimates can be considered sufficiently robust proxies for the multiplier effects that Fincantieri is
able to produce within the national economic system, given its specific production model, the business model that
the Company has built in recent years and the structure of the supply chain, with the relative levels of integration
upstream of the production cycle for naval vessels.
