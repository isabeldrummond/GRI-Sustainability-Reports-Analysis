OUR IDENTITY

The Group, which has its headquarters in
Trieste, has built more than 7,000 vessels

in its over 230 years of history. With 19,823
employees, including more than 9,300 in Italy,
and 20 shipyards spanning 4 continents, our
customers include the major cruise operators,
the Italian and US Navy, as well as several
foreign Navies. We are a partner of some of
the main European defence companies within
supranational programs.

Fincantieri is focused on customer satisfaction
and for this reason, over the years, it has
evolved its organizational structure to adapt
it to the Group’s strategies and to respond

to the challenges posed by the market in a
timely manner. Today the Group consists of

a number of companies with headquarters

in Italy and around the world, and adopts

an integrated production model based on
excellence. Fincantieri has 82 subsidiaries,

26 of which are Italian and 56 of which are
foreign. As part of its growth and business
strengthening strategy, 14 new companies
were acquired or established in 2019. In
particular, in order to strengthen activities in
high-tech sectors, during the year a majority
stake was acquired in Insis S.p.A., a company
active in the information technology and cyber
security sectors, which operates on domestic
and foreign markets both directly and as

a technological partner of large industrial
groups

Fincantieri's business is widely diversified by
end markets, geographical exposure and by
client base, with revenue mainly generated
from cruise ship, naval and offshore vessel
construction. Compared with less diversified
players, such diversification allows it to
mitigate the effects of any fluctuations in
demand on the end markets served.
