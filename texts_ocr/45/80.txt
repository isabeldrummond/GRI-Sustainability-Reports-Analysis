TO REDUCE OUR IMPACT

FINCANTIERI GROUP e

 

We want to play an active role towards a more sustainable economy and
society. We are committed to monitoring and reducing our direct impacts

 

and contributing to limiting global warming with our greener ships, a
responsible supply chain and by engaging in dialogue and collaboration

with agencies and institutions

In a world where natural resources are, by
their very nature, limited, where people are
highly mobile and that is subject to climate
change, companies are called on to implement
appropriate mitigation and adaptation
methods in order to address these phenomena
and create value in the long term.

The aspects linked to climate change are both

a source of risk and an opportunity. For this
reason, we seek to monitor them constantly
and to analyse them with the dual purpose
of, on the one hand, identifying all the risks
for which it is appropriate to adopt mitigation
and/or adaptation measures and, on the
other, exploiting opportunities to develop the
business and improve efficiency.

 

We want to reduce our environmental impact
through responsible resource management
and sustainable patterns of production and
consumption, protecting the biodiversity of the
territories where we operate.

OUR COMMITMENTS TOWARDS AN ECO-SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY

 

* Action to raise energy efficiency and reduce
carbon dioxide (CO,) and other pollutant
emissions

* Conservation of natural resources,
biodiversity, and reduction of environmental
impact

* Increase employee awareness of
environmental impact and promote virtuous
behaviour

* Development of ecologically sustainable
products and services with the aim of contributing
to acircular and low carbon economy

* Promotion and support of a responsible and
sustainable supply chain that shares our values
and is based on long-lasting relationships
founded on integrity, transparency and respect

* Support for research to improve the analysis
and management of risks associated with
climate change

 

 

 

Therefore, we look for options that allow us to
reduce the direct impact of our operations and
the indirect impact associated with the value
chain that characterizes our business.

* 20% reduction of Scope 2 GHG emissions
by 2020

* ISO 50001 - Energy Management System
certification

* Increase the portion of electricity from
renewable sources

*« Awareness campaign

* Development of technological solutions that
enable energy savings to be increased for
ships with the same features (green ships)

* Definition of an eco-design to promote the
development of environmentally sustainable
ships

* Research projects to develop new solutions
for energy savings or reduction of emissions
in collaboration with research institutes /
universities on issues associated with climate
risks
