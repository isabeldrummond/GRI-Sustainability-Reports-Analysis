The data refer to the entire Fincantieri Group.

In an increasingly complex labour market,
where there is a growing professional
mismatch between supply and demand for
profiles with technical and technological
skills, we work constantly to make selection
processes better and more effective and

to enhance our recruiting and employer
branding policies and strategies. Our
employer branding strategies are translated
into an increasingly active presence on social
networks, including LinkedIn and Instagram,
and above all through a synergistic network
of education and training actors, at national
and international level, which see the
involvement of secondary schools, Istituti
Tecnici Superiori Foundations (ITS - Higher
Technical Colleges), universities and business
schools, with the aim of promoting the
development of knowledge and skills sought
and applied in the Company.

 

 

Partnerships with universities

In order to have a direct and constant
contact with students and teachers,

we actively participate in “Career Days”
organized by universities and various local
institutions, we promote meeting days with
university students dedicated to introducing
the Company (‘Meet Fincantieri”), we carry
out moments of learning with seminars,
classroom testimonials, orientation sessions,
as well as guided tours for students and
school classes at construction sites and
technical departments. We have several
conventions in place to support the
development of teaching, scientific research
and higher education at university and post-
graduate level. In particular, Fincantieri has
collaborated in and promoted the Cassa
Depositi Prestiti (CDP) MBA master’s degree
at the Luiss Business School in Rome,
reserved for employees of the CDP group.
We are also collaborating in the design

of the MIND - Management & Innovation
Design - master’s degree with the Scuola

 

Superiore Sant’Anna in Pisa and the first
level university master’s degree in nautical
and naval Interior Design with the University
of Trieste.

In 2019 Fincantieri was
awarded the Universum
prize as Most Attractive
Employers among
companies in the
Industrial Engineering
and Manufacturing sector
according to STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering & Mathematics) student
rankings of the leading Italian universities.
In 2019, Fincantieri won the Universum
award as Best Employer for STEM
professionals, professionals with up to five
years’ experience, among companies in the
Industrial Engineering sector.

 

Technical institutes and ITS Foundations

In 2019, we intensified our relationship

with secondary educational institutions to
ensure the training of qualified resources
with profiles that allow them to be easily
employed in typical roles in the shipbuilding
industry, both within the Group and in
satellite companies. The main collaborations
activated with a view to supporting
orientation and employment are given below.

* Technical institutes and vocational schools:

we have launched various initiatives in
collaboration with technical colleges
and vocational schools, such as the IFTS

FINCANTIERI GROUP e

course (Higher Technical Education and
Training) for ship designers in Monfalcone,
the course for Process Technician for
Shipbuilding in Genoa and the two
editions of the “Ship Master” courses in

La Spezia and Sestri Levante. To support
the expansion of the training offered by
institutions in the Ligurian capital, we have
joined the TecnOrientarsi Memorandum of
Understanding, signed in October between
Confindustria Genova and the network

of professional colleges. We also offer
work-study opportunities, as part of the
PCTO (Paths for Cross-functional Skills
and Orientation), to students at technical
colleges located in the territories where we
have our sites.

ITS Foundations: in accordance with the
Memorandum of Understanding signed

in May 2018 with the MIUR, we have
expanded our collaboration activities

with the Higher Technical College (ITS)
Foundations, thanks to our managers’
teaching posts, company visits and
internships for students. On this point,
during 2019 we designed a new course
with the Merchant Marine Academy for
senior technicians for the supervision and
installation of on-board systems. Further
initiatives are being launched which will
affect territories with a lower rate of
development.
