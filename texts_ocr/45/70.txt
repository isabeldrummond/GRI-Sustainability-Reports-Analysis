FINCANTIERI GROUP

OHSAS 18001 / ISO 45001 and SA 8000
certifications

During 2019, we continued implementing
and consolidating the occupational

health and safety management systems

in our operating units (65% of sites are
certified), with the aim of supporting the
implementation of the policy adopted by the
Company.

In 2019, eight Italian sites completed the
migration process to the new ISO 45001
standard and we plan to complete the
transition of the remainder by 2020. In
parallel, the surveillance activity by the
accredited certification body to maintain the
existing Management systems continues
The Palermo shipyard has achieved the first
OHSAS 18001 certification in accordance
with the requirements of the reference
standard while the subsidiary Isotta

 

Fraschini Motori has achieved the first ISO
45001 certification in accordance with the
relevant requirements

The US site of Fincantieri Marinette Marine,
already previously certified in compliance
with OHSAS 18001, has planned to migrate
its health and safety at work management
system to the ISO 45001 standard during
2020

The VARD group maintained OHSAS 18001
certification for the Romanian Braila and
Tulcea shipyards, as well as the Vietnamese
Vung Tau shipyard.

All VARD shipyards are aligned with SA
8000 standards, which are based on the
International Labour Organization (ILO)
conventions and the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (Vung Tau is also certified)

WELL-BEING FOR OUR PEOPLE

We have implemented a welfare model that
is able to positively affect the welfare of our
people and, at the same time, capture the
most modern dynamics of the labour market
and the business

The welfare tools, defined with the corporate
agreement in 2016, are aimed at employees
in general of Fincantieri S.p.A., including
part-time and fixed term employees, and are
also recognized for the employees of Italian
subsidiaries and/or associates falling under
the application of the supplementary labour
agreement

Within the welfare system, the Social Bonus
is particularly important because of its
characteristics. The bonus is paid annually
and exclusively in welfare services and any
unused bonus amounts are automatically
allocated to the individual employee’s
supplementary pension fund. To strengthen
the connection between the achievement
of production objectives and consolidation
of the overall welfare system, employees
who decide to convert variable bonuses
into welfare are paid a further increase of
10% on the value converted. In 2019, 25%

of the overall performance Bonus was
converted into welfare services. For an
employee to benefit from company welfare,
we have a special portal through which

the employee can access a wide range of
goods and services. The most requested
services were those intended for the family,
in particular for the training of children and
assistance to family members, together with
welfare vouchers, which can be spent in
establishments with which the employees
themselves have often asked the Company
to arrange special prices. The supplementary

FINCANTIERI GROUP

pension and health programme, which

are complementary to the measures

already defined in terms of supplementary
pensions and healthcare, the National
Collective Bargaining Agreement (CCNL)
and the company’s supplementary labour
agreement, were also highly appreciated
The portal also provides other categories

of services such as training courses, travel
and holidays, mortgage repayments, leisure,
sport and wellness

As regards welfare policies, particular
attention has been paid to public transport
and mobility issues, with an eye on
sustainability. The employee can request the
total or partial reimbursement of the ticket,
such as the season ticket for the bus or train,
for themselves and/or for their dependent
family members.

Confirming the validity of the welfare model
it has adopted, Fincantieri - having previously
won the Welfare Awards 2018 for the best
plan in application of the National Collective
Bargaining Agreement for Steelworkers

and for welfare policies aimed at blue collar
employees - won the Welfare Award for the
Best Welfare Network Plan 2019 due to the
territorial extension of the welfare system.

Again with a view to generating positive
repercussions in terms of environmental
sustainability, during 2019 the promotion
campaign for the use of corporate car
pooling (namely two or more people sharing
a private car for the commute to and from
work) was implemented and provided for
incentives and the recognition of bonuses

In order to respond to the growing need

for work-life balance, we continued to
