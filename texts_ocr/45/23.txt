The Board of Directors is also the company
body responsible for proper enactment of
he Policy, that relies on the support of the
Remuneration Committee, which acts to
provide consultancy and proposals

The adequacy, overall consistency, and
concrete application of the Remuneration
Policy are evaluated by the Remuneration
Committee, as recommended by the
Corporate Governance Code and as indicated
in the regulations for the Committee. The
Remuneration Committee consists of four
non-executive members, three of whom

are independent and at least one of whom
has adequate knowledge and experience in
inance or pay policy, evaluated by the Board
of Directors when nominated

The parties covered by the Remuneration
Policy are the Chief Executive Officer, the
Chairman, the General Manager, Executives
with Strategic Responsibilities and other Key
Executives

Management of the Remuneration Policy

is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer,
supported by the Human Resources

and Industrial Relations Management.
Verification of the qualitative and quantitative
performance objectives and consequent

 

determination of any sums of money due

to the interested parties is performed
following approval of the financial statements
for the year following verification by the
Chief Executive Officer. The Remuneration

Policy is aimed at achieving the Company’s
strategic priorities and enhancing sustainable
performance.

In continuation of the LT! Plan 2016-2018,

on 27 March 2018, the Board of Directors
approved the LT! Plan 2019-2021 which
essentially follows the same structure though
with the addition of another objective
associated with sustainability.

The creation of sustainable value in the
medium to long term, alignment of the
interests of management with those of

the shareholders and support for retention
capacity are the primary objectives of

this Plan, in line with the indications in the
Corporate Governance Code and the best and
most widespread market practices.
