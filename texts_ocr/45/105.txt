Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control

We are independent in accordance with the principles of ethics and independence set out in the Code
of Ethics for Professional Accountants published by the International Ethics Standards Board for
Accountants, which are based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, competence and
professional diligence, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our audit firm adopts the
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly, maintains an overall
quality control system which includes processes and procedures for compliance with ethical and
professional principles and with applicable laws and regulations.

Auditor’s responsibilities

Weare responsible for expressing a conclusion, on the basis of the work performed, regarding the
compliance of the NFS with the Decree and with the GRI Standards. We conducted our engagement in
accordance with the “International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) —
Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”
(hereafter “ISAE 3000 Revised”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards
Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and apply
procedures in order to obtain limited assurance that the NFS is free of material misstatement. The
procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in scope than those performed in a
reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised and, therefore, do not
provide us with a sufficient level of assurance that we have become aware of all significant facts and
circumstances that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.

The procedures performed on the NFS were based on our professional judgement and consisted in
interviews, primarily with company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information
presented in the NFS, analysis of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to obtain
evidence considered useful.

In particular, we performed the following procedures:

1. analysis of the relevant matters reported in the NFS relating to the activities and
characteristics of the Group, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process used
in accordance with article 3 of the Decree and with the reporting standard adopted;

2. analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area, in order to
assess their compliance with the Decree;

3. comparison of the financial information reported in the NFS with the information reported in
the Fincantieri Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements;

4. understanding of the following matters:

- _ business and organisational model of the Group, with reference to the management of the
matters specified by article 3 of the Decree;

— policies adopted by the Group with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the
Decree, actual results and related key performance indicators;

- main risks, generated and/or faced by the Group, with reference to the matters specified
in article 3 of the Decree.

With reference to those matters, we compared the information obtained with the information

presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described under point 5 a) below;
