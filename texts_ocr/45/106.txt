significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the NFS. In particular, we held
meetings and interviews with the management of Fincantieri SpA, Vard Tulcea SA, Fincantieri
Marine Group LLC, Fincantieri Marine Systems North America Inc and Isotta Fraschini
Motori SpA and we performed limited analysis of documentary evidence, to gather
information about the processes and procedures for the collection, consolidation, processing
and submission of the non-financial information to the function responsible for the
preparation of the NFS.

Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group:

particular to the business model, the policies adopted and the main risks, we
carried out interviews and acquired supporting documentation to verify their
consistency with availableevidence;

b) with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical procedures as
well as limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the accuracy of
consolidation of the information;

- for the following companies, divisions and sites: Fincantieri SpA (Head Office -Trieste
and Castellammare di Stabia site, Italy) Fincantieri Marine Group LLC (Head Office -
Green Bay, registered office and site, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin), Vard Tulcea SA
(registered office and site, Tulcea, Romania) and Isotta Fraschini Motori SpA
(registered office and site, Bari, Italy) , which were selected on the basis of their
activities, their contribution to the performance indicators at a consolidated level and
their location, we carried out site visits during which we met local management and
gathered supporting documentation regarding the correct application of the
procedures and calculation methods used for the key performance indicators.

Conclusions
Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS

of the Fincantieri Group as of 31 December 2019 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in
compliance with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and with the GRI Standards.
