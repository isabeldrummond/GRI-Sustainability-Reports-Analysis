FINCANTIERI GROUP

Fostering employment and integration, including through the promotion of

Xf? educational and training programmes

 

Our goal is to:

* facilitate the matching of labour supply and demand;

* activate a virtuous circle and an ever closer bond with local communities;
* create opportunities for growth and enhance the skills of people and businesses.

We are committed to creating a pool of suitably trained personnel to stimulate the Fincantieri

system, particularly with reference to the supply chain, in order to cope with workloads

With this in mind we are developing, together with regional and municipal administrations,

several initiatives, such as specific pre-employment courses and recruitment days, in which

the satellite businesses took part in the search for specialized personnel. These initiatives
involved, as a priority, unemployed people or non-workers as a result of businesses that

suffered economic crisis in the territory.

We work continuously to promote the Professional Training System related to the maritime

economy by participating in Higher Technical Colleges (ITS) and Higher Technical Education (IFTS).
