Water discharges and heavy metals

As regards water discharges, in accordance
with the authorization profiles of the different
production sites, sampling and laboratory
analysis are conducted regularly to monitor
the quality of the discharges and guarantee
that the limits laid down by the law for
analytes (heavy metals in particular) which are
subject to monitoring.

With a view to continuous improvement,

we are revising the current plant layouts at
the various production sites, while new and
technologically more advanced solutions are
already being implemented.

Raw materials

Procurement of raw materials has a strategic
role for the Company.

In recent years we have given more
significance to the selection of materials in
order to reduce their environmental impact
as much as possible.

As best described in the section on eco-
design, even while preparing specific
contractual techniques, and consequently
those needed for the procurement process,
we work to identify materials for the interiors
that, though possessing the same technical,
qualitative and compliance characteristics,
are also environmentally compatible.

The main raw materials present in the
production cycle are:

@ iron for the hull;
* copper for the electric wiring and

automation;
¢ steel, iron, plastics and other iron and non-
iron alloys for the piping installed on board;
¢ welding materials;
® paint products.

In line with the contents of the Policy
regarding the use of chemical products, the
supply choices, where there are equivalent
technical characteristics and/or compatible
performance, have been oriented towards
products with a lower environmental impact.
For the most commonly used paint products
in shipbuilding, joint initiatives have been
carried out with the major suppliers on the
market to identify low-solvent or water-
based alternatives.

“The data for 2018 have been revised for comparison purposes following the inclusion of
data for the VARD group.

The data refer to the entire Fincantieri Group, except for the procurement of ferrous
materials and nitrogen which concern Fincantieri S.p.A. and Fincantieri Marine Group.

Most of the materials used for the hull

are ferrous and are therefore by their

nature reusable. Steel is a 100% recyclable
material and it can be recycled countless
times without losing any of its original
properties. This product is therefore never
consumed, but continuously transformed
through recycling processes that make it a
permanent material, a concept underpinning
the circular economy.

Waste

The criteria identified for managing
processing residues and waste disposal are
included in the guidelines revised in 2019,
which provide for the development of a
production unit procedure to manage the
site’s specificities.

Waste produced by our activities is
delivered to authorized sites according to
its classification and, in line with the policies
adopted by the Group, recovery destinations
are favoured and maximized.
