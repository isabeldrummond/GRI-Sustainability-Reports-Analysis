ioe Protecting health and promoting research

 

Our contribution primarily consists of initiatives to support the medical-scientific sector or
to support the sick. We are convinced that it is only through scientific research that we can
improve people’s quality of life and prospects, because health protection is an ethical and

social value of primary importance

WE DIALOGUE WITH COMMUNITIES AND
INSTITUTIONS

Our structure and international presence
throughout the world brings with it dialogue
with very different realities and requires that
we have in-depth knowledge of the territory
and the needs of stakeholders with the aim
of effectively resoonding to demands and
define priorities.

The relationship and dialogue with local
communities is managed internally at Parent
Company level through the Central and
Local Administration Relations function

This function represents

* our direct line with Institutions and Public
Administrations and we use it to channel all
the requests from and to local areas;

* the Fincantieri Group and all our associates

 

FINCANTIERI GROUP e

before Parliament, the Government and
national institutions whose actions could
have a direct or indirect impact on society,
through symmetrical relations with its
counterparties

Our approach is aimed at transparency by
representing the interests of the Group, as a
whole, and in full institutional respect for the
roles of our counterparties.

We have built a process based on mutual
trust, presenting the Company’s perspective
before public decision-makers, supporting
our arguments, also through the preparation
of position papers always supported by a
legal/regulatory and scientific foundation.
