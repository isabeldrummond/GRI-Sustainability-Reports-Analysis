FINCANTIERI GROUP

working group on product and process
digitalization;

¢ the Cooperative Research Ships
consortium, which focuses on the study
of hydrodynamic, structural and general
issues related to large ships interpreted
both from an operational and design point
of view;

e European Council for Maritime Applied
R&D (ECMAR), sector association that
aims to develop a common strategy for
European research in the maritime sector.

As part of our Italian activities, we have
contributed to the work of the Trasporti
Italia 2020 NTC and the formation of the
Blue Italian Growth NTC. During 2019,
following a participatory process, both
clusters published their action plans for the
three-year period 2019-2021. Fincantieri
actively contributed to the drafting of these
plans, whose contents were transferred into
the contribution that the two associations
made to the National Research Programme
(NRP) drafting committee.

At the Italian level, we also collaborate with
AIRI, the Italian Association for Industrial
Research, contributing to the definition of
the technical analysis documents, which are
often taken as a reference for evaluating
actions that support innovation, which are
activated by public administrations

Over the year Fincantieri contributed,
through its representatives in the Italian
regional technological districts, to the
analysis of the context and local application
of the sector’s development strategies,
contributing, in particular, to the definition
of intelligent development strategies (S3)

of the regional territories in which the
Company is located. The districts involved in
cooperation relationships with the Group are:

e Maritime Technology Cluster Friuli Venezia
Giulia (MareTC FVG);

e Distretto Ligure delle Tecnologie Marine
(DLTM);

e Distretto Tecnologico Ligure sui Sistemi
Intelligenti Integrati (SIIT);

e Distretto sull'ingegneria dei Materiali
polimerici e composti e Strutture (IMAST);

e Distretto Tecnologico sui Trasporti Navali,
Commerciali e da Diporto (NAVTEC).

Norway: the main partnerships

The Group benefits from the relationships
that the subsidiary VARD maintains with

the Norwegian academic and research
world. Partnerships are active with the
NTNU - the Norwegian University of Science
and Technology - and the SINTEF - The
Foundation for Industrial and Technical
Research. The latter currently represents one
of the main independent research centres in
northern Europe

This close cooperation has led to the
establishment of two centres for research-
based Innovation (SFI):

¢ Smart Marine SFI: the centre’s main focus
is to increase the potential of the
Norwegian maritime sector within the
segment of sustainable waterborne
transport;

¢ Move SFI: the centre's activities are
focused on increasing the value of
maritime operations by developing IT
knowledge, methods and tools

In addition, VARD has recently joined the
Joint Industry Project (JIP), the Open
Simulation Platform, with the aim of creating
an open source digital platform to be used
during the develooment of new ships

United States: the National Shipbuilding
Research Program

The American subsidiary Marinette Marine
actively collaborates with research centres
and universities, through the National

FINCANTIERI GROUP

Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP)
funded by the US Government in order to
carry out research and innovation initiatives
The NSRP project, founded in collaboration
with U.S. Shipyards, studies and develops
new processes and designs to improve ship
production in the United States and make it
more efficient. The activities carried out in
this context range from welding techniques
to design for maintenance concepts, via the
study of strategies to reduce ship weight
and the implementation of innovative
coating solutions.
