FINCANTIERI GROUP

 

The 2019 financial year saw the publication
of our third Sustainability Report. For

our Group, a new phase of further
improvement is opening up, in which the
issues Of corporate responsibility have been
introduced into business processes and are
becoming increasingly harmonized with
them. The stated objective is, of course, to
promote and consolidate a strong culture
of sustainability in a planned way, reflecting
Fincantieri's strategic vision

Last year, as part of this virtuous path,
we published the Sustainability Plan, a
truly fundamental milestone, with which
we stated our long-term commitments
over a five-year period, and we achieved
all the objectives for 2019. A further step
was taken by joining the United Nations
Global Compact, the world’s largest
business sustainability initiative. The
scheme involves voluntary adherence to

ten universal principles relating to human
rights, labour, the environment and the
fight against corruption, through political
actions, business practices and social and
civil behaviour. Fincantieri is the largest
shipbuilder, and the first cruise shipbuilder,
to adopt these principles in its strategy.

This important result on the external front
was immediately followed by another
equally important one internally. We refer
to the “Fincantieri for the green future”
campaign, aimed at increasing awareness of
environmental sustainability among all our
stakeholders, primarily involving our own
employees as well as contractor personnel,
to encourage them to make a positive and
tangible contribution to environmental
protection through their behaviour in
everyday life, not just in the workplace.

Let’s review some of the most important
actions pursued during the year just ended.
In the field of Research and Innovation, 2019
saw us spearheading two agreements of
prime national importance. The first, with
Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), our main
shareholder, and Snam, in the key sectors
for the development of port facilities in Italy
and sustainable technologies for maritime
transport, in line with the Proposal for an
Integrated National Plan for Energy and
Climate (PNIEC). The second, again with
CDP, together with Eni, lays the foundations
for establishing a company to develop

and build power stations that use waves

to produce electricity. We also presented,

in collaboration with the National

Research Council (CNR), the results of six
multidisciplinary research projects funded

by the Ministry of Infrastructure and
Transport for innovation in the naval field.

Our commitment to innovation also sees us
engaging as partners of leading institutions
of higher education. In fact, we have
signed an extensive agreement to establish
new cooperative relationships in the civil,
industrial and information engineering
sectors with the University of Calabria, one
of the largest universities in the South of
Italy, which will allow us to tap into a pool
of excellence in terms of academic and
research standards, with students ready
to take advantage of the opportunities
that the Company can offer in Italy and
abroad. Moreover, our subsidiary Issel Nord,
which specializes in logistics engineering
and high added value services, has been
working with the University of Genoa-
Polo Guglielmo Marconi to develop the
"Integrated Product Support and Lifecycle
anagement” course: a new opportunity
or students of Master’s degree courses
in Mechanical Engineering - Design and
Production and Yacht Design, which has
obtained the direct patronage of the
Product Support & Specifications Group
of ASD, the AeroSpace and Defence
ndustries Association of Europe, and will
also concern the software tools developed
by our Company. In agreement with the
Liguria Region, we have also helped to
aunch the “Senior technician for the
production and maintenance of means
of transport and related infrastructure”
course at the Accademia della Marina
ercantile (Merchant Navy Academy). All
these initiatives concretely demonstrate the
Group's desire to create greater synergy

between the training offered by universities
and the needs of employers, to improve the
quality of training and research processes
and to offer young people a series of
academic paths with innovative content to
prepare them for entry into the world of
work

Young people are therefore a resource

to be invested in with determination, but
are certainly not the only target for our
ambitious and worthwhile projects. Our
reference communities, i.e. the populations
of the areas where we are present, are in
turn essential partners, and we constantly
promote proactive initiatives to improve
their welfare, as well as the wellbeing of
our employees and their families. Among
the many projects of this type, we want

to mention the extension of our charitable
projects to include local Food Banks for
the recovery of food surpluses in Bari and
Ancona, after starting similar projects

in the Ligurian shipyards. Last summer,
together with the Municipality of Genoa,
we inaugurated a summer centre that
welcomed not only the children of our
employees but also the rest of the city.
Finally, we have signed an agreement

with the Municipality of Monfalcone for
the construction of a nursery school,
committing ourselves to renovate a
building owned by the Municipality, with
an investment totally at our expense of
euro 1 million, in addition to the payment of
management and consumption costs up to
a maximum amount of euro 300,000 per
year for the first three years.
