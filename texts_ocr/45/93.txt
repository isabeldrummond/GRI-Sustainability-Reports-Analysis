WE RAISE OUR PARTNERS’ AWARENESS OF
ECO-SUSTAINABILITY

We ask our suppliers to share our approach
to sustainability in order to achieve one of
our most important corporate objectives:
having a responsible and sustainable supply
chain.

We want to represent a model of excellence
also in terms of environmental protection
and this is why we have a binding
environmental policy for all our employees
and for all external companies operating in
our production sites. We are committed to
the implementation and maintenance of an
Environmental Management System at our
sites and obtaining ISO 14001 certification
for most of them. We expect all our suppliers

to align themselves with this approach,

sharing principles and commitments on
environmental protection, with the common
goal of achieving a sustainable supply chain
while minimizing environmental impact. For
this reason we have adopted the Suppliers’
Code of Ethics that includes among its
pillars the protection of and respect for
the environment. Suppliers are asked

to share the principles contained in the

document with their employees, subsidiaries,

collaborators and subcontractors, with a
view to encouraging virtuous behaviour
throughout the supply chain.

For more information on the supply chain, please refer to the
chapter “For a sustainable supply chain”.

 

TOGETHER FOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE
ENVIRONMENT

Respect for the environment, for local territories
and for the people with whom we share areas
and activities are essential elements in order
to ensure the continuity and growth of our
Group over time and to the benefit of future
generations.

Therefore, we are directly involved in the
development of international regulations and
we conduct our business in close collaboration
with the flag agency, classification societies,
the sector’s industrial associations, shipping
companies and the main international research
bodies.

Research plays a particularly important role in
the fight against climate change. Therefore, the

Sustainability Plan includes a specific objective
that provides for the activation of partnerships
with universities/research institutes in

order to develop new solutions for energy
efficiency or reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions. In particular, a project was launched
in 2019 to study proposals for regulations
allowing the use of fuel cells on board ships,
with particular focus on passenger ships.
Fincantieri also presented a project proposal
called GreenCruise to the Italian Ministry for
Economic Development to study and develop
prototypes of power generation solutions
using alternative fuels (e.g. LNG and fuel cells).
This second project is awaiting evaluation by

 

FINCANTIERI GROUP @ -----+------++-:

the Ministry’s technical experts.

As part of our Research and Innovation
projects, we have launched several

initiatives within the framework of European
collaborations to study strategies to reduce
the environmental impact of our products,

in particular, with reference to the initiatives
underway to contribute to the SDG 14
objective - life below water, studies are being
carried out to reduce underwater noise caused
by our products, even though there are no
strict regulations on this issue.

An agreement was signed between
Fincantieri, Eni, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, and
Terna with the aim of developing energy
systems with reduced environmental impact.
Experimentation of a system that uses wave
motion to produce electricity is part of this
approach.

We also believe in the value of transparency
in reporting and we are guiding change in this
direction. As proof of this, in 2016 we joined
the CDP Climate Change Programme, a
prestigious British organization whose goal is
to improve the management of environmental
risks by leveraging information transparency.
The programme asks the world’s largest
companies from all sectors to participate

in an annual survey of their approach to
managing their environmental risks and of the
results they achieved. The extensive database
resulting from this survey is made available to
stakeholders.

In 2019, the Fincantieri Group obtained the

B rating, on a scale ranging from the minimum
D to the maximum A, which testifies to the
effectiveness of the actions it has taken in the
fight against climate change.
