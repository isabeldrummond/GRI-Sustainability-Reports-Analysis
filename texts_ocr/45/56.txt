@ FINCANTIERI GROUP

A cruise ship is an ideal and self-sufficient
floating city in constant communication
with land. It is designed, built and managed
to respect the ecosystems of the areas in
which it must operate and to safeguard the
health and life of those temporarily living
there for work or fun, thousands of people
from different countries and cultures, who
live together and adhere to its rules of
governance.

We oversee all stages of production,
including design, supplier selection,
construction, commissioning, testing and
delivery.

The ships designed and built by the Group
are not standard vessels; each one is a
tailor-made product that reflects the
specific needs of the customer. In addition,
we carry out activities to develop applied

  

technological and innovative solutions

Cin particular in the areas of safety, noise
reduction, stability and ship operating
speed) and the results they yield can be
used in the ship design. In this sense, each
ship can be considered a new product as it
is the result of the combination of specific
design activities in response to customer
needs and of research and innovation
activities.

The Group offers a diversified product
portfolio, which includes ships of very
different sizes, from 10,000 to 175,000 gross
tonnage and with a length between 110 and
345 metres, characterized by the diversity
and richness of the fittings in the hotel

part and the entertainment services offered
to meet the needs of all types

of customers.

The Group is directly involved in the
development of international regulations
for safety and our activities are carried

out in close collaboration with the flag
agency, classification bodies, the sector’s
industrial associations, shipping companies
and the main international research bodies.
Monitoring of regulatory developments

is therefore a fundamental element, at a
strategic and technological level, in the early
identification of possible trends in the market
and of the emergence of new needs by
proposing solutions that are innovative and
competitive at product level and comply with
the technical, economic and environmental
feasibility standards at process level.

We are an accredited representative with
the IMO, the specialized Agency at global
level for issuing directives on maritime safety
and environmental protection. The main
conventions between the IMO’s member
states are aimed at:

* improving maritime security (mostly from a
safety point of view) - SOLAS;

¢ limiting the pollution of the seas - MARPOL;

* standardizing maritime labour rules - ILO.

Commercial ships, including cruise ships,
must have a valid class certificate, issued
after verification that they comply with the
regulations of a classification body. The
primary aim of the classification body is to
ensure that ships are designed, constructed
and maintained in such a way as to
minimize the risks to life, the environment
and property. Achievement of the class
demonstrates that all the controls in the
various phases of the ship’s life have been
successful.

All equipment and appliances installed

on board follow the manufacturer’s or
internationally recognized standards.
Other regulations are determined locally,

In particular, the SOLAS (Safety Of Life At
Sea) Convention aims to specify common
international standards in order to safeguard
human life at sea, establishing safety
standards for technical aspects and for

the preparedness of personnel in case of
emergency. All ships produced must comply
with these rules, which are constantly
evolving.

Service (USPHS).

In addition to being a product designed to
be safe, ships are designed and built for
the comfort of everyone on board, whether
passengers or crew members. There are
also dedicated relaxation areas, which may
include swimming pools, bars, gyms or
discos for crew members.

The ships are designed to make more and
more spaces accessible to people with
disabilities, for example by providing easy
