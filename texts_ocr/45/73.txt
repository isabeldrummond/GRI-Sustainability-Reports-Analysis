WE LISTEN TO OUR PEOPLE

We believe that dialogue and listening are
essential for creating relationships based on
trust and transparency, which is why we have
developed the following listening initiatives
over the years.

As part of our develooment
and improvement initiatives,
we have launched the
Fincantieri for the Future project in Italy with
the aim of developing and implementing

an organic path of management change

at all levels, which is needed in order

to best respond to current and future
competitive challenges. The first step of the
project saw the active engagement of and
listening to workers through an anonymous
questionnaire aimed at identifying the
organizational climate, people’s expectations
and their suggestions.

 

The results obtained from this
first survey were the starting
point for designing, planning
and implementing improvement actions

in response to the objective evidence that
emerged, the so-called “change shipyards”.
With the aim of promoting the exchange

of opinions, confrontation and dialogue,
considered fundamental tools for the growth
of people and the organization as a whole,
we shared the results that emerged and the
contents of the “change shipyards” launched
during dedicated meetings held in all
production units, divisions, departments and
Italian subsidiaries, which involved more than
6,500 resources. Using the same procedure
as the first step, a monitoring process was

 

 

set up to review the new change initiatives
and collect people’s suggestions, with a view
to continuous improvement through a new
survey that recorded a higher response rate
than the previous year (+7%)

@®The evidence that emerged,
including the growing

 

 

- awareness of the need

for change and how it is a living and vital
process within the Company, as well as

a strong and increased pride in working

at Fincantieri, was shared during 2018 in
meetings with employees, who were able

to actively participate in the project also
through a direct dialogue with management.
An external eyewitness attended the
meetings and brought practical examples

of the connection between values and
behaviour in the world of work. After this
meeting, various working groups were
established aimed at defining the Group
Conduct Agreement, which translates the
corporate values, defined during the first
stage of the project, into actual behaviours
that can be observed and translated into
everyday life

Again with the aim of “putting people at the
core’, disseminating the culture, corporate
values and all the initiatives launched as part
of the change management project, we set
up a network of internal facilitators, Group
employees who, owing to their personality,
aptitude and natural inclination, can facilitate
the change process, stimulate everyday
participation at all levels, leveraging on
formal and informal occasions, with the aim
of making everyone aware that they each can
and must be an active part in the change

: . @The project was given a

/ green perspective with the
launch of Fincantieri for
the Green Future, a new initiative that aims
to raise awareness and bring employees

 

closer to environmental issues, making
them protagonists of a path of continuous
improvement. Fincantieri for the Green
Future is a call to action, an invitation and
an incentive to make a tangible contribution
to environmental protection with virtuous
behaviour, small daily actions, simple
gestures and attention to waste, starting
with greater awareness and sensitivity to
environmental sustainability in the Company.
With the aim of promoting environmental
sustainability not only as an opportunity,
but as a real mission, the second edition

of FincantieriON will be launched in 2020.
The initiative, aimed at all employees, aims
to promote the collection of innovative
ideas that may suggest the introduction

of materials, system and organizational
solutions and, more generally, a process of
change that can bring about continuous
improvement within the Company with a
view to sustainability so that the resource
exploitation, technological develooment and
investment management are increasingly
compatible with protecting the environment
and the creation of long-term value
