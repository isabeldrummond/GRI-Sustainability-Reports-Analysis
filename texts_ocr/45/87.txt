FINCANTIERI GROUP

Enterprises’ NOx-Fund, whose primary
objective is to reduce emissions of NOx.

Fincantieri’s production sites are individually
subject to environmental permits that
prescribe specific limits on the maximum
consumption and total emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) into the
atmosphere. Compliance with these limits
is pursued, even when production volumes
are increasing, by planning a gradual
replacement of the products used with
alternatives with a lower solvent content
and by adopting appropriate system
measures to reduce emissions. These include
the installation of new sandblasting and
painting facilities and, most recently, the
one that has been operational since 2017 at
the Monfalcone shipyard that is equipped
with a post-combustion system and allows
the elimination of VOCs emitted during
processing

VOC emissions relating to Fincantieri
S.p.A.’s production units, in proportion to
the production volume, have improved
significantly since 2017.

WE INVEST FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

ENVIRONMENTAL
INVESTMENTS

To conserve resources in 2019, we have
invested 10.5 million euros in environmental
protection, around 33% more than in 2018

Fincantieri S.o.A. has for years been
committed to implementing measures aimed
at continuously improving the impact on

all environmental compartments. The main
ones involved the systems for collecting

and treating rainwater, noise containment
measures related to production and systems
for extracting and treating welding fumes and
new system measures for sandblasting and
painting

These latter work primarily involved the
Monfalcone shipyard, in line with the
improvement programme set up with

the issue of the Integrated Environmental
Authorization.

On the other hand, at the Muggiano, Riva
Trigoso and Palermo shipyards, work was
carried out on the extraction and treatment
systems for welding fumes.

In the field of runoff water management,
works were carried out to upgrade the
rainwater collection systems in the quayside
area in Sestri Ponente and to optimize the first
rainwater treatment plants in the Marghera
and Palermo shipyards are particularly
important. Finally, the Arsenale Triestino San
Marco has completed construction of the
runoff water collection system and has agreed
with the operator to feed it into a special
network for subsequent treatment

WE PROTECT BIODIVERSITY

We promote the efficient use of natural
resources and the protection of biodiversity,
identifying potential impacts and mitigation
actions, since safeguarding the natural value
of the areas surrounding the shipyards,
where the Company’s production is located,
is of primary importance for Fincantieri.

To protect these places, specific and special
precautions are put in place in accordance
with local legislation and activities that could
directly or indirectly concern the protected
area are carefully monitored

The production sites in Muggiano (surface
area of 147,000 m2), Riva Trigoso (surface
area 173,000 m7?) and Sestri Ponente
(surface area 237,500 m?) are inside an
International Marine Protected Area - Marine
Mammal Sanctuary, which was established
with the intent to safeguard various kinds of
marine life.

The production site at Marghera (surface
area 370,000 m2), which is on the Venetian
lagoon, is also considered part of the
UNESCO site - Venice and its Lagoon

In the United States Fincantieri Marinette
Marine is positioned next to the Menomonee,
in Wisconsin (for a surface area of 21,315
m?). The river in question is an area to be
protected, especially due to the quality

of the waters, the marshland and the
ecosystem of aquatic flora and fauna.

As regards the VARD group, the Tulcea
shipyard, in Romania (for a surface area

of about 750,000 m7), is adjacent to

the Danube Delta, an area protected by
UNESCO. The ISO 14001 certification,
obtained in 2012, certifies the presence of
the protections required to safeguard the
site.

 

VARD Promar, in Brazil, occupies a surface
area of about 800,000 m? and part of it
(250,000 m7?) is adjacent to the mangrove
forest, considered by WWF to be a biome,
that is, one of the fourteen major types of
habitat into which the Earth is divided. Also
in this case, specific and special precautions
are put in place in accordance with local
legislation
