structural changes in many industrial sectors,

resulting in the emergence of new markets,
growth and employment opportunities

but also to the need to adapt the business
model in order to seize all the opportunities

In this context, our business model -
diversified by end markets, geographical
areas and customer portfolio - is able to face
new challenges by seizing all opportunities
without ignoring their social and
environmental implications. Our goal always
remains that of combining business with
reducing environmental impact, meeting the
needs of local communities and improving
the safety of our people and our suppliers

We are committed to developing and
promoting innovative solutions that
contribute to the achievement of the UN
2030 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), through a structured organization,
the activation of virtuous ecosystems, and
by leveraging on access to new technologies

With this in mind, we are also actively
involved in the construction of the new
Genoa Bridge, a project that Fincantieri
Infrastructure manages together with

Salini Impregilo, a leading partner and
company in the sector with which it set up
the consortium PERGENOVA. The latter’s
mission is to give back to the city of Genoa
the viaduct over the Polcevera river, which
collapsed following the tragedy on 14 August
2018. Fincantieri Infrastructure contributes
in this case by pooling the entire know-how
of the Fincantieri Group: the Valeggio sul
Mincio shipyard produces the metal sheets,
beams and semi-finished products which
are then assembled at the Castellammare
di Stabia and Sestri Ponente shipyards

The latter shipyard will also support all
operations in logistical terms given its
proximity to the bridge site

In addition, the technological skills of the
automation, safety and monitoring systems
of the Group’s various subsidiaries will also
be integrated

The reconstruction of the bridge is destined
to become the symbol of the rebirth of a
great city like Genoa, but also the symbol of
a new phase of the country’s development
It will show that also in Italy, thanks to

a virtuous collaboration between the

public and private spheres, it is possible

to build infrastructures with certain times
and costs, from the stage of identifying

the needs to execution. The hope is that
the Genoa project can represent a model

of collaboration between large Italian
companies that are mutually supportive
of each other, placing a unique industrial

heritage at the disposal of the city and the
country.
