@ FINCANTIERI GROUP

In 2017, the Risk Officer integrated the Risk
Universe with risks concerning sustainability.
The integration process was conducted as
follows:

* mapping of sustainability and climate change
risks by business sector in a context similar to
that of Fincantieri;

¢ initial identification of 16 potential categories
of sustainability risk;

*® comparison with Fincantieri’s company risk
model and with the materiality matrix;

¢ exclusion of certain sustainability risks
because they were not considered applicable
to the company or because they were already
present in Fincantieri’s Risk Universe;

e integration of the risks identified above into
the Risk Universe, in the specific
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
category.

The 10 sustainability risks included in
Fincantieri’s Risk Universe are shown below;
their management is described in the chapters

FINCANTIERI GROUP e

of this Sustainability Report.

The reporting required for the information

to be provided to the company bodies
envisages a specific report on ESG risks for
the Sustainability Committee, with the aim of
facilitating its function of providing guidance to
the Company.
