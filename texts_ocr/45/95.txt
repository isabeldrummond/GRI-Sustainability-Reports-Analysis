METHODOLOGICAL NOTE

The third Sustainability Report of the
Fincantieri Group, approved by the Board of
Directors on 1 April 2020, is a communication
tool that describes, in a transparent and
structured manner, the economic, social

and environmental results achieved, and
demonstrates the Group’s commitment to
sustainable development, with the aim of
creating value not only for the Company, but
also for its stakeholders.

The Report represents the Consolidated
Non-Financial Statement of the Fincantieri
Group prepared in accordance with Articles
3 and 4 of Legislative Decree No. 254/16,
with reference to the 2019 financial year
(from 1 January to 31 December 2019). This
document reports, to the extent necessary
to ensure an understanding of the activities
of the company, its progress, its results and
its impact, in relation to the areas considered
important and required by Article 3 of the
Decree.

As required by Article 5 of the Decree this
document is a distinct report with the
appropriate wording to identify it as the
Consolidated Non-Financial Disclosure (NFD)
required by the regulation.

The contents of the Report have been
prepared in accordance with the Global
Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Sustainability
Reporting Standards of 2016, with the
exception of the GRI 303 - Water and
Effluents and GRI 403 - Occupational Health
and Safety indicators which implement the
GRI 2018 Standard. The Report has been
prepared in accordance with GRI Standards:
Core option.

For further detail on the information required
by the Standards and the indicators reported,
please refer to the table shown in the annex to
this document.

Sustainability reporting is preceded annually
by the analysis and identification of material
topics (materiality matrix page 26), ie.

those which reflect the significant impacts
for the organization from an economic,

social and environmental viewpoint, and
which substantially influence stakeholders’
assessments and decisions, and by the
mapping and risk management methods.

As required by the Decree, for each theme
evidence is given on its materiality in relation
to Group’s activities, the risks connected with
it, the Company's policies and commitments
and the results obtained and monitored using
ad hoc indicators capable of representing the
results in terms of management.

 

With reference to the requirements of Article
3, paragraph 2 of Legislative Decree 254/16,
some information not considered relevant for
an understanding of the company, its progress,
results and impact has been excluded.

Fincantieri defined its Sustainability Plan,
approved by the Board of Directors, which is
aligned to the 2018-2022 Business Plan and
highlights and strengthens the intention to
be a responsible Group. The Plan addresses
some global challenges (such as the UN’s
Sustainability Development Goals) and details
the commitments undertaken by the Group
and breaks them down into qualitative and
quantitative targets that can be measured
over time and subjects them to constant
monitoring.

In 2019, the Fincantieri Group decided to join
the Global Compact, the initiative to promote
and disseminate sustainable development
practices launched and sponsored by the
United Nations, and has therefore committed
itself to integrating the ten principles relating
to human rights, labour rights, environmental
protection and combating corruption into its
policies, strategies and activities.

The Sustainability Report represents the
Communication on Progress (COP) related to
the activity carried out in 2019. In particular,

a table has been prepared (see appendix),
which summarises the actions taken and the
results achieved in relation to each of the
above principles and references the pages of
the Sustainability Report where these topics
are discussed in greater detail.

The process of collecting data and information
and drafting the Report is coordinated

and managed by the Sustainability unit,

in cooperation with the multifunctional
Working Group. The Report’s contents have
been defined according to the principles

of accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability,
reliability and timeliness.

The Sustainability Report has been prepared in
accordance with a specific internal procedure
that defines the roles, responsibilities and
operating methods that Fincantieri S.p.A.’s
and subsidiaries’ staff must follow in order

to guarantee the proper management of all
the data required to prepare the document.

and negative aspects in an equal light and,
where considered appropriate, a comment on

 

the results has been provided. The economic
values are expressed in euros (thousands and/
or millions of euros). Sometimes the data are

number, and therefore their sum may not
coincide exactly with the total value.
