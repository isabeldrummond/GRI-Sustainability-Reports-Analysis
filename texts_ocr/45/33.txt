ECONOMIC VALUE FOR STAKEHOLDERS

The creation of economic value is essential
to ensure that the Group is safeguarded over
time and, therefore, its sustainability. The
distribution of economic value, determined
in accordance with the “direct economic
value generated and distributed” (201-1) of

In 2019, we distributed a total economic value
of €5.8 billion to suppliers, collaborators,

Since 2013, following the acquisition of the
VARD group, our worldwide presence has
increased to around 20 countries, mainly in
Italy, Norway and the United States, which
together produce 98% of revenues. In 2019,
33% of revenues were generated by cruise
ships equipped with green technologies
such as scrubbers that purify exhaust fumes
from hazardous chemicals and pollutants,
selective catalytic reduction systems (SCR)
for ships or liquefied natural gas (LNG)
propulsion.

The data refer to the entire Fincantieri Group.

Fincantieri’s worldwide order book at
December 2019 contains 109 ships and
amounts to €32.7 billion (including those
under a Memorandum of Understanding)
with deliveries stretching to 2027. Demand
drivers continue to be positive in 2019; in
the cruise business, in particular, there is

a demand to replace ships that entered
fleets in the early 1990s, and now made
obsolete by the entry into force of new
safety and environmental regulations

and by the increased profitability of new
generation ships with lower management
costs and a diverse range of entertainment
on board. There was also considerable
activity in the market for naval vessels, with
the finalization of several contracts, mainly
assigned to domestic shipbuilders. The

order backlog offers some guarantee of
visibility that supports the development of
leading-edge supply chains and technology
districts, creating a driving force for the
subcontractor network and fostering Italian
export and innovation.

Our leadership is also based on the ability
to create jobs all over the world, offering
people the opportunity to establish a stable
and long-term relationship with us, and to
share with them the same idea of growth,
improvement and personal fulfilment. In
Italy, in particular, our workforce grew by
672 employees, confirming Fincantieri’s
primary role in the employment context. We
recorded an increase of 2.8% at Group level
compared to 2018.

In order to support our production, we

have created a production network that
requires our shipyards work in synergy and
collaboration with each other so that one
single order brings value to different regions
or nations and not only to the production
site where the ship is delivered. For example,
with regard to the vessels produced by the
VARD group in the five shipyards in Norway,
it is worth noting that these are also partly
built with the operational contribution of
the two shipyards in Romania, the shipyard
in Brazil and the one in Vietnam. With

this integration it possible, on the one

hand, to ensure the proper combination

of functionality, capacity, cost control

and proximity to the market in order to
satisfy the desires of a wide and diversified
international portfolio of customers at the
highest level and, on the other hand, to
generate internationally distributed value by
