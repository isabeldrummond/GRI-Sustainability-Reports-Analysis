of the Privacy Management System (Privacy
Policy) which establishes, among other
things, the main processes needed to ensure
the protections envisaged by the legislation.
With this policy Fincantieri undertakes to
establish and maintain over time a control
model aimed at protecting the personal
data collected and processed as part of

the operational processes of its business,
promoting the development of a pervasive
privacy culture at Group level. With this in
mind, in addition to the dissemination of
privacy statements to the data subjects

and instructions to personnel authorized

to process personal data, Fincantieri has
carried out a pervasive training campaign
that reached the employees of the Parent
Company and was extended to the Italian
subsidiaries.

The Privacy Management System was

laid out in detail in a specific Privacy
Management System Manual and by
operational procedures that identify certain
processes that are especially critical such
as management of data breaches and
management of requests from data subjects
asserting their rights.
