Our energy efficiency measures and the
increased use of energy from renewable
sources (40%) have led to a significant
reduction in indirect emissions from
electricity consumption.

Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions
over hours worked amounted to 0.005
tCO,e with a reduction of 16% compared to
2018.

The Company monitors GHG emissions
with the aim of continuously improving
performance in terms of impact.

The new 50/60 Hz frequency conversion
systems to supply ships became fully
operational at the Sestri Ponente shipyard,
while at the Ancona shipyard an additional
frequency conversion system was added to

We should also mention the conversion

of thermal power stations fuelled with

low sulphur content (BTZ) and diesel fuel
into thermal power stations fuelled with
liquefied natural gas (LNG), also carried out
at the Ancona shipyard, which has led to a
significant reduction in carbon dioxide (CO,)
emissions.

In 2019, we have further expanded the
reporting of other (Scope 3) emissions

that refer to the procurement chain for raw
materials, employee travel, and consumption
of raw materials which are the cause of

the different breakdown and increase

in emissions. For comparison purposes
between the two years, we have also
expanded and revised 2018.

As regards the optimization of material
logistics, in Italy the project to centralize
delivery planning (Control Tower), launched
in 2014, has the goal of managing the
shipyards’ delivery requests in order to
reduce transport costs, improve reliability
and timeliness of deliveries and reduce
environmental impact. In particular, this
project has enabled polluting emissions to
be reduced by

@ planning deliveries using the outgoing and
return formula;

@ increasing vehicle saturation (combing
multiple delivery requests into a single
carrier).

The project led to the reduction of 1,300
journeys in 2019 (corresponding to 383,300
km) and a reduction of 256 t of CO,, equal
to the average CO, absorbed in one year by
around 43 hectares of forest.

FINCANTIERI GROUP @ -----+------++-:

Other emissions of polluting gases

The conversion of all the heating networks
in the Italian shipyards has led to the
elimination of heavy combustibles and the
introduction of methane systems, resulting
in negligible sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions.
VARD and Fincantieri Marine Group have
also significantly reduced (-92%) SOx
emissions, which amounted to 0.74 t in 2018
and 0.06 t in 2019.

The Group’s emissions of nitrogen oxides
(NOx), associated solely with natural gas
combustion, in 2018 amounted to 24.5 tNOx
and in 2019 24.7 tNOx

With a view to continuous improvement, the
VARD group is focused on researching new
approaches to contain and minimize the
impact of emissions resulting from industrial
activities. The group’s commitment is also
demonstrated by its participation, since
2008, in the Confederation of Norwegian
