e-Procurement

Fincantieri Suppliers is Fincantieri’s
e-procurement system dedicated to supplier
management (www.fincantieri-suppliers.com),
providing support throughout all the stages of
procurement activities.

In line with the objective of strengthening
communication with our suppliers, the portal is
developed to manage the following processes:

¢ marketing, offering the possibility to each
supplier to participate in the selection process
regarding Italy by registering on the portal;

Management of contracting companies

The production process we have adopted is
structured to operate as an integrated model
that makes use of skills, technologies and
production capacities both inside and outside
the Company.

The widespread participation of the
resources involved in company business
processes and the sharing of common
principles, behaviours and objectives are
fundamental for achieving continuous
improvement objectives. We have therefore
pressed on, in continuity with the guidelines
adopted in recent years, with significantly
reducing the supply chain in some specific
activities (insulation, painting) and at the
same time we have intensified actions
aimed at consolidating the relationship with
suppliers considered strategic, in particular
for supply activities and turnkey contracts,
through medium/long-term contractual
agreements.

* requests for offers, made available to selected
suppliers in digital format, to which they
can respond by sending their economic and
technical offers on the same platform;

* purchase contracts, digitally signed and made
available electronically to suppliers, who
in turn can accept them directly on the
system without printing and sending paper
documents to Fincantieri.

Using the e-procurement system saves a lot of
time, transport costs (and related emissions of
CO,), printing and use of paper throughout the
procurement process.

The prospect of stabilizing the supplier
base by pursuing long-term partnerships
with the consequent continuity in terms of
worker presence in the individual production
sites is able to provide the best response

to the expectations formulated by some
institutional stakeholders in areas involved.
The continuity of companies and the
reduction of worker turnover can in fact
allow local authorities to improve the
planning of infrastructure and social
services, as well as result in a more effective
management of integration policies.

We have signed further framework
agreements with leading employment
agencies in order to make it easier for
satellite businesses to find qualified
resources, also through specific training
courses aimed at the most sought-after
professional profiles.

The entire supply process is subject to
controls and constraints that commit

suppliers to meeting all their legal
obligations, in particular with regard to

the rights of employees, starting from the
qualification phase - and their inclusion in
the Register of Suppliers - and the awarding
of orders. Further controls are envisaged
when entering the production sites and
during the entire time they remain at the
operating units.

These guidelines and trends were shared at
the trade union level and implemented in the
