OUR EVER GREENER SHIPS

The world of navigation, whether cruise,
merchant or naval, is going through a
process of evolution under the principles

of sustainability and the circular economy.
For Fincantieri, this scenario is already a
consolidated reality and with our projects
we are literally redesigning the future
scenario of navigation, at a strategic

and technological level. The ships under
construction will be increasingly resemble

a large, hyper-connected, energy self-
sufficient, lighter and green or hybrid
propellant floating city, capable of recycling
up to 90% of the waste produced.

With the technologies already applied today
we are able to cut 1,200 tons of fuel per year
ona ship of about 130 thousand GRT (gross
registered tonnage).

Cruise ships

The cruise ship industry is highly
committed to adopting policies to minimize
environmental impact, this is a joint

effort implemented by cruise lines and
shipbuilders.

The regulatory framework, with regulations
at a global and local level, requires a rapid

reduction of emissions into the air and water.

The reduction of environmental impact has
become one of the most important drivers
or design and innovation in the field of
cruise ships.

Our ships represent a technological
benchmark at the European and global
evel. They feature the most advanced
echnologies, with technical solutions that
provide energy savings, emission reduction,
high performance and high quality.

n particular, we follow all the international
best practices to minimize a ship’s
environmental impact throughout its entire
ife cycle.
