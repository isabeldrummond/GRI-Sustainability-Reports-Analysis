Fincantieri in the media

An important role in spreading the
sustainability culture is played by the
Marketing Communication and Media
Relations department in conveying all the
messages, which originate from direct
dialogue with management both inside and
outside the Group.

In 2019, the initiatives promoted, in particular
by the Media Relations office, have produced
numerous articles that mention Fincantieri,
divided as follows:

In 2019, we involved our employees,
customers, suppliers and partners, the
financial community and other stakeholders
in helping us understand where we can and
should make the most impact, in an initial
path of engagement that we are committed
to developing over time. We have identified,
together with them, the material issues
considered relevant for both the Company
and its stakeholders.

Which material topics have been identified
by our stakeholders?

We launched and have since consolidated
over time a process called materiality
analysis, aimed at identifying material topics
for sustainability, namely those topics that

are relevant from an economic, social and
environmental point of view for Fincantieri
and its stakeholders. We use the results of the
analysis to define the Group’s commitments,
the objectives of the Sustainability Plan and
the reporting of the Sustainability Report.

To define the most significant topics we
analysed both the perception of the topics
from the Company's perspective, through

a questionnaire, and from the perspective

of customers, suppliers and partners, the
financial community and other stakeholders
through a special online survey, asking them to
evaluate the material topics identified by the
Company.

Both internally and externally the topics were
evaluated on a scale of 1-4, where 4 is "highly
significant”. A materiality threshold was
defined (corresponding to 2), beyond which
an issue must be accounted for.

Joint consideration of internal and external
significance led to the identification of the
material topics. The materiality matrix has

stakeholders contacted and a new material
topic deemed relevant by both the Company
and the stakeholders has been added: cyber

articles online.
