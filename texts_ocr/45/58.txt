We are aware that the complexity of our
business requires high standards in terms
of quality, cost and time of products and
services offered. This is why we have
adopted a Quality Policy able to convey the
commitment of the Group’s resources on
specific key points. The goal is to achieve
and maintain an excellent level of quality in
strategic choices, business processes and
every activity.

Every company or division adopts a Quality
Management System (QMS), certified
according to the ISO 9001 standard, which
ensures compliance with the best standards.
100% of Italian production sites are certified
ISO 9001 and 96% at Group level

Quality assurance at each stage of the
process, from the acquisition of the contract
to the design and procurement, down to the
production or provision of the services, is

entrusted to each process owner.
