@ FINCANTIERI GROUP

We regularly monitor quality indicators, at a
divisional level (for homogeneous business
areas) and at production level:

¢ shipbuilding sectors (cruise ships, naval
vessels, mega yachts), are classified by job
and by construction, which allows detailed
comparisons to be made with regard to
homogeneous “objects” and “phases”;

¢ inthe plant and components sector (e.g.
diesel engines, turbines, naval systems and
systems, cabins for passenger ships), the
classification is by production process,
facilitated by repetitions in small and
medium-sized series.

The VARD subsidiary also uses the Quality
Plan for its projects. The quality indicators
and the achievement of the related annual
objectives constitute a fundamental part
of the incentive programmes of the entire
Fincantieri organization.

Regarding the management of military
orders, during 2019 four audits were carried
out by the Italian Government Quality
Assurance (AQG), which involved the FREMM
Programme, the Multi-Purpose Patrol Vessel
(PPA), Logistic Support Ship (LSS) and
Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) jobs, with 16
non-conformities, of which 11 have already
been resolved and 5 are being resolved.

Customer satisfaction

The main sector in which we operate is
intrinsically characterized by a limited number
of competitors and customers. The measure
of customer satisfaction and retention cannot
therefore be based on significant data and
statistical samples. It requires instead a long-
term analysis of the relationship between
market trends, assignment of orders and

jobs to the various players, the time taken

to transform negotiations into orders, the
maintenance of historic customers, and the

acquisition and retention of new customers.

We regularly survey the market and the
competition, from which certain “loyalty”
factors can be deduced.

In Italy, five new ships were delivered in
2019, four cruise ships and one naval vessel.
Delivery of the 8th frigate in the FREMM
programme was accompanied by a letter of
congratulations from the customer OCCAR
(Organisation for Joint Armament Co-
operation).

As part of the Sustainability Plan, there is

a specific objective regarding customer
satisfaction which includes the development
of the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI)
system. For its regulation, in 2019, the
internal procedure was defined and tested
on two orders, one from the Cruise Ship
Division and one from the Naval Shipping
Division. The resulting CSI of 85/100 is a very
satisfactory starting value.

Fincantieri Marine Group surveys customer
satisfaction three times a year through

FINCANTIERI GROUP e

meetings with representatives of Lockheed
Martin and the US Navy. These sessions
cover the following areas: technical, testing,
planning, quality, after sales and Integrated
Logistics Support (ILS). During these
monitoring sessions, the company receives
feedback on the degree of customer
satisfaction and on any problems. The
corrective actions are defined at that time,
with subsequent follow-up.

In VARD, customers’ requirements and
expectations are defined during contract
negotiations and are maintained and
developed throughout all the project
stages. Customer satisfaction is monitored
periodically and continuously, both during
the production stage and during the
guarantee and after-sales period. Each
product is subject to voluntary feedback
by customers. Customers also provide

the company with voluntary testimonials.
Unsurprisingly, the company’s slogan is “Built
on Trust”.
