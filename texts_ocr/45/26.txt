means to combat corruption. The first of
these documents is the Anti-corruption
Policy adopted by the Company in 2014 and
updated in January 2019, which introduces a
regulatory system to protect sensitive areas.

As part of the process of constant evolution
and continuous improvement of the
Company’s anti-corruption system, we
launched a project in 2019 with the aim of
obtaining certification by the end of 2020 for
its anti-corruption management systems, one
objective included in the Sustainability Plan.
The project, which avails itself of advisory
support, envisages the Internal Auditing
Function coordinating a working group made
up of the company functions/departments
most directly involved in sensitive processes,
in order to prepare and/or integrate the
Company’s procedural and organizational
controls to adapt them to the standards
required by certification. At an organizational
level, in order to oversee the Company’s anti-
corruption system, in accordance with the
ISO 37001 standard, it is the responsibility of
the Board of Directors to identify and appoint
the “anti-corruption compliance function”,
giving it the appropriate operational
responsibilities and authority to carry out its
duties. To this end, the Board of Directors
established the Anti-Corruption function at
the meeting held on 28 January 2020.

With reference to the Parent Company,
the Internal Auditing function examines
and independently evaluates the internal
controls to verify if what is required by the

anti-corruption procedures has been met
within the range of the annual planned audits,
approved by the Board of Directors. The
Supervisory Body plays a special role. Its
activities call for the periodic collection of
confidential information in order to identify
potentially risky conduct with reference to
corruption both with respect to Italian and
foreign Public Administrations, and to private
parties. The Organizational, Management

and Control Model according to Legislative
Decree No. 231/200] and the corporate
regulatory framework are subject to a
continuous updating process to comply with
organizational and legal changes and to
adequately respond to the possible risk of
committing crimes.

 

Among the tools for preventing the risk of
corruption, the Company has - since 2009 -
adopted a system for reporting infringements
to the Supervisory Body (whistleblowing),
also defined in the Organizational Model,
which enables employees and third parties
to report issues involving non-compliance
with the provisions of the Code of Conduct,
the Organizational Model, or of the
corporate procedures or, otherwise, the

law. Since January 2019, an update of the
whistleblowing computer system has been
made operational. This system uses an
independent platform to send reports and is
an evolution in terms its suitability in order
to ensure the confidentiality of the sources
and of the information communicated (as
required by Law No. 179 of 30 November
2017).

Communication and training on the anti-
corruption procedures and policies

With regard to Legislative Decree No.
231/01, and in particular relating to anti-
corruption and safety at work, an e-learning
training project has been in place since 2016,
supported by the Supervisory Body and the
Internal Auditing function.

The training system for this course is divided
into differentiated paths in order to allow
targeted distribution of the information
based on the roles of the people involved.
The “general” path has been delivered

to all employees of the Parent Company
(equipped with company PC and email),
while agents and specific corporate
departments were also given specific
modules.

During 2019, the program continued with
the provision of an on-line course for
agents focusing on anti-corruption and
company risks, and new editions of the
general course and on safety at work and
the environment were started for those

who had not participated in the previous
editions. For employees of Italian subsidiaries,
specific anti-corruption training meetings are
held, organized by their supervisory bodies
with a view to extending this training to the
e-learning mode.

The Board of Directors receives an annual
report from the Supervisory Body on the
activities performed, including training.
Regarding foreign subsidiaries, the VARD
group and Fincantieri Marine Systems North
America Inc. (FMSNA) have held training on
the Code of Conduct and business ethics,
while in 2019 Fincantieri Marine Group (FMG)
did not carry out any training on the issues in
question since the contents of the course have
been revised and it will be resumed in 2020.
The courses were held in the local language of
the countries where the companies involved in
training are based (Italy, USA, Norway, Croatia,
Poland, Romania and Vietnam).

The table below shows the data on the overall
number of employees who received training in
2018 and 2019.
