Our business model

We are able to produce different types

of units at the same time, and we have

the flexibility to cope with any changes
occurring during construction. Our products
feature a high level of personalization and,
in many cases, are prototypes with cutting-
edge technological solutions. As such, they
require significant efforts in terms of design,
procurement, production, planning and
order management. We act as a systems
integrator, usually acting as the prime/
general contractor, managing the project
for vessel construction as a whole and
taking on responsibility for this.

Typically, while there are differences

BUSINESS MODEL: SUMMARY DIAGRAM

due to the strategic business area and
product type, for each order we develop
directly project management, design,

hull procurement and manufacture, while
our role mainly involves integration and
coordination of a qualified network of
expert suppliers for the preparation of
systems, accommodation and, for naval
vessels, weapons systems. In terms of
business model we have adopted a make or
buy strategy for each step of development
and construction of the vessel order, with
the objective of keeping core skills and high
value-added activities within the Group and
outsourcing to qualified suppliers specialist
activities that are low value-added or non-
essential.

OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY

For us, a company is sustainable when it
generates value with the future and not just
the present in mind, namely when it also
generates value for those who come after
us. To do this, we work so that every person
in the Group understands the value of being
sustainable and reflects in their everyday
work the fundamental principles of social
responsibility, undertaking and contributing
to satisfying the stakeholder expectations
today and tomorrow, creating a virtuous
cycle that generates synergy and shared,
proactive commitment. Sustainability is not
just an opportunity but a duty and a real
mission to represent a model of excellence
in the world. Being sustainable means
constantly improving health and safety in
the workplace, developing technological
innovation, promoting a responsible supply
chain, maintaining customer satisfaction
and trust, engaging with local communities
by supporting them and, last but not least,
reducing environmental impact by helping
to combat climate change. This is all with
the aim of finding a tomorrow that is better
than today.

As a sign of our commitment and the
importance of increasing integration of
sustainability in our strategic choices, in
2019 we joined the United Nations Global
Compact, the most wide-ranging business
sustainability initiative in the world. This is
a voluntary initiative to adopt ten universal
principles related to human rights, labour,
the environment and the fight against
corruption, which promote the values of
sustainability in the long term through
political actions, business practices and
social and civil behaviour.

We are also committed to contributing to
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development, approved by

the General Assembly in 2015. These are
common sustainable development goals for
today’s complex social challenges. These
goals are an important reference for the
international community and for Fincantieri
in conducting its business.
