VARD group: supply chain

Approximately 60% of the VARD group’s
value of orders issued concern Norwegian
suppliers and 32% are located in other
European countries. The remaining 8% is
distributed between South America and
Asia.

The selection criteria used are based on the
maker list, but also on the supply history and
previous purchasing experiences.

Turnkey contracts are the most commonly
used type of purchase orders, followed by
materials and equipment. Together they
represent 72% of the total orders issued by
the group.

Purchasing management is entrusted to the
Alesund headquarters, while purchase plans

are managed by the procurement teams of
the various sites.

Goods and services are purchased from
suppliers who can guarantee specific
quality levels. Suppliers must be selected
from those that have been registered as
approved suppliers (maker list) through a
direct evaluation by VARD or an evaluation
by other companies within the VARD
group. During the supplier selection
process, preferential requirements include

possession of certification concerning health,

safety, anti-corruption and the environment.

For activities relating to the cruise sector, a
new market segment for VARD, the central
purchasing management team also uses

qualified suppliers approved by the Parent

 

Company. Suppliers who work for VARD
first receive safety courses, available in

5 different languages. The acquisition of
goods and services is based on technical
and commercial information. Requests for
proposals are sent to the possible suppliers,
and after the technical and commercial
approval, a winning supplier is selected. A
contract/agreement is then signed anda
purchase order is issued.

Purchase orders are issued on two
complementary systems, through which the
entire procurement process is managed:
production specifications, order approval
processes, delivery times and payment
conditions.

Audit activities are carried out periodically
through the yard health, safety, environment
and quality (HSEQ) managers accompanied
by the central purchasing function to

check compliance with the contractual
requirements agreed for the jobs. In 2019,
75 audits were carried out on suppliers, 43
of which based on environmental and social
criteria, none received a negative evaluation.
In particular, VARD Vung Tau, which holds
SA 8000 certification, also carried out 17
audits of its suppliers in 2019 based on
checklists covering environmental and social
issues; these did not reveal any critical
situations

The data on the value of orders issued are
given below.
