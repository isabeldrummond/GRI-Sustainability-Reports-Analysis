mission, projects that have positive effects of
public interest.

Our economic contribution in the various
countries where we are present is also
expressed at tax level and is divided into
various types of taxes, which can be
grouped into the following categories:

* income tax, corporation tax;

* property taxes, charges on ownership, sale
or lease of property;

* taxes on labour, including taxes collected
and paid to the tax authorities on behalf of
employees;

e indirect taxes levied on the production and
consumption of goods and services, such
as VAT, customs duties, etc.

In the spirit of the Code of Conduct, we

are committed to acting with honesty and
integrity in all tax matters and aim to pursue
a transparent and sustainable long-term tax
strategy. We are committed to complying
with legislation in all jurisdictions in which we
operate, working closely with tax authorities,
tax advisors and auditors to ensure payment
of the taxes due.

Our massive presence in the territories
where we operate certainly generates
benefits, but it can also cause inconvenience
to the local population. For this reason we
are committed to respecting the rights

of communities and contributing to their
economic and social progress, interacting
with a variety of stakeholders on a daily
basis. The search for shared value for the
Company and its stakeholders represents
an opportunity to combine competitiveness

with the creation of social value in the long
erm. Such a vast geographical perimeter
necessarily implies confronting different
enterprises and an in-depth knowledge of
he territory and the needs of the various
stakeholders in order to identify targeted
solutions.

For this reason we try to reduce our impacts
hrough responsible management, helping
he institutions in the territories where we
are present.

umerous initiatives have been implemented
in the Monfalcone area, where one of

our most significant shipyards is located.
Fincantieri and the Municipality of
Monfalcone, sharing the need to increase
ocal school facilities, also caused by the
impact of the population active in the
shipyard, have conducted a feasibility study
or the renovation of a building, owned by

 

he Municipality, to be used as a nursery
school. The project envisages the creation
of a number of classrooms equipped with

all the necessary services, potentially able to
accommodate about one hundred children.
After the Agreement is signed, scheduled
for spring 2020, Fincantieri will return the
property to the Municipality of Monfalcone,
renovated and adapted for the new use, in
time for the start of the 2020/21 school year.
Fincantieri has also undertaken to bear the
operating costs with a contribution for the
first three years of activity.

We are also strongly committed to reducing
the environmental impacts, generated by our
activities, on the community. As part of the
noise reduction plan adopted by Fincantieri

and in line with the provisions contained in
the Integrated Environmental Authorization,
the Company has undertaken, in addition to
an extensive investment programme at the
Monfalcone site, to replace the windows and
doors in some of the houses most exposed
to the noise generated by the shipyard’s
production processes. This work will take
place during 2020 under the coordination of
the Municipality of Monfalcone.

In addition, the company is transforming the
area of the former railway into a cycle path
and has arranged free buses to reach the
shipyard from the external parking areas.
Also at the Monfalcone site, a project has
been developed to provide healthcare
directly on site to non-resident staff in

order to reduce the impact on the hospital's
emergency services operating units,
improving the quality of the service offered
o each worker concerned and at the same
ime ensuring prevention and diagnostics.

Fincantieri signed a joint working agreement
or charitable purposes with the Banco
Alimentare (Food Bank) of the Liguria and
arche Regions and with the companies that
provide catering services at the canteens in
he Muggiano and Ancona shipyards. Under
hese initiatives, which replicate similar
experiences already underway at the Sestri
Ponente and Riva Trigoso shipyards, the
Company donates the food not eaten at the
shipyard canteens in order to redistribute it
o charities that support and help the poor
and, more generally, people in need. Further
agreements with the Food Bank or other
associations will be concluded during 2020,
where locally compatible.
