OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK
MANAGEMENT

The System of Internal Control and Risk
Management System (ICRMS) of the Company
is formed by a set of tools, organizational
structures, and company procedures aimed at
contributing business conduct which is honest,
fair and consistent with the objectives set by
the Board of Directors

The ICRMS is integrated within the general
organizational aspects and corporate
governance system adopted by the

Company and, taking into account the main
reference models, allows and promotes the
identification, measurement, management,
and monitoring of the main risks as well as

the dependability, accuracy, reliability and
timeliness of the financial report. This system,
based on leading international practices, is
divided into the three traditional levels of
control:

¢ Ist level: the operational functions identify
and evaluate the risks and implement
specific treatments for their management;

e 2nd level: the functions responsible for risk
control define the methods and tools for
risk management and perform monitoring
activities;

e 3rd level: the Internal Auditing function
provides independent evaluations regarding
the entire system.

The guidelines, approved by the Board of
Directors, identify the main parties involved

in the preparation and implementation of an
effective internal control and risk management
system, involving each of them based on their
area of expertise.

It is also required that all employees of

the Group, as part of their functions and
responsibilities, actively intervene according to

the methods defined in the Group’s regulatory
system and internal procedures for the
maintenance, updating, and correct operation
of the ICRMS

Following is a representative diagram of the
parties involved in Risk Management at various
