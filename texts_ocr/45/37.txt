capacity to provide highly technological and
customized solutions and is evident whenever
the need to apply solid know-how in system
integration emerges.

We have repeatedly confirmed our position

as one of the most competitive global players,
thanks to our flexibility and ability to adapt

to significant and cyclical changes in market
needs. These fluctuations require a continuous
process of change that generates product
innovations, applicable to all types of ships,
and process innovations, which are necessary
in order to apply new technologies and
recover productivity.

We aim to be proactive towards shipowners
by always offering innovative solutions that
anticipate future technological evolutions.
The constant updating of products and
processes is one of the fundamental values
of Fincantieri that have led to it being one of
the most competitive players in its business
globally. In this sense, the capacity to seize
on the promising synergies in terms of
innovation at international level characterizes
the Group’s actions and makes it gradually
more integrated with and sensitive to market
dynamics.

WE ARE INNOVATORS

The main objective we have set ourselves in
order to direct our work strategically in the
near future is the definition, shared with our
European partners, of a vision of innovation
rajectories in the shipbuilding industry.
This is confirmed by our commitment in the
recent definition of the Strategic Research
Agenda (SRA) of WATERBORNE, the
European Research and Innovation Platform
or Waterborne Industries. The work was
carried out in collaboration with the main
associations in the industry to outline the
prospects for collective development in the
coming years. In particular, WATERBORNE’s
SRA proposes to radically transform
waterborne transport by giving new impetus
o European leadership in high value-
added ships. This will be feasible thanks

o the definition of new business models
aimed at supporting sustainable growth in
he shipping industry and the integration

of goods and passenger transport into a
seamless solution for shipping, ports and
related logistics.

 

In this context, innovation is a key element
for the European shipbuilding industry to
continue to maintain a global leadership
position, demonstrating that it is fully able
to handle the greatest technological and

environmental challenges of our time. implementing our strategic vision by
