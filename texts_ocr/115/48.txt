WHISTLEBLOWING

All Saipem employees and stakeholders must report any violations (or alleged violations) of the OM&C Model. Saipem has a
Corporate standard that describes the process of managing reports. The term ‘report’ refers to any information regarding
possible violations, behaviours and practices not in line with the Code of Ethics and/or which may cause damage or injury to

Saipem SpA (even if only to its image) or any of its subsidiaries.

Whistleblowers are guaranteed protection from any form, direct or indirect, of retaliation, discrimination or penalisation, for
reasons connected directly or indirectly to the report, without prejudice to the legal obligations and the protection of the
rights of the Company or of the people accused owing to wilful misconduct or gross negligence.

Saipem has prepared various channels of communication in order to facilitate sending reports, including, but not necessarily limited
to, regular post, fax numbers, e-mail, yellow box and communication tools on the Intranet/Internet sites of Saipem SpA andits
subsidiaries. The Internal Audit function ensures that appropriate controls are carried out for facts that have been reported.

In the framework of the Saipem Innovation Trophy, the
initiative received a special award for the innovative
communication method, which enables improved
internalisation of the culture of Ethics and Business Integrity,

BUSINESS ETHICS TRAINING PROGRAMMES

Saipem personnel are regularly informed of and trained in
the Company's Compliance and Governance systems, as
well as in the importance of compliance with legislation
and related procedures, so that they clearly understand
the different duties, crimes, risks, the relevant personal
and corporate responsibilities, and how to recognise which
actions to implement in order to avoid committing any
violations.

Given the criticality of these issues, a training matrix on
Compliance and Governance topics was defined and is
constantly updated. In particular, it takes legal requirements
and Company standards into consideration, as well as the
jobs and responsibilities of the resources to whom the
training is addressed.

With the goal of consolidating everyone's knowledge and
awareness of Compliance and Governance and providing
greater clarity and consistency as regards the numerous
training initiatives launched over the last few years, the
matrix is a comprehensive tool for planning, executing

and monitoring Compliance and Governance training.
Participation in mandatory training programmes is a
contractual obligation for Saipem personnel.

The training matrix on Compliance and Governance topics
is not astatic tool. Rather, even after it being issued, its
updating and development will continue with the design
phase (where necessary) and the delivery of training
initiatives to offer a vast, uniform and systematic training

 

catalogue (including both classroom and e-learning courses).

 

Within the framework of the matrix, Anti-Corruption themes

play a central role by offering:

* specific training sessions for at-risk personnel (employees
who have contact with public officials or who may enter

into contracts with third parties on Saipem’s behalf)
working in the countries where Saipem operates;

* two e-learning modules respectively on the OM&C Model
and on the Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme;

* an e-learning module for blue collar and white collar
workers who do not have at-risk positions on Code of
Ethics, OM&C Model 231 and Anti-Corruption Programme;

* aspecific e-learning module on the ‘Internal Control
System over Corporate Reporting’ delivered to Saipem
personnel in Italy and abroad.

In the framework of the OM&C Model, Code of Ethics and

Anti-Corruption training, Saipem organised numerous

training sessions in 2018.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The integration of an advanced Corporate Governance
system with a structured risk management system is

a cornerstone for the management of a sustainable
business. Integrity and transparency are the principles
that inspire Saipem in defining its Corporate Governance
system, a founding element of the Company's

business model. Saipem’s organisational structure is
characterised by the presence of a Board of Directors
(BoD), a pivotal body in the governance system, to which
management of the Company is exclusively entrusted.
The Board of Statutory Auditors has supervisory
functions, whereas external auditors are in charge of the
legal auditing of accounts. 3 committees with advisory
and consulting functions have been set up within the
BoD: the Audit and Risk Committee, the Compensation
and Nomination Committee and the Governance
Committee and Scenarios.
