MARIO MARCHIONNA, Corporate Head of Technology Innovation

Mario, could you name two examples of innovations in your products over the last year that were the most beneficial

to the future of our business?

As a first example, we are developing a new platform of subsea remote controlled, resident and Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUV) called ‘Hydrone’, allowing Saipem to enter the /ife of field business. Saipem and Shell
recently signed an agreement for the industrial production and commercialisation of the ‘FlatFish’, an AUV dedicated
to the inspection of subsea structures and pipelines. The Hydrone platform

will then take advantage of some of the technologies already developed on

the FlatFish prototype, in particular for the ‘'Hydrone-S' vehicle, the ‘resident

AUV' member of the family. The use of resident drones for subsea field

inspection, monitoring and maintenance takes on even greater importance.

Asecond example, a new digital collaborative and data-centric
methodology for the whole project life-cycle management (xD Information
Model, 'xDIM™") has been conceived. The development of the platform is

underwa

d an initial pilot project was completed; once totally developed,

xDIM™ will revolutionise the way Saipem will realise its projects.

AN ATTITUDE FOR INNOVATING TOGETHER

Our own resources are decisive but not sufficient as
innovating requires collaboration within and outside the
Oil&Gas industry to be receptive to crossover technologies
from aerospace and defence, automotive, IT, telecom and
biomedical, etc

Within this general framework, Saipem has always displayed

a collaborative attitude, leveraging a broad network of
technology suppliers, universities, research centres, university
spin-offs, start-ups, commercial partners, as shown by the
number of collaborations and Joint Industry Projects (JIPs),
activated in recent years. Among them, most notably is the
5-year collaboration agreement signed with the ‘Politecnico di
Milano’ that includes the creation of a Joint Research Centre.

An example comes from the subsea Oil&Gas market. Subsea

processing, in fact, will contribute to reducing costs by moving

most of surface operations and equipment to the seabed

Significant results have been achieved in terms of a full-scale

subsea factory, heading to the Subsea-to-Shore solution

« Inthe short term, we are carrying out the industrialisation
of the SPRINGS™ (Subsea PRocess and INjection Gear for
Seawater) subsea water treatment technology as a result
of the collaboration with industrial partners such as Total,
Veolia and also Siemens for Subsea Control Systems

* Inthe long term, we are developing, together with major oil
companies, the proprietary Spoolsep technology for the
gravity separation of produced water from oil; furthermore,
we are collaborating with Petrobras on its Dense Phase
CO, Separation Hi-Sep™ technology.

All these innovations lead us to extend our collaboration
perimeter and change our traditional attitude by changing
the business model and involving several partners to unlock
the supply chain

DIVERSIFY TO INNOVATE

Regarding diversification outside the Oil&Gas market, the
main efforts are devoted to the following

low-carbon markets (i.e. offshore wind farms, biofuels,
concentrated solar power, geothermal). In 2017, we
successfully installed the first floating Wind Farm in
the world, the Hywind Scotland Project that required
an innovative solution to lift, handle and install the wind
turbine generators on floating spars anchored to the
seabed. Several new solutions in the Offshore Floating
Wind segment are currently under development

* Creating access to new renewable and low-carbon
markets. We also invest in emerging technologies such
as advanced wind farms, emerging marine technologies,
energy storage and the potential use of hydrogenasa
clean energy carrier produced by water with renewable
energy.

¢ Reinforce our presence in non-energy related markets
such as infrastructures for sustainable mobility, water
pipelines, and environmental services

MOSS 60 ECO - MW,
FIRST SEMI-SUBMERSIBLE DRILLING RIG
WITH HYBRID POWER SYSTEM

Moss Maritime, a subsidiary of Saipem, has secured a
contract to build the CS60 ECO - MW, the first new build
semi-submersible drilling rig with Hybrid power system

With the CS60 ECO design we see the start of anew era with
regard to drilling rig
design and operation
Since the last wave

of new build orders
for drilling rigs, new
technologies have
matured combining
traditional diesel-
