OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

The UN Global Compact is also a call to contribute to achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), societal goals
at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted in 2015 and aimed at ending extreme poverty, fighting
inequality and injustice, and protecting the planet by 2030.

In working towards these goals, we not only have focused on the ones that relate directly to our business, but also on the
ones connected to our ability to create value in the areas where we operate. Specific local initiatives have been carried out in
areas such as socio-economic development, education and professional training, environment and health promotion.

In Bolivia, near the area where a Saipem rig is located, a public health conference was organised to
promote awareness on the importance of the application of preventive practices of healthy lifestyles
and hygiene, in support of the Bolivian government significant efforts to increase access to safe water
and sanitation, as well as to improve hygiene practices. The key point was the prevention of diseases
that have a higher prevalence in children under 5 years of age. This activity consisted of teaching and
reinforcing the basic principles of personal hygiene, washing hands, oral hygiene, the use of home
remedies to prevent seasonal diseases.

Petromar (Saipem’s subsidiary in Angola) with the
participation of the Vandumbu project. It can hold up

Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme
(SIWES) is a training programme initiated by the
Federal Government of Nigeria, designed to
expose and prepare students of tertiary institutions
(Universities, Polytechnics & Colleges of Education)
for real work situations they are likely to encounter
after graduation. In this training, students are
exposed to work methods and techniques of
handling various tasks in operations and undergo
relevant HSE training to assist them in working
safely. With this approach, we help to bridge the

gap between theory and practice and make the
transition upon graduation to work relatively easier.
The training (between 4 to 12 months) focuses on
fields such as Coating & Painting, Quality Assurance
& Control, Project Control, Assets Management, etc.
