‘one-off’ initiative. Promoting diversity and inclusion in the
workplace is a constant work in progress to be maintained

become amember of ‘Valore D' in July 2018.

Valore D empowers companies to turn diversity and inclusion
into a major asset, promoting new models for an inclusive
organisation in order to support participation, collaboration
and fruitful dialogue between different genders, ages and
cultures within the company. Top Management has also
promoted a cultural awareness workshop of ‘Unconscious
