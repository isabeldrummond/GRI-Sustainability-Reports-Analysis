SAFETY FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

Spills are among the most critical environmental aspects

in our activities. We are strongly committed to improve

‘prevention’ and ‘preparedness’. Prevention is by far the

most important area to take into account. Starting from

the identification of the main situations in which a spill of

pollutants may occur, this specific activity defines the entire

picture in order to avoid any release, from the smallest to the
biggest event. In line with this belief, we started performing

Spill Risk Assessments (SRA) for all our vessels, yards

and rigs. Through a rigorous and consistent method, the

assessments assigned arisk level for all equipment onboard

in order to evaluate wherever the risk is unacceptable and

to provide a priority order for the implementation of risk

reduction measures.

The process consists of 3 different steps:

1) Mapping all the equipment capable of generating spills of
oil or of other substances hazardous to the environment.

2) Assessing the risk through a qualitative evaluation
of probability of release, and magnitude of the
consequences for the environment.

3) Implementing prevention and mitigation measures (i.e.
location of the item, quantity, pressure and eco-toxic
information of the oil or chemical contained, number of
spill barriers, leakage in the past of similar items, expected
spill response time).

For every item a list of information was collected: name of
the item, location, quantity of the oil or chemical, name and
type of the substance, pressure of the substance, subject to
weather, subject to damage from impact, number of barriers,
leakage in the past, equipment present in the maintenance
register, expected spill response time.

Taking into account all the information, a spill risk
assessment is performed. The output identifies any
criticalities in one or more items on-board every vessel.

The spill risk assessment will be used to better evaluate the
quantity and the location of the spill response equipment.
Between 2017 and 2018, Saipem completed the mapping

for the entire offshore construction fleet and the offshore
fabrication yards, except Malembo. Furthermore it performed
10 Oil spill risk assessments (6 in 2018) to start the
implementation of risk reduction measures where applicable.

Spill risk assessments on vessels (Saipem 7000, FDS,
FDS 2, Castoro 2, Castorone), rigs (Saipem 12000, TAD,
Scarabeo 9) and yards (Arbatax, Ambriz) performed
between 2017 and 2018

 

In addition to the risk assessment, the Oil & Chemical
Mapping also provides an actual map of the onsite presence
of oils and chemicals. The mapping process is carried out
both on our fleet and at offshore yards. In this way, the items
identified are represented on a graphic layout of the site
with a practical overview of the spill risk areas, where special
attention is needed.

Competence and preparedness play a crucial role in case
an unexpected event occurs. For this reason, each onshore
project is required to prepare an annual drill plan, containing
at least one drill every three months, covering different spill
scenarios (refuelling, chemical storage, use of hazardous
materials, etc.).

To ensure that personnel involved in spill management is
properly trained, each project is requested to deliver spill
prevention and response training to people involved in
activities at risk of spill.
