@ Business Opportunity

Financial impact calculations consider
the market outlook and current tendering
activities and an estimation of future
Saipem revenues in these segments

Market opportunities in terms of value
of railway projects for ongoing tenders
or projects to be awarded within next
3 years may are significant. The CCS
market will be strongly influenced

by worldwide carbon tax evolution,
technology development and utilisation
of CO, as raw material (e.g. methanol
and urea). CO,-rich Gas field market

is estimated to be around €55 billion.
Saipem's financial impact is estimated
to be a share of this market

THE ROLE OF THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES
The Board has been increasingly involved in the internal strategic discussion on climate-related issues and their
implications on business strategy and related plans.
An annual workshop is organised for Board members and Division Managers to discuss the strategic outlook.

During the workshop organised in September 2018, the Board discussed the implications of recent international and
geo-political events on energy markets. The Sustainability, Scenarios and Corporate Governance Committee
(previously called the Corporate Governance Committee and Scenarios) has the task of assisting the Board of
Directors by fulfilling a preparatory, consultative and advisory role in assessments and decision-making processes

with regard to the Sustainability, Corporate Governance and the review of scenarios considered in the preparation of
the Strategic Plan. The committee, chaired by the Chairman of the Board, addressed the topic of climate change on
several occasions in meetings held in 2017. The Audit and Risk Committee has been entrusted with the duty to consult
and support the Board of Directors’ decisions in matters relating to the internal control and risk management system.
The results of Enterprise Risk Assessment, which may include climate-related risks, are submitted for review and advice
to the Committee every six months. The Managerial Performance Plan, drawn up on the basis of the Strategic Plan,

is approved by the Board of Directors of Saipem on the proposal of the Compensation and Nomination Committee,
assigning the objectives set out therein to the CEO of Saipem. Subsequently, the CEO communicates the objectives set
out, so that they are shared and implemented throughout the relevant organisational structure.

In 2018, the Board of Directors approved the Company's objectives, including those related to climate change, withina
comprehensive sustainability MBO with a weight of 15% of the variable executive compensation. The achievement of
these objectives is then monitored on a half-year basis.
