INNOVATION AS STRATEGIC COMPANY LEVERAGE

Innovation is one of the main pillars of Saipem’s strategic plan,
as it is an advantage for strengthening and consolidating
the company’s competitive positioning for tackling future
challenges. Our innovation modelis in fact a synthesis
between the urgency to implement concrete solutions in the
short term, mostly driven by current commercial projects, and
the need to develop novel solutions reflecting the changing
macro-scenarios, especially the energy scenario.
This is true where the immediate and already ongoing
objectives concern the reduction of costs and delivery times
to market for Oil&Gas projects, the advancement of further
exploitation of oil and natural gas resources, company
diversification, within, but not limited to, the energy industry,
and environmental protection.
It applies to our direct operations and along our value chain.
Looking towards the mid-long term, our main challenges
are to develop innovative solutions aimed at guaranteeing
full exploitation of Oil&Gas resources in future decades and
contributing to an overall decarbonisation of the sector.
In addition, digitalisation is an option that we are adopting
extensively to increase productivity and increase new value
propositions.
Digitalisation is the implementation and integration
of digital technologies, connectivity and
intelligence in a wide range of devices and work
processes enabling collection and analysis of data in
near-real time to improve performance.
Fast tracking digital technologies represent a fundamental
tool to transform what we do now and the way our industry
will do things in the future, by enhancing productivity,
lowering costs and expanding our proposals to clients.

 

Saipem’s approach to technology and
innovation can be seen in a dualistic
dimension: the first is ‘evolutionary’ and the
second is ‘disruptive’.

DID YOU KNOW?

The ‘evolutionary’ innovation consists of all the technologies
we use every day in our projects and that evolve with the
industry (e.g. digitalisation) and our know-how aiming at
reducing costs and time schedules of the Company's projects.
‘Disruptive’ innovations are those that significantly alter
the way business or entire industries operate; often times,
these technologies force companies to alter the way they
approach their business. This aspect will drive Saipem
through the future.

DID YOU KNOW?

As an example of a short-term result achieved through
a technology innovation, the recently developed
Internal Plasma Welding technology for carbon steel
and clad sealines has been a key factor for the award
of the Barzan project in Qatar. New and even faster
welding and field joint coating techniques, as wellas
exotic and composite materials are under development
to better withstand corrosion, fatigue, high pressure
and high temperature applications.

In the medium-long term, among other things we are
devoted to developing the field of Circular economy:
the exploitation of innovative technological solutions
to treat waste sustainably or residual/opportunity
feedstock from the Oil&Gas and other industries will
become an important asset. Worth mentioning the
License Agreement signed with ITEA (Sofinter Group
company) to produce, through ITEA's proprietary
Isotherm Pwr® ‘Flameless’ Oxy-Combustion
Technology, steam, electricity and pure CO, by flexible
use of low ranking fuels such as waste, heavy oils, pet
coke and several other feedstock. The agreement will
give Saipem access to the technology for Oil&Gas
applications, allowing to offer original and circular
sustainable solutions to the clients.

Specific digital programmes are under development across our divisions:

* The Offshore Drilling and Onshore Drilling divisions are mostly concentrated in the field of digitalisation of operations;
in collaboration with an Oil&Gas major, new approaches based on virtual and augmented reality were launched for
Maintenance & Asset Management (in this respect, a digital twin has been developed for drilling vessels).

* XSIGHT division, in addition to the full development of XDIM™ (see below), is investigating solutions for Industrial
Analytics to provide decision making support to owners of operating plants, allowing for better planning of
productivity and maintenance optimisation with cost reduction and reducing unforeseen plant and equipment
shutdowns which can be turned into shorter and fewer plant stops.

* The Offshore EPC division’s activities are aimed mostly at developing Vessel and Subsea Digital Twins, developing
a data ‘lake’ to support business activities and methods for planning, implementation and management of Offshore

Plants.

+ Finally, for the Onshore EPC division digitalisation is one of the main pillars of a complex Transformation process,

aimed at significantly improving its work processes.
