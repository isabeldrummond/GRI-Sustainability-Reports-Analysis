A CONSTANT COMMITMENT

TO MAKE OUR BUSINESS ENERGY EFFICIENT

Saipem's approach to energy efficiency (and consequently
emissions) has become increasingly more structured

over the years and, since 2013, with the key objectives of
performing energy assessments for offices, vessels and
fabrication yards.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR ITALIAN OFFICES

In 2018, we upgraded our offices in San Donato Milanese, by
installing occupancy sensors for the bathroom and LED lights.

RIG ELECTRIFICATION IN KAZAKHSTAN

The electrification of the rigs began in Kazakhstan in

2017. This new dual configuration (electrical network and
diesel generators) allows the rig to drill without directly
burning any fuel but utilising the local electrical network.
Therefore, since electrical power is produced by a more
efficient and cleaner gas turbine plant, the performance of
the rig, in terms of fuel consumption and GHG emissions,
is significantly improved. For this reason in 2018, it was
decided to continue this process with the electrification of
an additional rig.

Moreover, we started the installation of permanent wi-fi
sensors that will unable Saipem to monitor the energy flow
of its permanent offices through a dedicated dashboard.
The system will be finalised in 2019 and will be a support for
energy assessment and the identification of opportunities
for saving.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR YARDS

During 2018 several energy-saving initiatives were
implemented at yard level.

The Ambriz yard (Angola) focused on the following initiatives:
switching off electricity in accommodations during working
hours, replacing the electrical air compressor witha
mechanical one provided on request, improving the GenSet
load and reducing the amount of travels to Luanda and Soyo.
Also the Boscongo yard (Congo) improved its energy
performance, increasing the amount of electricity taken from
public networks.

At the SCNL yard (Nigeria), 115 additional LED floodlights
were installed in the yard's external areas and perimeter.

The STAR yard (Saudi Arabia) further increased its power
production efficiency by means of a new GenSet which
