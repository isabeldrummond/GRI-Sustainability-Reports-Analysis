SAFETY FOR OUR PEOPLE

LEADERSHIP IN HEALTH & SAFETY:
TAKING THE NEW HEALTH & SAFETY VISION
INTO THE NEXT DECADE

We continue the systematic global implementation of our
Leadership in Health & Safety (LiHS) programme, launched

in 2007 and designed to develop a cultural change and
significantly reduce accidents and injuries. The end of 2017
saw the release of the new Saipem Health and Safety Vision
and the challenge throughout 2018 was to transmit it around
the Saipem world, engaging the population with the new
target through both a top down anda bottom up approach.
What happened in the Offshore E&C division is a concrete
example of this top down approach: after a workshop
celebrating ten years of LIHS sponsored by our CEO Stefano
Cao, the echoes of this initiative involved the Division Chief
Operating Officer, his first reports and managers to reenergise
the implementation of the LiHS programme, reconnect with its
values and define and clarify the future commitments toward
the new Vision for Health and Safety. As aresult, 7 events and
about 140 managers reconsolidated the principle of LIHS and
explored new tools and ideas on how to inspire other Safety
leaders creating a circle of trust.

  

oo Quite inspirational and definitely an eye-opener.
It has made me more Safety conscious and
more importantly taught me to inspire and lead
by example with regard to the safety concept.

On the other hand, as an example of bottom-up engagement,
acompetition to enable participants to demonstrate what
the new Health & Safety vision really meant to them in their
own working reality was launched. Participants were invited
to use their creative skills and develop a short movie, in which
the messages in the vision were ‘brought to life’ in a new

and innovative way. With the yearlong strategy to internalise
and embed the new vision through the organisation, the
competition submissions will be utilised through 2019 to

maintain focus and feed Saipem’s passion for health and
safety.

The LiHS programme has always been applied successfully
not only at Saipem but also outside our own operating
boundaries: the Barzan Pipeline Project is an example of this
since the client, project management team, subcontractors
and suppliers came together to define the Barzan Pipeline
Project Health and Safety Vision. The aim was to ensure safe
operations, compliance with rules and regulations, workforce
empowerment and motivation to achieve excellence in key
performance indicators, and zero tolerance philosophy in
this framework.

A DAY IN A YARD: THE HSE DAY

The Yard HSE Day workshop, held in November in Paris,
was designed to create an opportunity for the yard and
construction management to look, think and commit to
safety with a more in depth understanding.

The day was a first-hand experience providing an emotional
moment of reflection on the barriers preventing yards from
achieving zero accidents and how new and old tools can be
