COMMITMENT

Gradually reduce
dependence on the fossil
fuels business focusing
onless climate-impacting
fields, investing in
renewable technologies,
and developing more
sustainable fossil fuel
uses and diversifying
activities.

Optimise energy
consumption and
investigate renewable
energy sources.

Reinforce safety process,
culture and competencies
held by our people,
including those of
vendors.

Run safe operations

for people and the
environment and ensure
integrity of assets.

Reduce and mitigate

the environmental

risk associated with

oil and chemical spills,
ensuring that appropriate
prevention and response
measures are in place.

Align Saipem’s business
offer to business needs
and the market scenario.

 

2018 RESULTS

2019 OBJECTIVES

* Implement the actions
defined in the Strategic
plan, setting an overall
target to reduce GHG
emissions by 120 kt CO,eq
within 2022 (2017 baseline),
and monitoring the results
obtained.

Fine-tune the Strategic
plan considering the first
results obtained.

Continue to perform
energy and GHG reduction
assessments.

OHSAS 18001 certification
to the new ISO 45001:2018
standard on Occupational
health and safety
management systems.
Improve the Total
Recordable Incident
Frequency Rate (TRIFR).

Monitor the implementation
of asset integrity KPls across
Divisions.

Correctly map critical oil spill
areas on vessels/drilling rigs/
fabrication yards/projects
and address them in the
relevant documentation.

* Pursue disruptive
innovation solutions.

+ Maintain the high
investment in technology
