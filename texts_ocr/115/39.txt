PUSHING BEYOND
THE FRONTIERS OF

The world is seeing an accelerated rate of change,

where a multitude of complex global scenarios

with a high degree of uncertainty, such as fast evolving technologies,
demographics and global warming, impact business.

The Oil & Gas industry is experiencing a transformation

of its complex system as well.

The period ranging from 2000 to 2014 was characterised by colossal
investments, driven by high oil prices, but showing

a significant lack of overall productivity in the industry.

On the other hand, although the continuous increase

of the world population and hydrocarbon demand, the entire industry
is wondering how to search for, transform and exploit sustainable fossil
sources in a planet that will have to be liveable and clean.
Consequently, the Oil&Gas industry needs to renew its focus sharply
in order to cope both with immediate and future challenges.

Saipem put itself in this framework to play its strategic role

as an innovative Solutions Provider.
