The following principles have been used to identify the
contents of the document: stakeholder inclusiveness,
sustainability context, materiality and completeness.

To guarantee the quality of the information contained in

balance, reliability and timeliness were followed, again as

The reportis published annually and is approved by the
managerial Sustainability Committee, the Sustainability,
Scenarios and Governance Committee and the Board of

Directors. It is distributed at the Shareholders’ Meeting
convened to approve the Annual Report.

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS

In order to define the sustainability themes considered
most significant, both within the Company and in relation to
stakeholders, a materiality analysis was once again carried
out in 2018, hence for the eighth year running.

The first step entailed identifying the significant aspects
which are considered in the analysis in order to pinpoint
those that are material. Identification is based on the
sustainability context and on the analysis of the stakeholders
involved. In order to simplify analysis and comparison of
results, the 27 topics identified were broken down into

6 macro categories: (i) Environmental Management and
Impacts, (ii) Business Conduct and Operations, (iii) Safe
Operations, (iv) People Management, (v) Human Rights,
Diversity and Well-being and (vi) Local Presence and Support.

The level of external interest was defined by interviewing

and surveying a representative mix of external stakeholders,
in terms of types of organisation (16 clients, 6 local
community/NGO representatives, 45 business partners and
vendors, 9 business association representatives, 14 financial
stakeholders, 5 insurance partners and 7 government and
regulator representatives) and geographic focus (10%
international, 38% from Europe, 12% from CIS, 22% from the
Middle East area, 9% from Africa, 5% from the Americas, and
4% from the Asia-Pacific area).

The results were integrated with the outcomes of the
surveys delivered to Saipem’s employees, collecting
feedback from more than 4,300 people. In order to define the
level of internal significance, an additional survey was sent to

all Saipem senior managers. More than 180 senior managers
contributed identifying sustainability priorities for the
long-term success of the Company. The materiality analysis
results were approved by the managerial Sustainability
Committee in late 2018.
