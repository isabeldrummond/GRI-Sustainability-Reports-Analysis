With regard to human rights and taking into consideration
regulations and their evolution, the specificity of business
areas of the international contexts in which we operate and
of employed technologies, efforts to ensure the security of
people (and company asset) are among top priorities and
guarantee a secure environment for operations and people
living near them.

Company Security is defined as the activity, in line

with UNI 10459-2015, aimed at preventing,

managing and overcoming events that may occur
following illegal actions and that expose company
personnel and assets (tangible and intangible) to potential
harmful and/or damaging effects.

Inthe management of security activities, Saipem gives
utmost importance to respecting human rights. As stated

in the Security Management System Guideline, security
activities are conducted in compliance with the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, relevant national and
international regulations and Voluntary Principles on
Security and Human Rights. The respect of human dignity

is a fundamental value that cannot be violated in any way.

All security personnel protecting Saipem employees and
installations shall respect these principles.

We are committed to adopting preventive measures aimed
at minimising the need for response by public/private
security forces in the case of any threats to the safety of our
people and the integrity of our assets. We manage relations
with local security forces in order to ensure a shared
commitment to human rights, as well as the adoption of rules
of engagement that limit the use of force. Before signing
acontract, vendors of security goods and services are
subjected to due diligence to verify that there are no
counter-indications connected with the violation of human
rights.

Since 2010, we have introduced clauses regarding the
respect for human rights in our contracts with these vendors,
and failure to observe them leads to the withdrawal of the
Company from the contract. As of today, the contractual

SECURITY AND HEALTH PRE-TRAVEL INDUCTION

clauses on human rights have been included in the ‘General
terms and conditions’ of contracts.

For new projects in which Saipem is responsible for security,
we Carry out a Security Risk Assessment on the country

in question before initiating a tender process. If Saipem
decides to go ahead with issuing a call for bids, we prepare
the Project Security Execution Plan in which the security
risk connected with the operating activities and the context
is analysed, including human rights violation issues.

The actions required to manage and reduce these toa
minimum are decided based on the risks identified.

In 2014, we launched an internal awareness training
programme called HOPE (Human OPerational Environment),
specifically targeted at managers working at the operative
level at sites and projects in the Operations, Human
Resources, HSE, Security and Community Relations
functions. The programme is aimed at helping the functions
identify appropriate managerial and behavioural solutions in
managing all human rights issues that may arise during their
day-to-day activities. Therefore, it is specifically focused on
each local context, analysing the social, ethical and cultural
context of the area of operations, and itis designed to be an
interactive guide to the process of decision making in case
of conflicts.

Due to the global evolution of the Cyber threat, a technical/
organisational action plan was defined. The action plan
includes, for example, the establishment of a unit dedicated
to the management of Cyber Security, and it is aimed at
strengthening IT security safeguards within Saipem Group.
