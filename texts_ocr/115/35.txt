INSPIRING SAFETY ACROSS ITALY

The Safety Leadership Event (LSE) is the national

event for Italia Loves Sicurezza, the movement that has
produced over 1,000 events all across Italy in recent
years to make workers, students and citizens aware of
health and safety issues using non-conventional language
based on the principles of participation and engagement.
The third and latest edition of the SLE focused on the
theme of choice, in other words the ability to get out

of your comfort zone by choosing always to safeguard
health and safety. The day saw the participation of our
Top Management and five leaders from major Italian
companies, and the screening of the film ‘Choose Life’

(a film that won two prizes at the Cannes Film Festival).

It was also the opportunity to present work done by the
Universita Cattolica di Milano to validate scientifically the
Leadership in Health & Safety method, created by Saipem
and shared with the industry through the LHS Foundation.

The emotions in the accounts, the storytelling, it
was in this way that the wave of change spread.
Storytelling is a method that awakens the most

unconscious part of ourselves, the most creative and
rebellious part. Thanks to these resources change
can receive this decisive impulse.

 

CHOICE, NOT CHANCE - DROPPED OBJECTS
CAMPAIGN

In 2016, we launched a Dropped Objects Campaign (DROPS)
aiming at reducing the number of dropped objects incidents.
During 2017 the evaluation of innovative approaches

to support the implementation of the campaign and its
effectiveness, especially surrounding human aspects,
started. The approach developed was to invert the negative
choice to take a chance, and to instil a ‘drive’ in people to
make a positive choice. The key tool developed was a video
called ‘Choice not Chance’ to reach the audience: emotional
involvement increases the effectiveness of engagement
significantly, guiding the audience to take positive actions
whenever planning and operating at height. By reaching for
an emotional connection, the film emphasizes the need for
control elements to be in place, as well as the importance of
complying with them. Saipem’s implementation of the film
within the dropped objects campaign, and the effects such
media has on its audience, represent an innovative strategy
for the industry.

DROPS campaign in the Offshore division

To better internalise the DROPS philosophy into our culture, a
series of DROPS surveys, consisting of thorough inspection
and recording of all items and equipment, which might

fall, were carried out to establish an effective preventive
system. The surveys were performed through inspections
on 4 vessels of our fleet (S7000, FDS, FDS 2 and Khankendi
Subsea Construction Vessel) and in 2 yards (STAR in Saudi
Arabia and Karimun in Indonesia). Furthermore, two training
sessions for DROPS focal points were delivered involving 12

Growing New Leaders in Safety, now in its third year, is
a training programme composed of several laboratories
aimed at children and teenagers, from 3 to 18 years of
age, with the goal of stimulating reflection on the theme
of health and safety, promoting more correct and positive
behaviours for themselves and for others. The project is
also aimed at primary school teachers who learn how to
conduct an experiential workshop focused on the topics
of Leadership in Health & Safety. Growing New Leaders in
Safety is not just a programme for schools, but has also
been integrated into Saipem's internal communications
activities.

people operating in yards, vessels and projects. The main
goal of this session was to enable the focal points to train the
site operational workgroup and sustain the vessel and yard
management in cascading the knowledge and awareness on
the matter through all levels of the organisation.

A PERFECT DAY IN SAIPEM

In correspondence with the celebration of the World day for
Health and Safety, the Perfect Day ‘concept’ was launched
as part of our vision of zero accidents. The objective is

to change the traditional mind-set of health, safety and
environment into a dynamic and positive holistic approach,
focused on delivering excellence in safety performance,
protection of the environment, and asset preservation each
and every day.

Employees are invited to think that what they do at work
today can have a direct impact on how they will enjoy life
tomorrow.

To us Perfect Day means that all employees and
our contractors go home safely, the environment
is not harmed, and no damage to assets is
recorded. This includes no injuries, and no serious
environmental spills or releases, no damage to our assets,
and no high potential near misses.
At the end of the working day, the announcement of
another perfect day is spread throughout the project site.
The performance of this initiative is measured by tracking, on
a daily and monthly basis the number of perfect days.
In 2018, results are noteworthy and a total number of 167
perfect days were recorded in the Offshore division.
