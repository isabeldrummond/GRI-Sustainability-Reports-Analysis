INNOVATE AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE
Technologies and innovation are among the keys for reducing
our own CO, emissions. To this end two main actions are
being addressed: running business operations maximising
energy efficiency (implementing specific assessment to
identify and develop innovative energy efficiency initiatives
applied to vessels and yards), and focusing on digital
transformation (changing how the Company works to

boost productivity and chase new value propositions). Most
importantly, to enlarge the offer to our clients in less climate-
impacting fields acting as an innovative solutions provider,
further fields are the object of investigation: renewables and
energy storage (hydrogen), a sustainable use of ‘necessary’
fossil fuels and the design of new hybrid configurations.
Interms of renewables, the technology efforts are mostly
dedicated to concentrated solar and bio-refineries (as

an example, Saipem signed an exclusive agreement with
California Ethanol & Power LIc, for the realisation of a

low carbon emission plant for the production of ethanol,
electricity, bio-methane and other secondary products from
renewable sources), to new solutions for advanced wind farms
and floating solar parks, emerging marine technologies such
as wave and tidal, energy storage and hydrogen as a clean
energy carrier produced by water with renewable energy.
Regarding the second point, Natural Gas is the cleanest and
least CO,-emitting fossil source and will play a relevant role in

the energy transition. We are carrying out several efforts in the

LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) sector:

* to define proprietary small scale liquefaction and
re-gasification of Natural Gas, showing good promise for
becominga flexible tool to support sustainable mobility in
the near future;

* to develop Floating LNG (FLNG), including the new
Liqueflex™ technology.

Efforts are continuing to keep our Snamprogetti™ Urea

Technology at the highest level of competitiveness, also

by decreasing energy consumption and reducing the

environmental impact through highly innovative solutions.

Atthe same time, innovative activities are being designed for

the reduction of Gas Flaring.

Furthermore, the capability to manage the CO, value chain

becomes mandatory with the final aim of continuing to exploit

the fossil fuels but definitely reducing the related emissions.

In this framework, our activities focus on mastering the

whole Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) chain, pursuing

CO, re-utilisation options, scouting emerging CO, capture

technologies and building a distinctive technology portfolio.

The application of novel hybrid approaches is based on

the adoption of renewable technologies applied to the

development of Oil&Gas operations. It will be fruitful to lower
the overall CO, emissions and many concepts are under
investigation.

Saipem Emission Estimation Methodology is aligned

with the most important International Standards for the
calculation of air emissions and it has been certified since
2011 by a third party in accordance with the principles of
ISO 14064 ‘Greenhouse gases’.

In 2018, the Saipem methodology was updated and
increased its boundaries of application, accounting also N,O
emissions, and their contribution to direct GHG emissions.
For the first time we included indirect GHG emissions in our

certified methodology, including the GHG deriving from

the combustion of the fuel used to produce electricity that
Saipem purchases (Scope 2 emissions) and starting the
process of calculating Saipem’s Scope 3 emissions, by
including GHG deriving from employee air travel for business.
The certification covers the internally developed software
for emission calculation.

The new methodology will be officially applied from 2018
data onwards.
