QUANTIFYING THE VALUE WE GENERATE

Saipem's business model contributes to creating long-term
value for the communities in which we live and operate and
society as awhole. That is the foundation of our sustainability
strategy and of our sense of purpose.

Since 2009, our Saipem Externalities Local Content
Evaluation (SELCE) Model has quantified the comprehensive
value of our operations in a certain area or country where we
operate or of projects we have completed. Three categories of
output are investigated — economic, employment and human
capital development — and their direct, indirect and induced
impacts are quantified. The result is a multiplier effect

of Saipem’s expenditures and investments in the local
economy.

In 2018, we applied the model to quantify the
socio-economic externalities associated with Saipem's
activities in Norway between 2014 and 2018. The average
contribution of Saipem’s activities to Norwegian GDP in
2014-2017 was 0.08% with a peak of 0.10% in 2014.
