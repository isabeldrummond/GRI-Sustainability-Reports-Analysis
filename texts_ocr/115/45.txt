Competitiveness requires responsibility.

We have always been committed to conducting business in accordance
with the highest integrity standards, carrying out our activities with loyalty
and transparency, in full compliance with laws and regulations,

and the values contained in our code of ethics.

As a responsible employer, we respect international human and labour
values and principles, and are committed to promoting positive behaviour
even outside our own operational boundaries, across our supply chain
and in the communities in which we operate.

We are aware that the creation of a context of reciprocal respect and trust
between the company, employees and our stakeholders is an essential
aspect to run our sustainable business.
