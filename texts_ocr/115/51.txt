VENDORS: PARTNERS IN THE CHAIN
FOR A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS

Saipem conducts its business availing itself of the collaboration
and cooperation of qualified vendors with which long lasting
relationships and cooperation have been established over

the years. Strengthened by the Saipem Ethical Supply Chain
Management System, the Company believes that only through
business relationships with vendors, founded on reciprocal
trust and honourable behaviour, it is possible to achieve
success in every business project.

While providing equal business opportunities, Saipem
selects suppliers and subcontractors based on the policy
of open competition. The Vendor Management System
identifies priority sustainable topics for the supply chain:
the ethical behaviour of the vendors, their respect of Human
and Labour Rights, the Health and Safety protection of their
employees and the environmental protection.

All those sustainable aspects are integrated in the Vendor
Management System in three different interrelated phases,
which can be summarised as follows:

1. Vendor qualification;

2. Purchase Document preparation and award;

3. Vendor performance monitoring and feedback.

Vendors with which Saipem has successfully
and continuously collaborated for 10 years

 

Vendors are selected based on a structured vendor
qualification process that analyses their reliability from
technical, financial, quality, HSE, managerial point of view

and from an ethical and sustainable point of view. Vendors
belonging to countries classified as critical from the Human
and Labour Rights point of view, are assessed on the basis

of information and documents provided on issues such

as child and forced labour, freedom of association and the
right to collective bargaining, remuneration, discrimination,
disciplinary practices and working hours. Similarly, for
commodity codes with high HSE risk, an ad hoc assessment
is carried out to analyse the vendor HSE management system
and its ability to manage these aspects.

In the case of specific critical commodity codes, the assessment
carries out a further deep counter-party evaluation that

analyses aspects relevant to operating and financial data and
organisational aspects. A detailed check is also implemented on
the ownership structures and any possible presence of politically
exposed persons and/or members of the Company with alleged
involvement directly/indirectly in any offence, in compliance with

50

Saipem’s anti-corruption guidelines. Depending on the vendor's
criticality and on the specific commodity code, the qualification
process may also require an audit visit, which consists of an
on-site verification of the vendor activities. Vendors operating in
high-risk countries with regard to Human Rights may be subject
to anassessment visit also regarding labour rights aspects.

The scope of the audit focuses on child and forced labour,
freedom of association and on the right to collective bargaining,
remuneration, working hours, discrimination, disciplinary
practices, and health and safety. The results of the audits carried
outin 2018 on those topics showed no major criticalities, while
some non-conformities were found during the assessments
performed for vendors operating in the Manpower Services field:
one of them was in the end blockedin the vendor management
system as a consequence of the non-conformity found.

STRENGTHENING THE HSE COMPETENCE
OF OUR SUBCONTRACTORS

Safety wise, being proactive means implementing all the
safety measures, initiatives and activities that prevent
incidents to employees and any direct subcontractors.
Saipem pushed this definition of proactivity to a further
level, involving all business partners in creating awareness
and sharing the best practices and lessons learned in HSE.
Aselection of these initiatives is reported below.

Aware of the criticalities occurred during pipe handling
operations over the past years, Saipem developed the

Safe Pipe Handling Campaign. The initiative is addressed
to suppliers and to anyone else involved in pipe handling
operations, conscious of the fact that the sharing of the best
practices, know-how and lessons learnt raises alertness and
maintains the required due diligence and proper involvement
of all line management and workforce during such hazardous
pipe and material handling activities. In August 2018, for the
Barzan Pipeline Project (Qatar), Saipem organised workshops
for 4 supplier representatives to share lessons learned and
best practices in Pipe-handling operations, in line with the
Saipem Project LSR Programme and with the Project Health
and Safety Vision. Afterwards, all suppliers’ employees were
then involved in the campaign through dedicated cascading
meetings and through toolbox talks at the job sites. To ensure
proper roll out of the campaign, they had to provide feedback
