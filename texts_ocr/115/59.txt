HEALTH AWARENESS AND PROMOTION IN THE WORKPLACE

For the fifth year running, Saipem has taken part in the Workplace Health Promotion (WHP) programme as result of the
joint efforts of employers, workers and local institutions. Its aim is to improve health and well-being in the workplace by
adopting best practices in the field of health promotion: Saipem was awarded for reaching the programme's goals by the
regional government of Lombardy. The programme is founded on the principles of promoting health in the workplace by
encouraging organisational changes that ensure an environment open to the conscious adoption and dissemination of

healthy lifestyles, contributing to the prevention of the NCDs.

The trend of malaria cases recorded on Saipem worksites
reached a plateau in 2018 compared with 2017, as well as
the Overall Malaria Cases Rate: zero malaria-related deaths
among Saipem workers and subcontractors was reported.

Worksites monitored

 

In Angola the Malaria Control programme continued in 2018,
providing preventive measures on the worksites, as well as to
the local communities. New local communities were involved
in the campaign which consists of regular indoor residual
spraying and fumigations (3 sessions), training programmes
in properly diagnosing malaria through laboratory analysis
for 20 technicians and an advanced training course in the
management and treatment of malaria cases for 25 nurses.
The campaign is implemented together with local health
departments.

Beneficiaries

 

Strengthening the skills of local medical staff was an
important matter in Congo too where, together with a local

CO

association and the Health Ministry, a training programme was
delivered to medical staff with the final aim of improving the
health conditions of the population.

Health personnel trained

 

In Bolivia, near the area where a Saipem rigis located, a public
health conference was organised to promote awareness on the
importance of the application of preventive practices of healthy
lifestyles and hygiene. The key point was the prevention of
diseases with higher prevalence in children under 5 years of age.
This activity consisted of teaching and reinforcing the basic
principles of personal hygiene, washing hands, oral hygiene,
the use of home remedies to prevent seasonal diseases.

Adults and children took part in the workshop
