1am pleased to renew Saipem's commitment to support the UN Global Compact in 2019: we have been an active player
since 2016 and we have worked to make this initiative and its principles part of our business strategy, day-to-day
operations and organisational culture. Every year we aim to strengthen our effort in all our spheres of influence to
protect and respect human rights and international labour standards, safeguard the environment and fight corruption.
Furthermore, since our business partners play an important role in making our business sustainable, increasing attention

is dedicated to promote the respect for the Ten Principles also along our supply chain, contributing to advancing
sustainable development together. This renewed commitment is concrete proof of our willingness to be a leader striving
for constant progress while meeting our stakeholders expectations.
