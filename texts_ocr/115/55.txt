ATTRACTION, DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION

TO MAKE OUR PEOPLE THE KEY ASSET

In achallenging and competitive industry, where professionalism,
reliability and expertise are the benchmark for our operations,
the attraction, development and retention of people represents
key levers in our business strategy. Learning programmes are
promoted to ensure the development of professional know-

how and behavioural skills for all our people, guaranteeing equal
growth opportunities for all on the basis of merit and without
discrimination. On the other hand, we want to be forefront to
attract future and experienced talents with special attention to
students or undergraduates close to the labour market.

Since its announcement in 2015, the Saipem Leadership
Model has become the basis of all human resources
processes. The Modelis inspired by six principles/pillars —
People, Vision, Communication, Decision making, Knowledge,
Integrity — each linked with skills and behaviours that inspire
our people. Since the inception of the model, one of the main
focuses of the HR department has been to increase the
awareness and knowledge of the model itself throughout the
whole company. To achieve this goal, the Managerial Academy
consists of different training courses, each regarding one
aspect of the model, aiming to provide our people with the
opportunity of improving their behavioural skills, thus helping
them to achieve their development goals.
Asecond pillar in people developmentis Succession Planning, a
strategic process that allows the identification and development
of talents suitable to cover strategic positions in the medium and
long term. The process starts with the definition of an expected
profile, consisting of responsibilities, experiences, know-how
and strategic goals of the target position. A shortlist of internal
candidates is identified, including skill and experience mapping.
The final steps of the process are arisk assessment and a
contingency plan (i.e. external market scouting, training paths,
mobility actions, growth towards more complex roles).
