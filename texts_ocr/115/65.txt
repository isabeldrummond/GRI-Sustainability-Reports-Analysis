Therefore, the extent of work performed in our examination was lower than that required for a full
examination according to the ISAE 3000 Revised ("reasonable assurance engagement") and, hence,
it does not provide assurance that we have become aware of all significant matters and events that
would be identified during a reasonable assurance engagement.

The procedures performed on the Report were based on our professional judgment and included
inquiries, primarily with Company's personnel responsible for the preparation of the information
included in the Report, documents analysis, recalculations and other procedures in order to obtain
evidences considered appropriate.

In particular, we have performed the following procedures:

e Analysis, through interviews, of the governance system and management process of the issues
related to the sustainable development regarding the Group's strategy and operations;

e Analysis of the process relating to the definition of material aspects included in the Report, with
reference to the criteria applied to identify priorities for the different stakeholders categories and
to the internal validation of the process outcomes;

e@ Understanding of the processes that lead to the generation, detection and management of
significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the Report.

In particular, we have conducted interviews and discussions with the management of Saipem
S.p.A. and we have performed limited documentary evidence procedures, in order to collect
information about the processes and procedures that support the collection, aggregation,
processing and transmission of data and information to the department responsible for the
preparation of the Report.

e Furthermore, for significant information, considering the Group's activities and characteristics:

- at Group level

a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the Report, we carried out
inquiries and acquired supporting documentation to verify its consistency with the

and limited assurance procedures to ascertain on a sample basis the correct aggregation
of data.

procedures and the calculation methods used to determine the indicators.
