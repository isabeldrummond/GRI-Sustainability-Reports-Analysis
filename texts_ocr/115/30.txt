concurred with lower specific oil consumption.

In 2018, the ERSAI yard (Kazakhstan) continued the
implementation of its action plan for energy saving and
efficiency: the replacement of old fluorescent, incandescent
and arc mercury lamps with LED lights and the installation
of new ones. In 2018, the lighting system was improved
replacing additional 8,000 lamps with LED lights.

The expected energy saving due to the implementation of
the initiative is about 1,600 MWh/year that is equal to 751
tonnes of GHG per year. Also the new part of the training
centre, built using efficient construction materials and
building technologies, contributed to achieving the highest
efficiency, contributing to an annual saving of 22.41 MWh
and 10 tonnes of GHG.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF OFFSHORE VESSELS

For years, we have implemented an initiative for route
optimisation of our offshore and drilling vessels through

the use of route optimisation software. The best route is
detected each day by taking weather conditions and marine
currents into consideration. Route optimisation has become
a regular and good practice within our organisation since

all masters of our fleet are required to use the dedicated
software during transits on routes with medium or high
potential (transoceanic routes with medium or high potential
of economic and environmental benefits).

In 2018, the software was used for 8 voyages by 6 vessels,
with the following results.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY
IN AL ZOUR REFINERY PROJECT

In 2018, Al Zour Refinery Project in Kuwait saw a joint
commitment with subcontractors to implement energy
efficiency initiatives. One example is the Sun Light initiative.
The latest photovoltaic technology, a solar powered barrier
warning light package, was used, in line with the following
economic and environmental benefits:

* Utilisation of solar energy, which is free.

* Maintenance and cost free up to 3 years.

« Reduces removal of non-functional lights.

« Reduces expensive battery replacement.

* Cost savings of battery disposal.

Asecond initiative is the Saipem eco Operations (SeO)
Campaign, launched in 2018 to monitor and bring to light

all the best practices that can be implemented on each
vessel, leading to savings in terms of fuel and reduced GHG
emissions. The campaign consists of different phases:

the energy assessment to identify SeO; launching of the
campaign on-board; focal point and workgroup identification;
cascading to the full crew; SeO implementation and
reporting / Feedback and Review. All the implementable
best practices are identified during the first phase: the
energy assessments are indeed crucial since they assess
all the energy uses of the vessel, area by area, to determine
the breakdown of consumption, to identify and analyse the
feasibility of possible energy efficiency measures.

As third example, construction vessels are improving

their lighting system, with a 4-year LED replacement plan.
Among the fleet, Castoro 10 has already taken the first steps,
starting to switch to LED for the illumination of winch rooms:
since implementation, this has reduced on board lighting
energy demand by 3.5 MWh and, consequently, saved 0.89
tonnes of fuel and 2.77 tonnes of CO,.
