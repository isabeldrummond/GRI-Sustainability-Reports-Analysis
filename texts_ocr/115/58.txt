VALUING HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

Health prevention, protection and promotion are one of the
priority objectives for our company. Since cardiovascular
diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of major

cardiovascular accidents including repatriation and mortality,

Saipem's commitment and activity is particularly focused on
systematically addressing their risk factors: elevated blood
pressure, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking, raised blood
sugar and physical inactivity. Their modification concurs to
prevent cardiovascular accidents. For this reason a Cardio
Vascular Disease Prevention (CVDP) programme has been
implemented across all our sites. The programme includes
general awareness sessions about cardiovascular risk
factors, screening of employees for cardiovascular risks,
identification of employees with elevated cardiovascular
risks and their systematic monitoring, treatment follow-up
and surveillance, provision of platform for information,
education and training sessions.

Worksites covered

 

In this framework, particular attention has always been paid

to programmes such as:

« Weight control and obesity prevention. The prevalence of
overweight and obesity has become one of the most critical
health issues worldwide and in Saipem too. To address
this, we have implemented this prevention programme,
which requires the measurement of Body Mass Index
(BMI) and waist circumference of the entire workforce with
the identification of overweight and obese employees. If
identified, they have to attend seminars where they are
educated on healthy lifestyle modifications and are givena
‘healthy weight ten-week challenge’ handouts to follow.

Worksites covered

 

* Stop smoking. The campaign is based on trans-theoretical
model of behavioural change, which takes the smoker
progressively through 5 stages of life changing habits:
starts with no intention to change habits, to become
aware that problems exist, then the intention to change,
followed by actions to prevent relapse. The programme is
highly interactive, with perspective-changing exercises,

using cognitive behavioural approach and neurolinguistics
programming tools. Itis structured in 4 phases consisting
of lectures, activities and counselling delivered in 2-hour
workshops.

Worksites involved in the campaign between 2015-2018

 

* Telecardiology. It is a platform for second opinions and
readings of ECG reports, warranted by our site medical
staff to put a diagnosis or derive a differential diagnosis of
cardiovascular diseases.

HEALTH AWARENESS AND PROMOTION
IN SENSITIVE AREAS

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites

that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected
female Anopheles mosquitoes. Although it is preventable and
curable, in 2017, there were an estimated 219 million cases of
malaria in 90 countries, causing more than 400,000 deaths.
The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high
share of the global malaria burden. In 2017, the region was
home to 92% of malaria cases and 93% of malaria deaths’.
Strongly committed to fighting this disease, Saipem has
implemented a Malaria Control Programme to monitor
Saipem worksites, their workforce and subcontractors.

The A-B-C-D methodology of Saipem Malaria Control
Programme consists in:

‘A - Awareness - Malaria awareness lectures and refresher
courses.

‘B' - Bite - Efforts to combat mosquito bites through weed
control, external fumigations, and use of mosquito nets and
repellents.

‘C'- Chemoprophylaxis - Medicines available to non-immune
employees.

‘D' - Diagnosis and Early Treatment - Rapid Diagnosis
Available in all sites, tests are performed in case of
suspected malaria and, if positive, are sent to laboratory,
when these are reachable, for confirmatory test. Anti-malaria
drugs are immediately given to confirmed cases.
