developed by the HSE department and can supportin the
elimination of those barriers.

Six HSE tools were explored during the day: HSE training, Task
familiarisation cards and on-the-job training, Self-verification,
Supervisor HSE performance evolution, Competence
assessment, Life Saving Rules management walkabout toolkit.

One of the best practices of the day:

the HSE performance evaluation programme

for supervisors and superintendents

The programme was launched at Saipem Indonesia Karimun
premises in September 2016 aimed at keeping safety
standards at the highest level, promoting a constant focus and
boosting the safety commitment from all levels of hierarchy.
The HSE performance evaluation is based on acriteria

that includes the following HSE parameters: the number

of personnel injuries that occurred, attendance to the HSE
training courses, management walkaround, toolbox talking
(TBT) participation, and number of SHOC card issuance

by the team. Between 2017 and 2018 the programme was
extended to supervisors and superintendents and new
parameters added (i.e. number of disciplinary measures
issued, permit to work correct implementation, PPE
compliance, environmental criteria).

The HSE performance evaluation is carried out ona monthly
basis for all yard supervisors and superintendents, monitored
and compared with the yard HSE TRI Frequency rate: it was
noted that positive HSE performance of supervisors and
superintendents led to a decrease in the yard TRI frequency
rate and vice versa. In this framework Karimun yard saw higher
involvement in training courses, an increase of supervisor
accountability, an improvement of the safety culture onthe
yard, a better sharing of unsafe acts and lessons learnt during
monthly HSE meetings and a constant focus on safety. All these
results contributed to the success of the HSE performance
evaluation tool and, once shared during the Yard HSE Day, it was
decided to implementit in all Saipem yards starting from 2019.

THE LIFE SAVING RULES CAMPAIGN:
THE WALKABOUT TOOL

The Saipem Life Saving Rules (LSR) campaign, launched

in late 2015, is the customised gold standard for safety
compliance within Saipem. In 2017, the development of a new
tool, the LSR management walkabout, began and in 2018, the
efficiency of its implementation was assessed. For example,
in Nigeria at the SCNL yard, the successful implementation of
this new tool was due to the systematic approach consisting
of three phases: pre-walkabout meeting, during walkabout
meeting, post walkabout meeting.

During the pre-walkabout meeting the area of the walkabout
and an overview of the related activities and associated

risks were defined. Then dedicated checklists focused on
specific LSR were used to gather information regarding the
work environment, competence and knowledge in relation

to application of the rules, compliance of documentation
available on site. Two walkabouts were organised in the

fabrication yard, testing the following LSR: dropped objects,
seat belt, suspended load, confined space and gas testing.
During the post-walkabout meeting, all the observations
issued during the walkabout were collected and discussed,
anda checklist was prepared with actions assigned to the
function in charge.

Implementing the Life Saving Rules management walkabout
tool gave yard management the opportunity to identify any
gaps in the yard management systems, and to intervene as
quickly as possible ensuring the continuous improvement of
the HSE management systems.

ENHANCING INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE
AT THE SCHIEDAM TRAINING CENTRE

The Schiedam Training Centre is a competence hub set up

in 2012 in the Netherlands to coordinate several complex
HSE training courses. Since competence and knowledge
become highly critical when it comes to safety, initiatives
shall also focus on strengthening the technical, operational
and communication skills of the HSE professionals who train
and coach people operating on-board our vessels and in our
sites.
In this framework the HSE competence programme was
internally designed relying on the experience and knowledge
of Saipem HSE operation management and involving the
most senior HSE professionals and trainers. The training
course has a good balance between theory and practice,
particularly when it comes to topics like Confined space,
Working at height and Asbestos training in which first-hand
experience is fundamental to build up the confidence and
skills necessary to perform the task. From a practical point of
view, this is possible thanks to Confined space and Working
at height simulators. However, since communication plays

a critical role inthe HSE competence programme, specific
modules on training the trainers and public speaking
opportunities are disseminated throughout the course.

The programme started at the end of 2017, reached its 7
session and has seen more than 80 people involved so

far. The feedback is mostly enthusiastic not only for the
technical benefits that everyone recognised but also for

the opportunity to share experiences, concerns and stories
which help to create connections between people.
