Astrong and focused materiality assessment is the cornerstone of a sustainability
strategy that is consistent with the core business, meets stakeholder expectations and
produces high-impact results both for Saipem and for society.

Materiality is about identifying the issues that are meaningful for our stakeholders and
us, and that are within our capacity to create long-term value to support the Company's
strategy. We plot the issues that we consider important for our long-term business
success against those that pose risks or opportunities to the Company.
