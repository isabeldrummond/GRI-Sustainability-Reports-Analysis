BEST PRACTICES
FROM ONSHORE PROJECTS

In the Tangguh Expansion Project,
the spill prevention and response
plan established will be able

to protect the various existing

ecological resources, company

facilities and to prevent any issues
within the community. Since the
spill events occurred in the project
came from equipment failure and
improper storage, a strategy was
developed:

* Administration Strategy:
identifying the spill risk from
construction activities.

* Spill prevention strategy:
promoting preventive
maintenance, placing dip trays

APPLYING TECHNOLOGY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

under equipment, replacing oil
and refuelling activities using
dip trays and conducting regular
inspections at the existing
facilities.

« Readiness strategy: providing
spill kits, delivering training
and conducting spill drills and
exercises.

SCNL in Nigeria took all reasonable
steps to prevent accidental release
of materials to the environment
that could lead to a pollution
incident by ensuring the planning

of work and risk evaluation.

SCNL personnel receive regular
instructions, training and suitable
equipment to face such incidents.
Each project has developed a list
of possible spill occurrence areas,
such as fuel storage and refuelling
areas, condemned/waste oil
storage areas, workshop areas, etc.
Spill drills are carried out in SCNL
in order to test the reaction and
response of the work team in case
of spills and to evaluate workforce
awareness.

We have a very important tradition in the field of Oil Spill Response and we have been involved in different and
significant experiences such as the deepwater oil recovery loss from the Prestige oil tanker in Spain in 2004.

The continuous development of innovative methodologies and solutions for ‘oil spill response preparedness’ has
recently resulted in the acquisition of a major project (‘Subsea Well Response Project’ - SWRP) for a consortium of

most of the major oil companies, aimed at developing solutions
to respond quickly and efficiently to future subsea well-control
incidents. In this respect, SWRP has built the Offset Installation
Equipment (OIE), anovel tool designed to install a capping stack
on a blowout well allowing to lay short-term remediation of
environmental disasters like that of Deepwater Horizon platform.
The system was tested in the Adriatic Sea, commissioned and
delivered to the client and officially inaugurated in March 2018.

Other innovative approaches are under development in the field

of ‘oil spill monitoring & intervention’, such as the Early Warning
Integrated System (EWIS) and anew concept of intervention tool

for cleaning oil spills.

 

The EWIS will be an innovative data collection and decisional support platform for a very early and effective response to
oil spills. It is well known that the best way to minimise environmental damage in the event of an incident is to take proper
action in the shortest possible time. EWIS will collect, integrate and process data from different sources (satellite, aerial,
radars, fixed observational structures, etc.) related to the detection, movement and degradation of oil slicks. All data will
be processed and displayed in GIS configuration map screens ready for users to define the best oil recovery strategies.
