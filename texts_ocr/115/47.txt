BUSINESS ETHICS AS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE OPTION

Saipem undertakes to maintain and strengthen its corporate
governance system in line with international best practice
standards that can withstand both the complex situations

in which Saipem operates and the challenges it faces for
sustainable development. It is the duty of all Saipem people
to comply with laws, regulations, statutory provisions,

and self-regulatory codes and to embody ethical integrity
and fairness. The company strives with alacrity and
determination to ensure that these principles and values
characterise the conduct of the entire organisation.

FIGHTING CORRUPTION

As amultinational organisation, that conducts business in
over 60 countries and jurisdictions around the world, Saipem
and its personnel are subject to the laws of these countries,
including any law that ratifies international conventions, and
prohibits the corruption of Public Officials and private parties.
Furthermore, since Saipem SpA has its headquarters in Italy,
both the Company and its personnel are subject to Italian

law and, in particular, to the provisions of Legislative Decree
No. 231/2001 and subsequent amendments. This Decree
regulates the administrative liability of legal entities deriving
from offences, such as internal and international bribery,
committed by their directors, employees or associates, in
Italy or abroad, in the interest or to the advantage of said

legal entities. Model 231 is an instrument aimed at preventing
the offences specified by Legislative Decree No. 231/2001,
adopted for the first time in 2004. The latest update of Model
231 was approved by the Board of Directors on January

15, 2018 following a general review of Model 231 and arisk
assessment of all crimes contemplated under Legislative
Decree No. 231/2001 launched by the CEO on July 28, 2016.
The aim of the activity was to align the Model 231 to the latest
updates of the legislative framework and best practices and
to the relevant organisational changes which occurred, also
taking into account that in 2016 Saipem SpA ceased to be
under the control and co-ordination of Eni SpA.

As an official member of the UN Global Compact from whose
Ten Principles it draws inspiration, Saipem’s commitment
also falls within its adherence to the 10" principle, which
concerns the fight against corruption.

In accordance with the principle of ‘zero tolerance’ for
corruption expressed in the Code of Ethics, Saipem
implemented the Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme
to face other risks head-on which may be encountered by
the Company in its business activities. The programme

is a detailed system of rules and controls to prevent
corruption-related crimes, characterised by its dynamism
and constant attention to evolving national and international
legislation and best practices.

Saipem's Compliance Programme was introduced in
accordance with applicable anti-corruption provisions in
force and with international conventions (including the United
Nations Convention Against Corruption, the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention on
Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International
Business Transactions, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices

 

46

Actand Italian Legislative Decree No. 231 of June 8, 2001).
Subsequently, Saipem updated this Compliance Programme
by approving the ‘Anti-Corruption’ Management System
Guideline (MSG), with the objective of prohibiting any form of
active or passive bribery involving not only Public Officials
but also private parties.

As part of the continuous improvement of the Anti-Corruption
Compliance Programme, the ‘Anti-Corruption’ MSG, which
must be fully applied and complied with, was updated in

June 2015 on the basis of experience gained by Saipem over
the years and the need to represent an increasingly clear
framework of reference to identify areas at risk of corruption,
the tools the Company makes available to Saipem personnel
and the rules of conduct with which Saipem personnel

must comply in order to prevent and combat this risk.

The ‘Anti-Corruption’ MSG provides a systematic framework
for the long-established Anti-Corruption Regulations that
Saipem has designed and implemented over time and is
reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of Saipem
SpA. Its adoption and enforcement is mandatory for Saipem
SpA and all its subsidiaries.

Furthermore in 2018, Saipem was among the first Italian
companies to achieve the international certificate ISO
37001:2016 ‘Anti-corruption management systems’.

This certification, awarded by an independent accredited
body, identifies a management standard that helps
organisations in the fight against corruption, establishing a
culture of integrity, transparency and compliance.

The certification process, which included an audit phase that
began in January 2018 and ended in April 2018, took into
consideration such factors as the organisational structure,
local presence, processes and services.

‘Loyalty, fairness, transparency, efficiency, openness to
the market and respect for human rights are the guiding
principles of our Code of Ethics. This certification
represents a fundamental step to make our integrated
management system even more efficient’.

Stefano Cao, Saipem CEO
‘In Saipem we found a solid and extensive
anti-corruption management system based on
documented regulations with numerous process
descriptions in which the anti-corruption safeguards
are included in appropriate phases, where there is
widespread knowledge of the corruptive risks in each
role and of the prevention measures that must be
adopted and a systematic application of procedures’.
