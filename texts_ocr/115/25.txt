COMMITTED TO FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE

Although the link between climate-related indicators

and financial impacts is complex, climate-related risks

and opportunities undoubtedly affect the future strategy
and perspectives of an international and multi-business
technological solutions provider like Saipem.

In fact, Saipem can play an important role in helping and
supporting its clients meeting the needs of a fast changing
world.

Following the recommendations of the Task force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we have now
published our first disclosure on the topic ‘Tackling Climate
Change’, approved by Saipem BoD on January 15, 2019.
The document proves our commitment to providing effective
disclosure to our stakeholders on the issues that could
influence company operations and to demonstrating how we
are equipped to run our business in the long-term.

We analyse and monitor the potential implications of climate
change on our business and operations, and any other
issues in the medium/long-term, and have integrated this
consideration in the Company's strategic plans.

CLIMATE STRATEGY

In Saipem, the assessment of the long-term drivers of the
industry is based on the analysis of different climate-related
scenarios, prepared on the basis of a series of input and
analysis carried out internally and externally in order to pick
up on the main drivers of the energy industry, as well as

the emerging trends on technologies, policies, legislation,
socio-political aspects, etc.

The scenario analysis is applied to the entire Company,
covering the macro and energy trends up to 2050 that

have an impact on the main drivers of Saipem’s business.
These scenarios are updated at least annually and the results
are presented to the Board of Directors and to the Top
Management.

Scenario analysis is one of the elements considered by the
divisions for preparation of the Strategic Plan.

THE TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES AND THEIR IMPACT
In June 2017, the Task force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) published recommendations for
effective disclosure of climate-related financial risks.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) established the

Task Force in December 2015 to develop a set of
voluntary, consistent disclosure recommendations

for use by companies in providing information to
investors, lenders and insurance underwriters about
their climate-related financial risks. The 32 industry
members of the Task Force, drawn from a wide range of
industries and countries, finalised the recommendations
after extensive public engagement and consultation.
The TCFD developed four recommendations on
climate-related financial disclosures that are applicable
to organisations across sectors and jurisdictions.
Following its Action Plan on Financing Sustainable
Growth released in March 2018, the Technical Expert
Group on Sustainable Finance (a technical working
group set up by the European Commission) has recently
published its Report ‘Climate-related Disclosures’.

The report compares the TCFD's recommended
disclosures to the elements of the Directive 2014/95/EU
highlighting the common points. The report proposes
climate-related disclosures, differentiated based on

the companies’ exposure to climate change, to assist
the European Commission in its revision of the current
Non-Binding Guidelines of the Directive 2014/95/EU.

We plan to gradually reduce our dependence on the

fossil fuels business by extending the offer to our clients

in less climate-impacting fields, investing in renewable
technologies, and by developing more sustainable fossil
fuels uses and diversifying our activities. We are making
significant efforts to improve the efficiency of our assets and
operations to reduce GHG emissions.
