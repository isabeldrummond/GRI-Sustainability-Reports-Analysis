SAFETY FOR OUR ASSETS

Safe operations require safe tools and a safe working
technique. The role of asset integrity management becomes
more and more crucial based on the evolution of the energy
industry: more challenging operations means being exposed
to complexities in even more hazardous and extreme
conditions.

Safety for our operations refers to the prevention

and control of events with low frequency and

high/severe consequences to people, the
environment, assets or project performance.

The risk of asset failures leading to Major Accident Events
(MAE), with consequences on Saipem’s reputation and
enterprise value, has to be managed, controlled and
minimised: the HSE Case helps because it is a process,
which identifies risks relevant to the activities carried out
onboard and maps all key elements to ensure their control.
It is traditionally developed for the offshore production and
drilling units and in the last few years has been extended to
the offshore construction fleet.

For the latter, anumber of MAE scenarios are identified as
credible escalations from initiating events that may occur
during, for example, the installation of a platform or during
pipe-laying operations.

The Saipem Offshore Construction Vessel Integrity
Management Model pursues the effective management of
Saipem assets, from the design of vessel upgrades and new
equipment to operation and maintenance, throughout the
whole life cycle of the asset. The integrity model identifies
the safety case as the key process to analyse MAE scenarios
and to identify barriers that shall be put in place to prevent
and control escalation to major events.

In previous years, due to the dynamic nature of the offshore
construction business, a new guideline to an ‘upgraded’
version of the Vessel safety case (aligned with Asset Integrity
Best Practices released by OGP) was developed and
launched. In 2018, the update of Saipem Vessel safety case
continued, involving two additional vessels. Since Saipem
fleet can be divided into clusters of vessels with similar
features and MAE scenarios, a similar set of barriers (i.e.
similar set of safety critical equipment, competences and
procedures) was identified and standard libraries of safety
critical elements will be developed in 2019. This will ease and
speed up the compilation of new Vessel safety cases and
ensure a consistent approach throughout the fleet.

To evaluate asset integrity performance against stated goals,
monitoring and reporting are key factors. For this reason a
set of common asset integrity KPIs were selected. In this
framework and with a specific focus on floaters operations,
in 2019 the first report with the results of this activity in the
Onshore division will be issued.

COMPETENCE AS A MAIN POINT
FOR SAFE OPERATIONS

The Competence Assurance & Assessment (CA&A)
programme was launched at the Drilling projects in Saudi
Arabian Saipem (SAS) Ltd in 2016, and then extended to
offshore and onshore FPSO projects. The goalis to improve
any identified weakness, enhance personnel development
paths, as well as contribute to the development of the
competence of local personnel. In 2018, the campaign

also involved all personnel working in onshore projects

as scaffolding supervisors was performed to ensure their
high level of competence. This campaign involved both
Saipem and subcontractor personnel and was carried out in
Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Nigeria.

For example, the FPSO Cidade de Vitoria benefited from the
project for different reasons: the application of the technical
evaluations of the offshore group, the participation of CA&A
trained vessel management teams exposing their positive
experience and development, and for the performance

of competence assessments. This first phase identified
important development opportunities for office personnel,
while the second phase was extended to personnel
on-board the FPSO.
Another initiative in this framework is the Barrier Ownership
Cards Programme, planned and arranged on Scarabeo 8

to establish and highlight which tasks are safety critical and
the relevant Barrier Functions (BF) to be implemented and
followed-up onboard. Therefore, the programme aimed to
increase the awareness of each individual so as to clarify the
actions to prevent undesired incidents and/or minimise the
consequences of such incidents. The programme consisted
in sharing and providing a specific ‘Barrier ownership card’
for each person in charge of an action. The card contains all
information and the actions needed to properly prevent and
respond to an emergency. Furthermore, a dedicated manual
was issued to keep focusing on this critical topic and on this
initiative.
