working all over the world, knowledge of digital tools and

big data are among the key factors. For this reason and in
addition to traditional training courses and digital learning,
we have also experimented with forms of reverse mentoring
(SEED - Skill Exchange from Expert and Digital people),
supporting junior and senior resources for mutual learning on
different technical fields. This initiative serves the purpose

of incentivising the exchange of digital, technical, managerial
and behavioural skills between junior and senior resources in
our organisation.

Senior and junior resources involved

 

At the same time, we are strongly committed to the
development and employment of local people.

Providing job opportunities, transferring know-how and
capabilities contributes to creating value in the medium-long
term.

One story comes from Saipem Romania with its headquarters
in Bucharest and an important Technology Centre in Ploiesti.
To have a reliable source of potential manpower, over the last
two years collaboration programmes with local universities,
and specifically with UPG - Oil & Gas University from Ploiesti,
were developed. Each semester a delegation from Saipem
Romania visits the students, who gain precious information
on howan international structured organisation operates

and on potential job opportunities within Saipem. Saipem,

on the other hand, gains new feedback regarding what new
generations expect from ajob assignment and how to better
drive the right messages and topics to them.

In the framework of this partnership, a delegation of

the BoD and 20 students of the UPG were invited to the
technology centre to experience an operational reality,
starting from a full safety induction, continuing with a visit
of a production area where they had the possibility to see

our operations with their own eyes. Since we have started
such collaboration with the University of Ploiesti, around 30
young graduates have been interviewed and around one
third of them have been hired and are currently working at
Saipem Romania.

Another story comes from the experience of five Nigerian
engineers spending three months at Saipem headquarters
in the framework of the NLNG Train 7 Feed Project for
technological transfer.

 

Our three months stay (September to November) in
Milan was an interesting experience. We gained more
knowledge and the exposure improved our scope of
understanding and involvement in the project, leading to
the company's achievement of its goals for technological
transfer in accordance with the Nigerian content act.
We also had amemorable human experience and we
earnestly look forward to another opportunity to explore
such rare opportunities again.

 

Astable presence in more than 60 countries means to provide
locals with job opportunities but, sometimes, also

facing critical business situations. In this second case,
creating value can occur simply by solving these situations
giving new opportunities to local employees. One example
comes from Indonesia where in 2018 a mobilisation process
at the Karimun yard was managed. During 2018, the activity

in Karimun yard was limited to the Tangguh Expansion project
and the low workload resulted in a demobilisation process.
Most of the remaining manpower was local; those who
demobilised from Karimun yard had the opportunity to work
for other Saipem projects, either in Indonesia or worldwide:
25% of the total number of personnel demobilised in 2018
were re-hired by PT Saipem Indonesia for Onshore Tangguh
Project; and welders, welding foremen, piping supervisors and
wrappers were hired for Barzan Project in Qatar.

In terms of talent attraction, we
concentrate efforts on initiatives
with universities and technical high
schools. In this framework, there are
some initiatives worth mentioning.
The ‘Programma Sinergia’ is
based on acollaboration with
technical high schools to create
greater alignment and cooperation
between technical knowledge

and its use in Saipem's business.
This Italian programme includes
school training programmes,
summer camp (theoretical and
practical courses) and short
internships. Below are two

examples of the implementation of
the programme.

Thanks to our strong presence in
the Arbatax fabrication yard area,
an agreement with two technical
and professional institutes in Tortoli
was reached: teachers from Saipem
delivered classroom training on
technical matters while students
were involvedin an on-the-job
training programme in the yard.

Students involved

The drilling community within
Saipem has worked ona growth
plan for the business that has

an optimistic outlook on the
reference markets. The Onshore
and Offshore Drilling divisions have
thus invested in the most important
asset they have - skills — ‘adopting’
the mechanical studies class at
Istituto Superiore G. Marconi in
Piacenza creating a three-year
work-study programme focussed
on drilling. ‘Teachers’ from Saipem
and teachers from the school work
together to develop industry skills
including theory, project work,
