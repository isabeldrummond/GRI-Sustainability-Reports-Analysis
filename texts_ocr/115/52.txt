and complete a questionnaire, allowing for an evaluation of

the level of safety awareness and the impact on pipe handling

performance throughout the project life cycle.

Aware that positive safety performance can be achieved

through a joint effort, in the framework of the Zhor

Optimised Ramp-Up project, Saipem involved its

subcontractors and vendors in the following HSE initiatives:

вл The HSE Engagement Workshop - We Want Zero fatal

accidents was organised to share the main project
criticalities and develop an action programme witha Series
of HSE initiatives to be implemented.

The Leadership in Health and Safety - Leading

Behaviours programme focused on the implementation

of six tool box talks each one of them corresponding to a

Leading Behaviour (Start, Recognise, Intervene, Challenge,

Change, final).

The Tool Box Talk Goes Live, a communication initiative

that reproduces a real yard activity situation through HSE

incident re-enactment, and if necessary, the intervention
on aninjured person.

* Theoretical and practical training sessions were organised
to increase safety and environmental awareness on topics
suchas Lifting operations, Scaffolding, Spill prevention
and response, etc.

 

 

Cooperation and engagement in HSE-related issues contribute
to fostering the win-win strategy Saipem has established with
its subcontractors. Over the past few years, HSE forums have
been delivered to subcontractors in different countries to help
improve their knowledge and awareness in the field.

Itis in this framework that Saipem organised its events in
Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Guyana.

In Saudi Arabia, the HSE Forum for subcontractors took
place in Dammam also in 2018, enforcing the development
plan in technical skills and competences. The Forum was
attended by the CEOs of all Saipem legal entities operating
in onshore businesses in the country, together with the
representatives of the most important construction
companies operating in the field.

In Nigeria, Saipem Contracting Nigeria Ltd (SCNL) hosted
the 9" edition of the HSE Subcontractor Forum, with the
objective to share relevant HSE information with vendors
and subcontractors, to discuss the annual SCNL HSE
performance results, to highlight areas of HSE concerns and

the actions to be addressed; a special session was dedicated

For the Liza Project, Saipem Guyana Branch launched

principles and values and promoting safety initiatives and
campaigns for the entire duration of the project.

COMMITMENT TO GUARANTEE DECENT WORK
ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN

Continuing in the vein of the training programme for Saipem
employees carried out on Human Rights and the supply
chain (2016-2017), in 2018 Saipem further disseminated the
initiative with an e-learning campaign to reach the entire
population of the Post Order Function in all working sites
worldwide.

After an introduction on human and labour rights aspects
(discrimination, forced/compulsory labour, child labour,
remuneration, working hours, disciplinary practices, freedom
of association/collective bargaining and protection of health
and safety), the e-learning training aims to instruct the
employees, who have a direct interaction with suppliers, on
the importance of reporting serious situations that may be
noticed while visiting vendor sites.
