PROTECTING AND PROMOTING HUMAN
AND LABOUR RIGHTS

 

oe

Respect for Human Rights is a fundamental value
of Saipem which considers them to be inalienable,
essential and the basis for establishing a society
founded on the principles of equality, solidarity,
repudiation of war, the protection of civil, political, social,
economic and cultural rights and the acknowledgement
of so-called third generation rights (the right of
self-determination, the right to peace, the right to
development and protection of the environment).
Saipem operates within the reference framework of the
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
the Fundamental Conventions of the ILO — International
Labour Organization — and the OECD Guidelines on
Multinational Enterprises.

Saipem Human Rights Policy 99

 

Saipem’s commitment to respecting and promoting
internationally recognised human rights encompasses
different spheres of our business: our people, our supply
chain, the local communities in which we operate, and all
security aspects. Proof of this dedication is our acceptance
into Global Compact since 2016 and the ongoing and
transparent dialogue and engagement on human and labour
rights topics with all our stakeholders.

An example of initiatives addressed to Saipem people is the
comprehensive training on human and labour rights (HLR)
delivered to Managing Directors, Branch Managers, Human
and Industrial Relations Managers operating worldwide.
Started in 2017, the programme was expanded in 2018
covering 85% of the identified resources. The training
covered aspects related to international regulations
protecting human rights, as well as possible risks related to
the kind of activities in which Saipem engages. Moreover,

in addition to offering a detailed review of Saipem's policies
and regulations with reference to HLR, the training also
focused on the awareness of the degree in which the rights
protected under the ILO core conventions were reflected in
the legislation of the countries where we operate.

Global Petroprojects Services (GPS AG) is a subsidiary of
the Saipem Group, established in Switzerland in 1964. It is
licensed for international recruitment and manpower supply
since 1994 and as Seafarer's Recruitment and Placement
Services agent in compliance with the ILO MLC 2006 since
2013.

GPS AG is indeed a human resources centre of excellence,
which provides a complex spectrum of HR related

services to Saipem worldwide, in addition to several

other auxiliary services (monitoring of training needs

and training arrangements, data inputting, the support

for bid estimations, etc.). It operates combining business
peculiarities with the evolution of the market.

For certain complex contexts, GPS AG is supported by local
agencies to satisfy legal obligations connected mainly with
domestic legislation. In the framework of its human and
labour rights commitment, Saipem has a rigorous process
in place for selecting workforce suppliers and a structured
engagement to promote fruitful cooperation. GPS AG
constantly monitors, directly and indirectly, how employment
agencies manage recruitment and administration practices
either through audits during the validation of a purchase
document and/or assessments prior to the service
provisions at the vendor's premises or by phone interviews
with international personnel to get their own perceptions.
Said feedback collected during phone conversations

in English can confirm that employment agencies meet
Saipem’s requirements.

In 2018, GPS AG launched a customised eLearning course
for international workers to assess their perception of topics
such as fighting corruption, social responsibility, integrity,
ethical supply chain, health and safety, etc. Of course, this
is just one among a variety of tools to assess — for instance
—if manpower agencies do not require payment of any
placement fees or other compensation to access Saipem
employment proposals.

Finally, GPS AG's aim is to maintain a stable channel of
communications with Subcontractors and International
Employees to promote more and more the adoption of good
practices in the area of overseas recruitment and enforce a
fair and transparent recruitment process.
