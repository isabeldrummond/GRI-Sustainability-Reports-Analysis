INEFOP is the National Institute of Employment and Vocational training in Angola; it provides training
and also job guidance and certification of competencies. Saipem-Petromar is very concerned about
the training of the young generation in Angola, so in 2018 and in partnership with INEFOP, we welcomed
a group of 90 young students for a 3-month technical internship at Ambriz yard to increase their
employability by developing professional skills. The students were mentored by Saipem-Petromar
supervisors in several disciplines like piping and welding during their internship.

With the sponsorship of Ersai (Saipem's local company

in Kazakhstan), the Nurlan Kapparov Foudation
implemented a project to provide charitable assistance

to gifted children, children from low-income families, and
children with disabilities living in rural areas of the country.
The foundation proposed a new approach to education,
creating a programme focused on providing quality
mathematics education in rural areas, so that rural children
can have equal opportunities for admission to prestigious
universities. Furthermore, a rehabilitation centre for
disabled children was opened and the construction

began of a dormitory for teachers of the regional physical
and mathematical school for gifted children in South
Kazakhstan.

del Gaviotin Chico aims to
contribute to the conservation

and protection of a birdin danger

of extinction, the Little Tern
(Sternula lorata), generating highly
qualified strategies and procedures
compatible with the industrial
development of the Mejillones
commune. As a member of the
foundation and being involvedin the
construction of the water pipeline

in Chile crossing through the area

in which the bird nests, Saipem

is committed to fully supporting
foundation activities. Among other
things, the foundation deals with
dissemination of information for the
protection of the Little Tern. It also
controls access and circulation by
means of a perimeter fence/physical
protection of the work fronts located
in the Gaviotin Chico nesting areas,
disposal of nets and relocation

of traps on work front structures

in nesting areas of the Little

Tern. There is an environmental
supervisor to ensure compliance
with these measures.
