Technology and Innovation Days
Itis worth mentioning the event
‘Tech Days’ held on board of
Saipem 7000 at Cartagena,
where the company presented to
key players of the offshore wind
business and to representatives of
media the ongoing technological
and innovation efforts to sustain
the increasing role of Saipem

in the renewable sector, within
the framework of a sustainable
business model

Another ‘Technology and
Innovation Day’ was held in
Algiers to celebrate the 50 years
of Saipem’s presence in the
North African country, where the
company's divisions presented
Saipem's capabilities as ‘global
solution provider’, driven by

a continuous technological
development, to Sonatrach

Innovation Factory
Saipem Innovation Factory
is our incubator for ideas and
a fast-prototyping lab that
aims to tackle problems with
across-functional view, and
to develop groundbreaking

responses and concrete solutions
to the sector's challenges, giving at
the same time an impulse for digital
innovation

The most promising ideas and
solutions generated by the working
team evolve into prototypes
following a ‘scale fast’ basis, thus
seeking to assess their effective
potential through an efficient
investment in time and resources.
During the Proof of Concept (PoC)
phase, the support offered by
discipline specialists is fundamental
in order to integrate the available
skills in the groups to their

specific know-how. The concepts
considered valid are then scaled-up
If the prototype does not reach the
desired outcomes, the experience
gained is capitalised, and the

team is ready to move on to anew
challenge. Constant collaboration
with internal and external
stakeholders (universities, R&D
centres, start-ups, traditional and
non-traditional partners) is a key
pillar.

Between 2016 and 2018, the
innovative thinkers focused on

challenges such as: xD Information
Model, Digital Site, Drilling

Virtual Training, Market Analysis

& Supply Chain, Offshore Fleet
Improvements, Virtual & Mixed
Reality Site Visit, Workshop
Automation, Augmented support
to operations, and Saipem Fleet
Integrated Maintenance

Proof of Concept ongoing
