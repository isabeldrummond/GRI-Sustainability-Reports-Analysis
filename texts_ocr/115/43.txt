— OUR COMPETENCIES FOR CIRCULARITY

For Saipem ‘to innovate’ also means to renew itself, to
enhance competencies within different industries and
to create value while contributing to the circularity of the
business.

In this framework decommissioning, dismantling oil plants
and infrastructure in a sustainable way, is one example.
Two stories come from the Mediterranean Sea and the
North Sea.

Saipem 7000 was the protagonist of the
decommissioning campaign of the Miller platform in the
North Sea, whose final phase was executed between
January 2017 and July 2018. Twelve topside modules and
the jacket were removed and transported to a disposal
yard by the S7000 heavy lift vessel.

Between 2014 and 2017 Saipem, together with San
Giorgio del Porto, succeeded in one of the most important
green ship recycling projects in Europe: the dismantling of
the Costa Concordia. The ship recycling plan was divided
into four phases: wreck delivery and lightening, transfer
and dismantling, activities for the removal of ‘sponsons’,
final dismantling.

power system for peak shaving and ‘spinning reserve’.
Additionally, new technology makes it possible to store and
use regenerated power from the derrick hoisting systems,
either as capacitors (super-caps/ultra-caps), fly-wheel
systems, batteries and pressure vessels. By implementing
this technology it is possible to reduce power demand from
the drilling systems significantly.

The implementation of ESS in the power generation
facilitates, together with closed bus-tie operation, significant
reduction of number of generators running, more efficiency,

fuel consumption, emissions and maintenance reduction.
The ‘ECO’ branding also means that other features were
implemented in the design to reduce the environmental
footprint, such as waste heat recovery, exhaust gas
cleaning (Tier Ill), ballast water treatment, slop water
treatment.

INNOVATION INITIATIVES

Innovation Trophy

Since 2003, with the institution

of the Innovation Trophy, Saipem
has sought to reward employees
who bring their innovative spirit,
advantages and concrete results

to the company. Since its inception
(having now reached the 14" edition),
attention has been mostly directed
towards technology development
and afew employees have laid out
Saipem’s most important successes
inthe recent past.

In recent years, it has been decided
to reward process innovations, also in
line with the new innovation strategy.
Since 2015, anew special

award has also been introduced
for technology innovation to
acknowledge the sustainability
value of our operations.

In 2018, the sustainability award
went to Stability Frame For

Fully Assembled Wind Turbine
Generator Installation, a stability
frame system for the installation of
high-performance offshore wind
generators, allowing us to enter

the wind market, in particular the
floating offshore wind sector, in
very challenging environments with
medium-deep seabeds.
