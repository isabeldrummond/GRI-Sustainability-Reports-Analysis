Our Stakeholders and material topics

Identification of relevant topics

First, a group of potentially relevant aspects for the company and its stakeholders were
identified. The identification included the analysis of internal documentation (code

of ethics, financial statements and explanatory notes, institutional website, etc.) and
external documentation (sector studies and publications). In addition, we performed a
benchmarking analysis of industry best practices at national and international levels.

Evaluation of topics relevant for the Group

In order to prioritize the relevant sustainability aspects, we organized a workshop
with the participation of representatives of Corporate Management, including the
Shareholders.

During the workshop, the representatives of each area expressed their point of view
regarding relevant issues for the company.

Evaluation of topics relevant for the Group’s stakeholders

The materiality analysis process involved almost 900 stakeholders, divided into

7 categories: employees, clients, suppliers, banks, insurance, trade associations,
universities and authorities.

Stakeholders were requested to evaluate material issues through an online
questionnaire, asking them to assess relevance, ona scale from 1 to 5, regarding issues
identified as materials. The questionnaire achieved an excellent overall response rate
of 64%, with a remarkable 73% of the suppliers, 63% of the employees and 62%
of the clients. In addition, all universities as well as 2 out of 3 trade associations and
banks/insurances responded to the materiality analysis questionnaire.

Materiality matrix and definition of the list of
material topics

Creating the materiality matrix is the fourth step taken by the Group to define its
material topics. The matrix is the result of the combination of the workshop and the
stakeholder questionnaire analysis. Among the topics evaluated, only those with the
highest social and environmental impact as well as those with the highest relevance for
stakeholders were considered essential for the Sustainability Report. In order to select,
a materiality threshold of 4 (on a scale from 1 to 5) was chosen.
