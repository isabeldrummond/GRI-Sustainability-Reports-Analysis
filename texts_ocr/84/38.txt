Logistics and
packaging

The environmental impact of
our Group extends beyond our
manufacturing process to the
entire activity of the Company.
We source our raw materials
and sell our products all over
the world: In addition, most

of our production is delivered
packaged in bags, drums, and
IBC’s.

An innovative approach to
logistics and to packaging is
important. A careful analysis
of the logistics flow shows that
we favour intermodal transport
via railway or sea, compared to
standard road transportation.
For packaging, we endeavour
to recycle used containers and
reutilize them several times in
order to save significant amounts
of material. What’s more, we
utilize containers partly made
with recycled materials.

We are actively pursuing the
objective of reducing the
environmental impact of our
containers, by reducing their
number.

Logistics

Since mid-2018, Lamberti

SpA started a project aimed at
promoting intermodal transport
instead of road transport in order
© decrease the environmental
impact of its transport. The
project centered on the Italy

— Spain route, frequently used

or shipments between group’s
companies and generally carried
out only by road.

Lamberti is gradually moving
ransport from road to
intermodal, utilizing sea transport
between Savona and Barcelona.
This activity led toa 46.6%
reduction in CO,e emission on
hat route in 2019, corresponding
0 a total saving of 138 tons of
CO,e emissions.

Packaging

Many of our packaging materials
(IBC, drums and cans) are

made of plastic material. In

2016, we started to gradually
introduce reutilization of
packaging in order to reduce
plastic consumption. In 2019,
we launched a more aggressive
project, in line with the Green
Deal targets set by European
Union, which includes:

- Washing and Recycling of used
IBC’s, including those used by
our customers;

- Use of lighter JCR (JerryCans);
- Use of drums/IBC partially
made with recycled material.
