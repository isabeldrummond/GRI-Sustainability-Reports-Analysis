People and social responsibility
Employees welfare and well-being

In 2019 our Group had one

case of development of work-
related ill health, which occurred
in one of our American plants.
The illness was classified as
musculoskeletal caused mainly
by lifting and moving products in
the warehouse. To eliminate such
incidents, all employees were
retrained on body mechanics
and lifting principles. In addition,
we purchased new equipment
to help move loads, while
employees are not permitted

to lift more than 50 pounds
(approx. 23 kg) by hands.

Health Services

In Italy, the National Health
System (NHS) is accessible
to everyone regardless the
economic and social conditions

and, therefore, is accessible to
all our employees. Our Group
also offers further Occupational
Health Services such as work
permits for medical visits,

an infirmary in many plants,
participation of the doctor
responsible for H&S in the

preparation of the risk evaluation,

welfare programs and presence
of First Aid Operators trained
according to regulations.

Moreover, during medical
checks we offer the possibility
of integrating clinical tests with
voluntary analysis for the control
of other health conditions not
linked to our employees’ work
(eg. triglycerides, cholesterol).

Finally, close to the winter period,

we promote a free voluntary flu
vaccination campaign.

Workplace gender
equality

Within the ESG (Environment,
Social and Governance)
principles of sustainability,
although the environmental
portion has generally attracted
the most attention within the
chemical industry, social aspects
are equally important for us,
particularly concerning gender
equality and diversity.

In 2019 we launched a workplace gender equality

initiative that involves women working across
various functions of our organization. Through the
combination of cognitive and physical activities for
well being, the aim was to increase and enhance
resilience as well as “ean-do’ attitude. The initiative
has been extremely positive and impactful as
emphasized by four of our employees who
participated in the initiative.
