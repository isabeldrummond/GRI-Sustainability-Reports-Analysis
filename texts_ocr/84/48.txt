Employees benefits

We provide a wide variety of
benefits to our employees

that includes insurance for
accidents during and beyond
working hours as well as medical
coverage. For instance, every
year we offer the option of

free flu vaccination to many
employees Lamberti plans to
expand this option in the coming
years. Over time, we have also set

up a well-structured corporate
welfare system that provides
economic and social benefits
throughout our organization.
We make sure to offer additional
health insurance for managers
and employees: the first is
mostly paid by our Group, while
the second is partially paid.
Moreover, we offer special
rates with medical centers and

laboratories, as well as with
gyms, physiotherapy studios and
wellness centers.

We also care for the families of
our employees; each year we
offer the possibility of parental
leave to both our female and
male employees. 43 employees
took parental leave in 2019, up
from 33 employees in 2018.
