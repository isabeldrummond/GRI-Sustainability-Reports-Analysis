About Lamberti
Letter to the Stakeholders

We are a global
scientific company.

We are a global company producing chemical specialties.
The interaction of multiple scientific frameworks is our specific wealth.

Our experience stems from over a century of history (Lamberti was founded in 1911). From the initial
affiliation to the textile industry, we have learned the value of being part of structured ecosystems. Over
time, we have invested in industrial plants and laboratories in diverse locations becoming active part

of advanced districts specialized in textiles, leather, ceramics, petroleum and agriculture. The cultural

environments of those productive eco-systems have benefited the growth of our scientific knowledge as

well as our proficiency cluster.

 

We have fostered a network of
relationships, a rich wellspring
of experience that gives value
to our people providing training
practices and structures,
continuous learning and
innovation in methods.

Our company organization has
been designed as a systemic
pattern that links knowledge,
experience and research with
continuity in manufacturing and
new values in the markets.

We combine advanced
technologies and tailor-made
approaches, methods and
systems. When knowledge
opens new paths and engages an
array of different competences,
the connection activates
sustainable new warps and
wefts among nature, people and
society.

We design and develop
processes while ensuring human
safety and protection of the
communities: our technologies
generate value, while minimizing
the impact on the environment
We supply worldwide industries
with customized chemical
