A key feature of our business is
that a significant part of the water
we withdraw is consumed, and
not discharged; in fact, in both
2019 and 2018 we saw that over
48% of the water withdrawn was
consumed.

We constantly monitor our water
discharges and periodic checks
are carried out as good company
practice. Water is discharged
mainly to Third-party plants (86%
of total discharges for 2019) while
only a limited part is discharged
directly in the environment.

Esaflor Zero-X: Better Performance
and Lower Water Consumption

Zero-X technology is a newly
patented, sustainable process
to obtain a cosmetic cationic
guar, used as an ingredient in
shampoo formulations.

The product uses a sustainable
and 100% renewable raw
material: Guar, cultivated mainly
in India and Pakistan.

Lamberti has developed anew
generation process, providing
a higher yield and a significant
reduction of waste, production
cycle time and energy
consumption.

The new process provides a
higher yield and reduces the
water consumed in the standard
purification process by over 90%.
Shorter processing times and
reduced water presence also
lowers the energy consumed

to produce Esaflor Zero-X,
resulting in a range of truly
environmentally-friendly
products
