How we source energy is a key
issue for our Group.
Cogeneration (CHP), which
produces electricity and thermal
energy (e.g. steam and hot water)
at the same time, is the most
efficient process.

Our three major Italian
manufacturing plants have their
own cogeneration plants fora
total installed capacity of 5 MW,
equal to a self-production of
around 50,000 GJ per year. This
means that they produce 86% of
their electricity requirement.

The conscientious use of
materials is another feature
that shows our commitment to

operating a responsible business.

We are working to reduce the
environmental impact of the

raw material consumption by
investing in low-impact, recycled
or recyclable materials and
designing anew generation

of processes. The use of raw
materials fell from about 195,462
tons in 2018 to about 190,207
tons in 2019.

WATER WITHDRAWAL (Megaliters)

Finally, water is more precious
than gold, especially potable
water -aresource already
scarce in many areas of the
world - therefore, it is our duty to
optimize its use.

We use water coming from deep
wells or aqueducts. We do not
use water from rivers, lakes or
seas. We limit our use in water-
stressed areas. We believe in an
efficient use of resources, which
involves reducing withdrawals to
aminimum, and optimizing the
use of water in our factories.

In 2019 we withdrew 867 ML of
water worldwide and we aim to
reduce our water consumption
by 15% within 2023.
