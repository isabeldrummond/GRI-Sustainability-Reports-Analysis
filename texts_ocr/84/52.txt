People and social responsibility
Relations with local communities

Open Plants (Fabbriche
Aperte)

We have always been aware of
the relevance that our presence
has for the communities living
close to our main plants. In
addition to a mutually respectful
relationship, we recognize the
importance of bringing local
communities closer to our entity
as well as to our daily activities.

“Fabbriche Aperte” is an initiative
that currently takes place in

Italy and Spain and involves
primary schoolchildren. For

one entire day, they come to
visit, the production facilities
and laboratories, guided by our
employees. Our aim is to make
young generations aware of the
role of chemistry in their lives and
the society they live in.

Tree planting (Trees for the
future

In 2019 we contributed to make
our planet greener through two
global initiatives. Our Indian
affiliate (Lamberti Hydrocolloids
Pvt Ltd) promoted a community
tree planting initiative in
September through which

100 Neem trees were planted
close to our factory. Neem trees
are highly beneficial to the
environment because they have

102

aremarkable ability to withstand
heat as well as air and water
pollution.

At our Italian sites, we promoted
the planting of 1000 trees in
South America. This initiative
was enacted through a gift card
that each employee could use
to symbolically plant a tree.
After the initial planting, the
donor could trace the tree’s
growth and developmentover
the years. In this way, we created
our own forest thanks to the
cooperation and contribution of
our personnel.

   
 

 

Lamberti plans to

carry out extensive
reforestation of the area
adjacent to our Waste
Water Treatment plant
in Albizzate in 2022.

Initiatives and partnerships
with local entities

Since our founding we have
believed in creating a shared
heritage, supporting local
entities and institutions such as
schools, museums and hospitals.

In Albizzate, where our industrial
activity started, we actively
support the local authorities to
ensure the land maintains its
value. For instance, we recently
financed the construction of

a pedestrian and cycle path to
connect two different parts of
town.

We enjoy an excellen
relationship with local schools
and museums. We support them
by donating teaching materials
and in the promotion of their
exhibitions and activities.

 

In Brasil we plan to work

with a local NGO to support
professional development of
young people.

We have established a strong
and long lasting relationship with
the Italian Red Cross aimed at
improving the vital services they
provide to society.
