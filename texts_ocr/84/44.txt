Employees welfare

and well-being

Pushing boundaries to new
frontiers (Employees as

people)

Our primary duty to our
employees is to provide them
with a safe working environment.
Safety has always been at the
top of our agenda and we aim to
improve it constantly. In 2019, we
started to work on a behavioural
safety program with the goal

to raise the bar to a new idea of
protection.

We actively encourage people
to work together, which is also
one of our core values. Working
together in cross-functional
teams is mutually enriching and
allows us to leverage on our
different competencies, which
are key to our inspiration and
scientific innovation.

Working together, we bring out
the best in ourselves.

We are committed to promoting
a stimulating work environment
based on entrepreneurship

and autonomy, where people
see themselves in a continuous
process of transformation

and growth. A science-driven
approach, a can-do attitude,
teamwork and staunch
customer-focus make our
organization successful. We
work together to make complex
products that fit the world we live
in today as well as the future.

 

Our Program:

We have a strong program for
our employees’ safety, which

is our highest priority. We
constantly analyse and keep
track of the main potential risks
by drawing upon the latest
technologies. We also have
extensive, dedicated employee
training sessions on how to
behave in critical situations.
The development of a new digital
platform will make it possible to
share all safety knowledge and
best practices throughout the
organization. The project has
been launched this year and
will be completely on-line in
2021.

We carefully monitor our
operations and every effort is
put to minimize the number of
accidents. All employees receive
updated training and we are
implementing several Behaviour
Based Safety (BBS) Training
plans. Our target is to reduce our
present Frequency Index (N° LTA
10/ 1,000,000 worked hours)
from 6.12, recorded in 2019, to
3.90, which is the average of
Italian Companies following

Responsible Care Program (see
25° Rapporto Responsible Care,
issued by Federchimica).

Our Group entrusts workers with
tasks that take their skills and
health into account. In addition,
we make sure that only workers
who have received adequate
instruction and specific training
access the areas that expose
them to a serious, specific risk.
We promptly take measures to
control risk situations and require
workers, in the event of serious,
immediate and unavoidable
danger, to leave their workplace
or dangerous area. Moreover, in
our Safety, Health, Environmental
Protection and Quality Policy,
we highlight how workers shall
“assume respect for Safety,
Health and the Environment as
a guiding element in corporate
decision-making processes,
both in protecting workers

and respecting the needs of
surrounding communities.”

Our Code of Ethics also defines
the values and rules of conduct
for all workers The Code is
inspired by our values of fairness
and transparency.

Overall, 96% of our employees
are covered by an occupational
Health and Safety Management
System, in order to minimize

the risks of injury or illness that
an employees may encounter.
Specifically, 58% of the group
employees are covered by an
occupational health and safety
management system that has
been audited by an external
party, while a further 15% of the
employees are covered by a
similar system that has been
audited internally.
