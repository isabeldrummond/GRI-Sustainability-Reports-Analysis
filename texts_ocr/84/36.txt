Emission of greenhouse

gases

We are fully aware of the impact
that climate change may have
on our Group. For this reason,
we aim to contribute to amore
sustainable society. We also
acknowledge that both risks and
opportunities may arise from
the implementation of a more
sustainable approach to our
business. This awareness has
led us to design a new alliance
between industrial behavior and
the environment, thus fostering
respectful science and good
chemistry.

 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  

In terms of risks, climate change
leads to physical disruptions
due to severe weather events,
harming not only our Group, but
also our workforce. These events
include storms and hurricanes,
air and water pollution, fires, sea-
level rise, extreme temperatures
and variation in seasonality.

All these phenomena may
negatively affect our operations.
Furthermore, the transition to a
low carbon economy requires
stricter carbon legislation; not
being compliant with existing
and future regulations poses
aclear risk to the company’s
business.

In terms of opportunities,

in tackling issues related to
climate change, we plan to
implement or have already
applied numerous actions.

We believe that achieving a
positive environmental impact
should not be limited to our own
actions; our Group sees this as
an opportunity to generate a
comprehensive plan, so that also
critical stakeholder groups, such
as raw material suppliers can be
involved. Our sustainable plan is
composed of two phases:

- phase |: creation and
development of a dialogue
pertinent to type of stakeholder
- phase |: implementation

of the options regarding the
environmental impact of
operations, including availability
of key resources (depletion
issues)

Auditing the existing overall
energy sources within a given
period provides us with a

clear understanding of our
current emissions. This data
makes it possible to establish a
sustainable plan to increase the
percentage of renewable energy
sources utilized. We also intend
to implement additional activities
to improve water management
through specific data-driven
commitments. Our goal is to
source most raw materials from
environmentally sustainable
suppliers.

These efforts represent a

clear opportunity to tackle the
negative effects of climate
change and anticipate future
sustainability requirements.

In order to make this liability
transparent and pertinent to
our Group, it is essential for us
to share these initiatives with
our workforce and our other
stakeholders, regarding the
responsibilities related to the
Sustainable Development Goals
and our long-term objective to
fight climate change.
