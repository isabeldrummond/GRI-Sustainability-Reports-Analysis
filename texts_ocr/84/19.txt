Code of Ethics

The Board of Directors approved
the latest version of Lamberti’s
Code of Ethics on September
12,2019. The Code of Ethics
(hereinafter also referred to as
“Code”) provides a summary

of the rules of conduct on

which the Group has always
based its activities, according

to Lamberti’s longstanding
values and rules of behavior.

The purpose of adopting the
Code is to meet the needs and
expectations of all those who
interact with Lamberti, inside and
outside the Group.

The recipients of the Code of
Ethics must comply, and ensure
that others comply, with the
contents of this Code, with

no exceptions or distinctions
whatsoever, in Italy or abroad.
Acting for the benefit of the
Group does not justify any party
from behaving in contrast to the
principles and rules of conduct
established by Lamberti. All
recipients must operate in a way
that ensures the satisfactory
application of these regulations
both within the Group andin
general, by all its stakeholders.

Precautionary
Principle

The Responsible Industrial
Manufacturing is one of Lamberti
funding values. Therefore, all

the reasonable precautionary
measures are taken, even
beyond statutory requirements,
when planning, developing and
launching products as well as

in plant design and operation.
The target is to minimize and to
avoid negative consequences
on the environment and on all
the stakeholders (e.g. customers,
employees, local communities).

Supervisory Board

In compliance with the
organizational and management
model for the prevention of
crimes listed in the Italian
Legislative Decree 231/2001
(hereinafter “231 Model") and
any related laws, Lamberti
appointed a Supervisory
Board. It coordinates its
activities with other bodies and
departments responsible for
the correct implementation
and operation of control and
monitoring. In performing its
duties, the Supervisory Board
also collaborates with company
bodies and managers that

have to lead by example and
ensure their daily behavior is
coherent with the rules of the
Code of Ethics. In order to raise
awareness regarding the Code,
the group guarantees free
access to all documentation
regarding the organizational and
management model and the
Code of Ethics

Whistleblowing

We have set up a whistleblowing
system, a system that provides
employees with a way to report
unacceptable conduct while
protecting the whistleblower’s
identity and their right to
confidentiality. The Group

has also introduced specific
penalties applied in the event

of retaliatory or discriminatory
acts to the detriment of the
whistleblower.

We promote the adoption of
measures designed to prevent,
discover and communicate
unlawful conduct and/or
behaviors carried out in breach
of the ethical principles adopted
by the Group, and encourage our
legal representatives, directors,
managers and employees to
report any breaches that may
come to their knowledge.
Matters subject to reporting are:

 

Unlawful behaviors comprising
one or more types of the crime
for which the organization can
be considered liable, pursuant
to Italian Legislative Decree
231/01;

Behaviors that, although not

constituting any type of crime,

were performed in violation of

the rules of ethics and conduct,
procedures, protocols and

provisions contained within the

231 Model and the Code of Ethics.

 

n both 2019 and 2018, seven
of eight Lamberrti’s Italian sites
were assessed for risks related

‘0 corruption in compliance
with the 231 Model, which
corresponds to 88% of our
talian operations. At the Group
evel, no confirmed incidents

of corruption were recorded
during the past two years.
Lamberti S.p.A. did not detect
any non-compliance with law
and regulations in the social and
economic areas. In 2020, we plan
‘o assess our Spanish subsidiary,
hen extend the assessment to
our other affiliates over the next
years.

loreover, also in the
environmental area no significant
inancial penalties have

been registered for violation

of environmental laws and
regulations at Group level, while
here is only one case of non-
monetary sanction.
