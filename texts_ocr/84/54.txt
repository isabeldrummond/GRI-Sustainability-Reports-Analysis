Methodological

Note

This document is the first
Sustainability Report of

the Lamberti Group and

aims to highlight Lamberti’s
achievements regarding
economic, social and
environmental aspects. The
report describes initiatives

and main results in terms of
sustainability performance
covering the period from January
Ist to December 31st 2019 and
illustrates the commitment of the
Group to creating value for all

its stakeholders. Figures relating
to previous years are provided
solely for comparative purposes
to enable an assessment of the
Group’s activities over a longer
period.

This report has been prepared
in accordance with the GRI
Standards -- Core option
(hereinafter “GRI Standards’),
defined in 2016 by the GRI -
Global Reporting Initiative. These
Standards were selected as the
reporting framework by the
Group due to their international
recognition and because they
make it possible to prepare a
complete, clear and comparable
report. The GRI Standards’

106

principles for defining report
content and quality have been
duly considered to guarantee the
reliability of the reporting.

The contents and indicators
subject to reporting were
selected from the results of the
materiality analysis described in
the section “Our material topics”
of this document and the details
of the disclosures reported

are shown in the table “GRI
Content Index” on page 108.
The materiality analysis allowed
for the identification of the most
relevant sustainability issues for
Lamberti and for its stakeholders.

The reporting scope includes the
10 countries where the Group
has significant manufacturing
operations (Italy, France, Russia,
Spain, Brazil, Mexico, USA,
China, India and Indonesia). The
impact of all other commercial
offices (Hong Kong, South Korea,
United Arab Emirates, Germany,
Turkey, Canada, Poland,
Argentina, South Africa and
Colombia) on the performance
indicators at the consolidated
level is not deemed significant.
For figures related to economic

performance, all Group activities
are included and the scope of
the Report corresponds to the
2019 consolidated financial
statements, unless otherwise
indicated. Any specifications
and exceptions to the reporting
scope are clearly indicated in
their relevant sections. To ensure
the reliability of the data, the use
of estimates was limited as much
as possible. Whenever present,
proper explanations of the
issues are provided within the
document.
