Employees development

 

“Kids in the Office (Bimbi in ufficio)”:
isan opportunity for all employees’
children to discover what mom and
dad do at work. With this initiative, we
endeavour to break down the barriers
between working life and private life.

 

For children, itis alearning experience
and astep towards acceptance of
detachment from parents; for parents,
itis an opportunity to share a part of
their personal life with colleagues.

 

Bimbi in Ufficio includes workshops,
age-appropriate games and fun,

all designed to make the parents
workplace known to children.
