Our group also considers
collective bargaining
agreements when defining
contract terms for the employees
in the several countries where
we operate. Today, 70 % of

our employees group-wide

are covered by this kind of
agreement, with percentages
varying across the regions. In
Italy 100% of our employees are
covered by collective bargaining
agreements, while in Europe
and in America the percentage
decreases to 54% and 30%
respectively. Employees in Asia
have no collective bargaining
agreements in place.
