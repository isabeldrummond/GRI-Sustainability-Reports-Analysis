We are committed to
developing high performance
products incompliance with
the most demanding regulatory
standards, according to
customers’ requirements as
well as our ethical values, thus
providing benefits in terms

of both sustainability and
performance. This approach
also benefits the downstream
value chain, since our products’
performance can help to reduce
the environmental and social
impact of our customers and final
consumers.

Our Innovation process is open
and multidisciplinary to include
the fields of Chemistry, Biology
and Physics. We are moving
from the concept of Customer/
Product to that of User Need/
Function.

We aim to widen the horizon,
think about the day after
tomorrow and anticipate future
needs. To this end, we constantly
seek further experience,
increased knowledge and
sensitive antennae to read weak
signals that may emerge.

 

We strive to achieve these
objectives by engaging with
customers, suppliers and with
universities and other scientific
institutions.

We also invest extensively in
Intellectual Property, which is
strategic to protecting ourselves
while remaining open to external
contributions. In addition, it
provides a strong stimulus to go
beyond the State of the Art and
to develop better solutions.
