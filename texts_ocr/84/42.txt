People and social responsibility
Our people

Our people

As a global company, we aim

to provide value for the society
that goes beyond our financial
and economic results. Our
communities are strategic
stakeholders and we work closely
with them to advance values of
mutual benefit. We have chosen
to grow our business according
to the value of proximity to our
suppliers, clients and consumers,
while simultaneously respecting
and enhancing the local
community.

We aim to design a framework
where inclusion, equality and
diversity are cornerstone values
across our entire organization.
The working environment

we strive for is based on
entrepreneurship and constant
professional evolution. This is our
idea for the future of our people.

Designing a new idea of value

We seek constant interaction
with our personnel and the

local communities because we
share common interests and
values. The commitment we hold
towards our personnel is both
socially responsible and actively
promotes common values
through new ideas.

Our people are the backbone
of our organization and vital
partners to achieve continuous
growth in our business.

Our idea of personal
development: People First
(People as individuals)

Asa global company, we are
strongly focused on corporate
ethics and human rights ,

which are a cornerstone of our
commitment towards social
responsibility. For many years, we
have developed our own Code of
Ethics, which aims to provide the
guidelines upon which Lamberti
has always based all its activities.
We are committed to spreading
the values and guidelines of our
Code of Ethics across the entire
organization.

We believe in our human
resources as responsible

individuals and they are the main
driver for social and cultural
development in our organization.
For these reasons, Lamberti
firmly opposes all discriminatory
behaviours intended to harm
people and their beliefs. We

are committed to proactively
creating a working environment
where relationships among
personnel at all levels are based
on equality, mutual respect

and integrity. These values are
part of our core beliefs. We are
equally committed to promoting
diversity as an integral part our
business and our everyday life.
Consequently, through these
activities our people can take
pride in working for a company
that puts People first.

The strength of our organization
lays in the 1,311 employees

who, every day, contribute to its
positive outcomes. As already
indicated, not all Lamberti’s
affiliates have been considered in
the data collection, thus the KPI's
are reported as a total of 1,256
employees.

In comparison to 2018, the
number of employees decreased
by 1.9%, mainly due to the decline
in fixed-term contracts (-50%).
