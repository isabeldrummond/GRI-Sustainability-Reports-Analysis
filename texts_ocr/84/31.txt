Circularity in Products

Circularity
in Products

The circular economy is about
changing the simple “take-
make-dispose” approach to
resources, where materials are
made into products, which are
then used and thrown away.

Our circularity approach focuses
on the need to create closed
loops of material flows, improve
the use of renewable feedstock,
and reduce the consumption of
non-renewable resources.

Since the 70s’, we have been
developing processes and
products using our natural
polymer and oleochemistry
technologies. Our current
portfolio includes a number of
products based on cellulose,
polysaccharides, alcohols and
acids of plant-based origin.
The use of renewable raw
materials is also a pillar for
further developments, including
promotion of the use of recycled
materials in our production
processes, reduction of wastes
disposal, including hazardous
wastes, decreasing the amount
of greenhouse gases (GHG)
emitted, and switching to
renewable raw materials for
industrial application.

 

Lamberti
Sustainability Report 2019

Our commitment is to increase
the number of our products
coming from renewable raw
materials from 30% (2019) to
35%(2022).

We plan to offer new
technological solutions, adopting
our products, to improve the
sustainability of our customers’
processes. In addition, we plan

to accelerate the adoption of

life cycle assessment (LCA) to
assess the benefit of products
and processes based on
Lamberti sustainable products,
with a comprehensive analysis

of breakdown of product
emissions. This process is starting
now and will be implemented
progressively in several business
sectors, already in 2021.
