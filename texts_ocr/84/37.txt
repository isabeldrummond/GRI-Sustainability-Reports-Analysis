Emission of greenhouse gases

“In 2019 we reduced our CO2e
emissions (Scope 1+ Scope 2
location-based) by 6.5%, equal to

4988 tons of CO2e.’

Our Scope 1 emissions, which
fell by 2.4% in 2019 compared
to 2018, include emissions
deriving from the use of natural
gas, diesel, LPG, petrol and
refrigerant gases (which have a
stratospheric ozone depletion
potential equal to O CFC-11).
Conversely, Scope 2 emissions
included our use of electricity
and steam. Overall, Scope 2 both
location-based and market-
based emissions decreased
compared to 2018, by 11% and
10% respectively.

Our concern about
environmental quality is not
limited to GHG emissions.

Our production plants are
equipped with the Best Available
Techniques (BAT), in order

to reduce air emissions. This
translates into an environmental
benefit: in 2019, we cut our NOx
emissions by 7% and our SOx
emissions by 1.5%.
