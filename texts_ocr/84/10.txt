Regarding the supply chain,

he chemicals sector typically
eatures large amounts of raw
materials and many suppliers,
due to the high number of
inished products tailored

or numerous and varied
applications. The constant
volatility of the demand for
materials significantly influences
he supply chain management.
For this reason, we are currently
undertaking a project of revision
and reorganization for the
optimization of our supply chain.

 

Procurement management of
both raw materials and services

isa primary strategy for Lamberti.
