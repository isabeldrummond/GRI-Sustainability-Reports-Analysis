Sharing knowledge

As part of our ongoing crisis
preparedness approach, we
organize an annual closed-
door seminar called “Sharing
Knowledge”. Its objective

is the open sharing of crisis
preparedness and management
experiences and best practices
among like-minded companies
and selected individuals. We
recently organized one such
seminar with strategic partners
with the objective of raising
awareness of the importance of
crisis preparation and sharing
our approach to managing
unexpected critical events.

Patrick Trancu added his
thoughts on the seminar:

 

Patrick Balletto strongly
emphasized the relevance of the

seminar:

 

“The chemical industry has a very complex
value chain. Through this seminar, we

shared how we manage a crisis with our key
partners with the aim of contributing to the
development of their own crisis preparedness

  
 
 
 

efforts. The seminar was extremely useful for us
too; it has strengthened key aspects of our own
crisis Management approach and procedures”.

Covid-2019

Although events fall beyond

he timeframe of this report, it
seems appropriate to mention
our response to the Covid-2019
Coronavirus pandemic. Although
Lamberti’s crisis management
ramework has been extensively
ested in simulations and applied
‘Oo minor incidents in the past,

he Coronavirus emergency has
recently provided an opportunity
‘0 use it “in action”.

Our Crisis Management
Team responded rapidly and
worked throughout the crisis
o anticipate events. Direct
ines of communication were

 

established and maintained
with all relevant stakeholders.

Sustainability Report 2019

Employees, trade unions, local
authorities including mayors,
local communities, suppliers

and customers were constantly
updated with company
decisions and initiatives. Health
related measures were quickly
introduced company-wide to
protect employees and their
families, often ahead of national
and regional directives and
regulations. PPE was sourced
ahead of time and supplied to
both our employees and local
authorities. We also established a
psychological support telephone
line free of charge for employees
in Italy and their families.

Our company’s response to the
Covid emergency has drawn
praise from all stakeholders.

“Crisis preparedness and managementisa
process of continuous learning and “Sharing
Knowledge” marked a key milestone on our
path. Sharing knowledge with both partners
and experts has been invaluable. It has also
given us some food for thought for further
improvements.”
