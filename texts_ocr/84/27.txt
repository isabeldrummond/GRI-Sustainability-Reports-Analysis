Sustainability

Sustainable development is an
integral part of our Vision and
Values and embraces the three
dimensions of our Group: the
company, the economy and the
environment.

We specifically focus on strategic
areas to measure and enhance
the sustainability of our products:

1. Products non-hazardous to
the environment

2. Natural Based Products

3. Environmental properties

Products non-hazardous

to the environment

The protection of the
environment is a great challenge
for any chemical company.
Throughout these years,
Lamberti has paid increasing
attention to the ecotoxicological
properties of its products in order
to reduce the number and the
quantity of products hazardous
to the environment.

Now, more than 90% of the
products we manufacture are
classified non-hazardous to the
environment. The percentage
increased in the last 3 years and
we intend to maintain this trend
in the future. The same index for
raw materials decreased slightly
in the same period, but there is
still room for improvement.

Natural Based products

The use of natural origin
materials is a key aspect of

our strategy. We are following
different approaches: using palm
oil, palm kernel oil, and their
derivatives that are certified by
the Roundtable on Sustainable
Palm Oil (RSPO), and improving
bio-based raw materials for the
manufacture of polymers.

Among the several available
options to verify the naturalness
index of our products, we have

chosen to apply the criteria of the
ISO 16128 standard: Guidelines
on definitions and criteria for
natural and organic cosmetic
ingredients and products. Our
evaluation started with the
GeoScience, Agriculture and
Personal Care portfolios, and
presented the following results:
36,5% of the total number of
products were recognized to

be natural, while in terms of the
volume of natural products, the
total amount now reaches 53,9%.
