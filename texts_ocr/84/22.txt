importance to us. Indeed,

their importance, economic
and financial performances are

featured in our materiality matrix.

In terms of economic and
financial performance, we
have seen a 1.2% increase in

our core revenues, reaching €
509 million in 2019 compared
to € 503 million in 2018.

This change is certainly
appreciable, given the persisting
conditions of uncertainty

that have characterized the
macroeconomic scenario in the
recent past and are expected to
continue in the near future.

With respect to cost structure,
the effect of a significant
decrease in the impact of raw
materials cost on turnover
should be highlighted (55.6%
in 2019 compared to 57.4% in
2018). This figure is in contrast
to the trend of increasing costs
of raw materials and can be due,
in part, to the decline of the US
dollar, the currency used fora

The overall financial comparison
with the previous year points out
asignificant increase in operating
income’, which rose from €

35.3 million in 2018 to € 43.3
million in 2019 (increasing by € 8
million) and the gross operating
margin*, which increased by € 7
million and stood at 12.3% of sales
revenues.

In 2019, the geographical distribution of revenues confirmed that foreign markets make up the main sales
hub of the Lamberti Group, with a share equal to 89% of the total turnover (versus 88% in 2018); while non-
EU markets on total foreign sales reached 85.4%, substantially unchanged compared to the previous year
(85.3%).
