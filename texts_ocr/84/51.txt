At Lamberti we have a solid,
longstanding relationship with
our local communities and are
fully aware of our responsibility
towards them. Maintaining
positive, respectful relationships
with the communities where

we operate constitutes part of
our daily activities as well as an
integral part of our corporate
mission. Our Group shall include
and take the local communities
into consideration, both in our
daily activities and in our most

Training Island (Isola
Formativa)

We maintain an inclusive
working environment for people
with disabilities. We have
created a place where people
can develop their specific skills
based on the idea of mutual
enrichment.

Since 2012 in our Albizzate
plant, we have collaborated
with special-needs individuals
on ajob-training program for
an agreed-upon period. During
this period we have enabled the
participants, with the support of
a dedicated person, to perform
different types of activities,
according to their attitudes and
capabilities. At the end of the
work experience some of the
people have been hired with

a full time contract and they
continue to actively contribute to
the growth of our business.
