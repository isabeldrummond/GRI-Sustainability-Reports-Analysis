widely varied customer base
operating in many different
industries. Close cooperation
and partnership with our clients
are of utmost importance to

us, since it enables us to builda

Coupled with an understanding
of strategic customers’ needs,
the two elements are crucial

for our Group to anticipate new
trends and stay a step ahead of
our competitors.

Innovation doesn’t only mean
inventing something new.
Within our business approach,
innovation often means finding
new applications for existing
technologies

A reliable value chain is further
key aspect to operating
responsibly and safely in our
business. It is therefore of utmost
importance for us to source our
raw materials from suppliers who
share our values and principles
for doing business. We work
closely with them in order to
identify potential risk factors

as well as new procurement
solutions.
