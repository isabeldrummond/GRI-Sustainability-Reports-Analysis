Our approach to sustainability

An engagement
approach

To succeed with our sustainability
agenda, broad stakeholder
involvement is crucial. Internally,
we have seta “blueprint”

to promote adoption of a
company-wide sustainability
culture, emphasizing not only
environmental, but also social
and economic benefits.

Our approach rejects “green
washing” or meaningless
marketing campaigns.
Sustainability efforts

and initiatives, if wisely
communicated to the larger
workforce, are more likely to be
accepted as a credible, positive

benefit to all stakeholders.
Therefore, a coordinated internal
promotion effort is key to
successful engagement. A failure
to adopt Sustainability principles
could result in reputational risk,
not only for employees, but

also for external stakeholders.
Lamberti fully supports the
adoption of a Sustainability
culture and is committed to
including all stakeholders in this
endeavor.

Our approach to engagement

is based on the Stakeholder
Engagement Standard
AAIOOOSES, which outlines four
steps:

1. Plan: Profile and map
stakeholders, define
engagement level method,
establish and communicate
boundaries of disclosure, draft an
engagement plan and establish
indicators;

2. Prepare: Mobilize financial,
human and technical resources,
build capabilities to engage,
identify and prepare for
engagement risks;

3. Implement: Invite
stakeholders to engage, brief
stakeholders, engage, document
the engagement and its outputs,
develop an action plan and,
communicate engagement
outputs and action plan;

4. Act, Review and Improve:
Monitor and evaluate the
engagement, learn and improve,
follow up on action plan and
report on the stakeholder
engagement.
