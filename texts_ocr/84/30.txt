Product Safety
and Stewardship

The safety and the
environmental impact of

our products is monitored
throughout production, starting
from research and development,
all the way to the customer’s
application. We follow a number
of procedures and guidelines
based on Health, Safety and
Environment (HSE) regulations.

We are committed to minimizing
the negative effects of our
products on the environment,
health and safety along the value
chain - from development to
disposal.

In 2019 alone, we put more

than 500 new products on

the market, providing a set of
HSE information as part of our
procedure aimed at carrying out
an internal risk assessment, an
established company procedure,
and verifying more than 150
specific parameters for safety,
reactivity, chemical and physical
properties, and transportation.
The number of items evaluated
in 2019 grew considerably in
comparison to those examined in
2018, increasing from 215 to 367.

The commitment to product
stewardship is embodied in our
Responsible Care® charter
and follows the initiatives of

the International Council of
Chemical Associations (ICCA).
We also ensure uniformly

high standards for product
stewardship worldwide. In some
cases, we have committed to
voluntary initiatives, which go
beyond local legal requirements.

More than 99% of our product
portfolio is covered by safety
data sheets, for hazardous as
well as non-hazardous materials,
available in Italian, English and all
pertinent languages.

We also support:

« the Global Product
Strategy (GPS) of the ICCA,
worldwide standards and
best practices to improve
the safety management of
chemical substances;
the development and
certification for Good
Manufacturing Practices
(GMP) for the manufacture
of cosmetic ingredients;
the CEFIC REACH Dossier
Improvement Action Plan’
, as part of the continuous
improvement of the quality
of REACH dossier, which
represents our current
and future commitments,
investing relevant human
and financial resources.

Finally, taking into account our
portfolio and the request of the
customer application sectors,
our vision is to certify products
in the areas of textile/leather,
and cosmetic ingredients.

We aim to do so by adopting
certifications that follow different
aspects of production, product
characteristics and are primarily
focused on environmental
impact (toxicity, environmental
fate, wastewater, etc.) along with
workers’ and consumers’ safety.
These standards also consider
the circularity of products,
starting from material safety

and material reutilization,
specifically targeting natural raw
material sources and production
processes, and reducing the

use of technologies with high
environmental impact.

Procedures, instructions, IT tools
are regularly revised, assessed
and updated to verify the
compliance of the information
provided with mandatory,
internal and stakeholder rules
and requirements. Internal and/
or external auditing is carried out
to verify the completeness of
safety data sheets and the results
are then included in the Health,
Safety, Environment and Quality
Report, which is overseen by the
Group General Management.
