WHY THESE ISSUES ARE RELEVANT

Intesa Sanpaolo attributes a key role to projects focused on the economic, social, cultural and civil
growth of the communities in which it operates: financing the real economy, supporting those in need
and the Third Sector, sustainable investments and investments in innovation, and promoting Italy's
artistic heritage are long-standing commitments and an indelible part of the Group’s history and business
approach.

As such, in line with the corporate mission, the Group is focused on providing top-quality banking,
financial and insurance products and services to its customers, fostering the development of the areas
in which it operates.

As outlined in the 2018-2021 Business Plan, Intesa Sanpaolo intends to maintain the sustainable
growth of the business through the active involvement of its employees and its cutting-edge digital
infrastructure. Thanks to these two enabling factors, Intesa Sanpaolo is able to provide its customers
with innovative, high-quality products, expanding its range of services and available channels, as well
as their accessibility.

Another equally important aspect is the ability to satisfy its customers through an operational structure
that offers simple solutions, tailored to their needs and closely focused on IT security and the physical
safety of customers, also thanks to the continuous reinforcement of the controls implemented by the
Group, while maintaining a responsible and transparent approach when it comes to relations.

Its support for the real economy enables it to guarantee deserving businesses financial support also in
times of difficulty, helping them to develop innovative restructuring, revitalisation and growth solutions.
The Group’s activities benefiting society also include initiatives to support the Third Sector and the
financial inclusion of groups that find it difficult to access credit despite their potential, in particular young
people with their educational and training needs.

The range of sustainable investments and the availability of insurance solutions for the protection of
customers are other key examples of the Group’s responsible approach.

With the 2018-2021 Business Plan, Intesa Sanpaolo wants to be the point of reference for communities
and their growth, embracing social challenges and developing partnerships, including in the cultural
sphere, to meet emerging needs in an efficient and innovative way.
