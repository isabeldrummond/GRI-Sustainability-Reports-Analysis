The Bank also supports research and study institutes, focusing on people and family behaviour, and more
specifically, the Rapporto Giovani (Young people Report) published by the Toniolo Institute. This study examines
young people in relation to politics and public engagement, with projects on the themes of family, careers and
the future. In addition, there is the collaboration with the Luigi Einaudi Research and Documentation Centre on
savings research and on Italians’ financial choices, with a view to compiling a report on the choices and habits
of families, focusing on their spending priorities, and new consumer and savings models.

In 2019 the Bank once again gave its support as Main Partner to the Food&Science Festival in Mantua. This
major national and international science event hosts three days of conferences, laboratories and workshops to
thoroughly examine and tackle issues related to food production and consumption in a creative and accessible
manner.

With regard to inclusion, the Bank together with the Bellisario Foundation, promoted the fourth iteration of
Women Value Company, a prize awarded to small and medium-sized enterprises that have stood out for
implementing gender equality policies, to ensure men and women have equal opportunities and recognition
in their careers.

As stated in the 2018-2021 Business Plan, the Group has included the topic of inclusion among its strategic
corporate objectives with the aim of enhancing the wealth of multicultural backgrounds, experiences and
different qualities of the Group's people, favouring the affirmation of an inclusive approach within the Company,
encouraging respect and appreciation of diversity through the implementation of projects addressing its various
dimensions and also providing for the direct involvement of the Bank's managers in the development of female
talent.

As evidence of Intesa Sanpaolo's commitment to these issues, in 2019 it supported a series of initiatives in this
area:

« About Women, a series of dialogues on the role of women in society and work as part of the Venice Film
Festival, focused on the topics of the salary gap and gender discrimination in the professional field;

* Global Inclusion, an initiative set up with the intention of furthering the contribution of inclusion policies within

companies as a competitive lever for the development of organisations;

Tempo delle Donne: more than 100 meetings and a large project that many associations, museums, cultural

and social centres participated in with workshops, meetings, concerts and neighbourhood parties;

Inspiring Girls: a project promoted by Valore D, an association founded in 2009 and that for ten years has

been committed to gender balance and an inclusive culture in organisations and in our country with over

200 member companies, organising a series of meetings in lower secondary schools throughout Italy with

women (Role Model) working with passion and success in a wide range of sectors and professional roles,

and who with their testimonies can inspire girls not to set limits in defining their own careers and broaden the
horizons of girls and boys in imagining their futures.

STEMintheCITY: an initiative promoted by the Municipality of Milan with the support of the United Nations

having the objective of removing the cultural stereotypes that alienate girls from technical-scientific schooling

and careers, reducing the gender gap in this area and spreading the STEM culture. Meetings, seminars,
training courses and shows to promote technical-scientific subjects and to spread digital culture.

Also with the Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center, business models of the future were explored to create

assets and the necessary skills to support competitiveness over the long-term, and to act as a driver and an

impetus in the new economy in Italy, with a specific focus on the more significant trends in our society, such
as Industry 4.0 and the Circular Economy.

* The various initiatives include the Bheroes programme, a platform that allows the Bank to get into contact
with new start-ups that are emerging on the economic scene, and promote those that are already customers,
by providing acceleration, training and support programmes for them to grow, based on courses for men-
toring, training support, empowerment, coaching, promotions and communications support, and access to
backers. It also encourages the meeting between established companies and start-ups, creating points of
connection and cultivating growth and acceleration processes.

Other projects in this field worth mentioning relate to:

* Milan Digital Week, an initiative that sees all of Milan digitally "connected", with more than 400 events
across the city for residents. The initiative takes place over four days of discussions, exhibitions, points of
interest, seminars, performances, shows, workshops, training courses and laboratories to discover the most
unexpected aspects of digital Milan;

« Master TAG in Digital Transformation for Made in Italy, a training course that seeks to ensure the future growth
of the Italian economy by educating professionals able to navigate companies through the digitalisation
process, based on the implementation of new strategies, the use of digital technologies, and the creation of
a new business culture.

Bank has also contributed together with Friends for Health Onlus and the A. Gemelli Policlinico Universitario
