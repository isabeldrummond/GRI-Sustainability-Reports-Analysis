CONN OT Co NS

Intesa Sanpaolo is aware of the fact that many of the objectives set in the 2018-2021 Business Plan are strictly
connected with certain Sustainable Development Goals. This link is also confirmed by the materiality analysis, which
highlighted the importance of certain issues both in terms of impact on the Group’s strategies and on its stakeholders.
Therefore, the link with the Business Plan and the material issues (namely the topics that the materiality analysis
has shown to be of key importance) have been bolstered by the various Sustainable Development Goals, as well
as with the actions, projects and results of greatest significance in terms of their positive effects on the community.
This approach is proof of the Group’s contribution to generating positive change at a global level, through a
commitment that, considering the loans granted by the Group to support families and businesses, it extends to all
SDGs and is focused on 11 objectives in particular.
