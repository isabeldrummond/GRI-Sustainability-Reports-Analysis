The use of Danube tablets for gathering signatures during transactions in Privredna Banka Zagreb -PBZ in
Croatia, VUB Banka in Slovakia, Intesa Sanpaolo Bosna i Hercegovina, CIB Bank in Hungary, Intesa Sanpaolo
Bank in Slovenia contributed to the dematerialisation of contracts and simplified and improved the Customer
Experience.

CREDIT INNOVATION

The activity of granting credit to retail customers in terms of products and processes is also carried out in a
multi-channel perspective. In fact, the offer received from the traditional branch can be completed and concluded
by customers conveniently from their mobile devices, independently or with the assistance of the branch. Over
70% of approved credit applications are evaluated automatically and granted within 24 hours, completing the
disbursement within about 48 hours for 90% of the cases. In consumer credit, with the PerTe Prestito Diretto
product the Bank makes it possible, in self-service mode, to purchase interest-free products from an extensive
catalogue of consumer durables. The product range is supplemented with the constant presence of the Online
Branch, which assists customers from the purchasing stages through to the home delivery of their goods. The
innovation involves the home mortgage sector with the product "Mutuo in Tasca", intended for customers looking
for a property who can ask the Bank to decide the maximum amount of credit that can be granted to them; at the
end of 2019 there were more than 9,300 subscribers, with more than 1,500 customers who identified a house to
buy and were granted a loan.

ACCESSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

Accessibility for visually impaired or blind customers is made available in Italy thanks to automatic
teller machines equipped with an interface featuring easy-to-read graphics for the visually impaired,
while for the blind over 6,400 machines are equipped with headphones for listening to voice guidance.
The monitoring of the accessibility and usability of buildings and services led to the conclusion of the
census of 4,576 operating points (consisting mainly of Retail, Personal, Business, Private and Corporate
branches, satellite agencies of the various branch types, and detached and company branches) out of
a total of 5,460, i.e. about 84% of coverage (the former Venetian banks excluded), inspecting the user-
friendliness of automated equipment and the accessibility of various areas with the use of tactile flooring
for visually impaired and blind people. You can find specific information on the accessibility of branches
on the Intesa Sanpaolo website [i].

In particular, there is information on the accessibility of branches and self-service areas for individuals
with reduced mobility; visitors can also find out if there are accessible cashier desks, accessible toilets,
adequate space for manoeuvring in corridors, tactile flooring for the visually impairedand blind, lifts or
lifting platforms, or stair lifts to connect the various floors.

In International Subsidiary Banks, as part of the DigiCal model, the updating of Web-WCAG 2.0 (Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines) applications continues, with a service in English and in the local
language.

Within the scope of the International Subsidiary Banks, in 2019 a survey of the Banks’ sites was
carried out on the entire network of branches and head offices (more than 900 sites) to verify the
state of accessibility according to a series of common parameters (accessibility from outside, to tellers,
managers, etc.) and identifying improvements to be performed throughout the scope. Accessibility to
branches from the outside varies between 38% and 91% depending on the country, with the highest
rates for Privredna Banka Zagreb-PBZ in Croatia (91%), Intesa Sanpaolo Bank in Slovenia (82%), CIB
Bank in Hungary (72%) and VUB Banka in Slovakia and Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Romania (70%).

Intesa Sanpaolo has also been cooperating with the Fondazione LIA (Libri Italiani Accessibili - Accessible
Italian Books Foundation), which has been working for years with Associazione Italiana Editori (the
Italian Publishers Association) and Unione Italiana Ciechi e |povedenti (Italian Association for the Blind
and Visually Impaired) to improve the accessibility of its documents published on the Internet and on
the Intranet.
