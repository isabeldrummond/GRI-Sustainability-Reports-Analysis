The commitment to sustainable investments continued and the Group confirms its position as the leading
operator in Italy with 39 funds (ethical and ESG), approximately 8.4 billion worth of assets and a market share
of over 27%.

Consistently with its commitment to the social environment and the community, the Group disbursed over
86 million euro as contribution, thus being one of the leading players in the social area in Italy. An important
initiative undertaken by the Group concerned the promotion of social inclusion; in 2018 and 2019, the support
provided to charity bodies and associations, allowed for 8.7 million meals and over 519,000 beds to be offered,
131,000 medicines to be provided, and 103,000 items of clothing to be given out. The Charity Fund, through
which the Bank allocates a share of the profits to support projects of solidarity, social benefit and the value of
individuals, disbursed 12.9 million euro in 2019. Work also continued on disseminating financial culture, with
particular attention being paid to young people and socially and economically disadvantaged groups.

The responsibility to defend, promote and share the Italian historical and artistic heritage represents a
commitment that has become intrinsic to Intesa Sanpaolo’s identity and role. In 2019, Gallerie d'Italia received
over 560,000 visitors and 80,000 students took advantage of free educational activities. With the opening -
scheduled in 2022 - of the Gallerie d'Italia museum in Turin after those of Milan, Naples and Vicenza, Intesa
Sanpaolo becomes the first banking Group in the world to have four museums open to the public.

The commitment to the environment translated not only in the offer of sustainable investments and loans
dedicated to the green and circular economy but also in the actions put in place to improve efficiency and
reduce the Group's environmental impact, which led to a decrease in the Group's CO, emissions of over 21%
in 2019. In addition, the environmental certifications were extended to all the branches and buildings in Italy,
while the Turin Skyscraper received the highest international recognition (LEED Platinum) for the sustainable
management of buildings.

Attention and commitment to the people working in the Group continued - those same people who enable
the achievement of all the strategic objectives - through development, growth, training (approximately 11
million hours of training provided this year) and welfare initiatives. In particular, the 2018-2021 Strategic Plan
confirms, as in the past, the importance Intesa Sanpaolo attaches to job protection: in 2019 more than 2,000
people were involved in professional reallocation and training programmes. The Group has promoted a series
of measures and interventions that have significantly contributed to the enhancement of diversity, inclusion and
organisational well-being (including the extension of the flexible work scheme to some 17,250 employees).
Attention to female talent promotion also continued: in 2019, the performance evaluation for approximately
1,100 managers also included dedicated indicators.

The actions and results achieved in 2019 demonstrate the extent of the Group's commitment to sustainability,
which is increasingly the focus of our stakeholders’ choices and assessments. In particular, 2019 witnessed
a great degree of mobilisation in favour of the environment, with a strong commitment also from the European
authorities. Aware of the significant impact that Group's activities can have in this area, Intesa Sanpaolo
has made available, within the European Green Deal, 50 billion euro for the green economy in Italy. Lastly,
a wide-ranging internal project with a significant impact - ISP4ESG - was launched, which involved all the
Group's areas and structures, with the aim of consolidating Intesa Sanpaolo's leadership in sustainability,
leveraging more effectively the evolution of the external context and better responding to the expectations of
our stakeholders.
