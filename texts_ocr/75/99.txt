PROJECTS TO SUPPORT CHILDREN

In its active role in support of the communities it operates in, the Group also carries out initiatives supporting
children by working with significant inclusion projects.

INTESA SANPAOLO'S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE LONG-TERM PATIENTS

In 2019, the Bank continued to support children in long-term care in oncology wards and their families, offering
free nurseries to children aged 0-3, helping them with cognitive and emotional development through specifically
designed programmes and qualified educators and providing mothers with significant support as, in most
cases, they directly care for their child during their period of hospitalisation.

The Programme, in partnership with local cooperatives that form part of the PAN Consortium, is active in
cutting-edge hospitals in Padua, Bologna, Turin, Naples, Monza and Genoa.

Since the service was launched, 100% of the children of pre-school age in the hospitals have been included in
the long-term patient programme with positive results: healthcare and educational staff have noted considerable
psychological and behavioural improvements in the 320 children involved.

WEBECOME - INCLUSIVE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS

In 2017, Intesa Sanpaolo launched an innovative inclusive education programme aimed at primary school
children to promote their inclusion and development of positive behaviour, responding to the need to address
critical issues emerging in the area of childhood anxiety. The first phase of the project has come to a close,
and addressed issues such as digital civic education, bullying and cyberbullying, diversity, addictions, food and
nutrition (with a considerable focus on obesity and malnutrition), innovation and the development of individual
potential. The issues were structured into eight courses, each with specific letters from the ‘Alphabet for Growth’
characterising them: M for maps to provide a guide to childhood disorders, U for uniqueness, T for together, C
for closeness, F for flavour, A for aptitude, W for well-being, and R for relations. The free online platform at [i],
available at all times, has educational videos featuring experts, training videos, in-depth content and planning
tools in order to organise engaging and positive educational experiences in class. Parents are offered sets of
useful information to learn more about and help combat childhood anxiety, that can also help them to develop
the potential of their children. Now that the design and setup phase has been completed, Webecome is being
disseminated both within the Group, with the internal communication campaign "Porta a Scuola Webecome”
(Take Webecome to School), and externally with the participation of the project team at conferences in various
Italian cities including Bologna, Pordenone, Trieste, Turin and Milan, and at presentations in primary schools
throughout the country.

More than 1,000 schools were involved through an active relationship with Headteachers and Education
Councillors. Over 11,000 people have visited the platform and there are more than 5,000 active users.

QUBi PROGRAMME — QUANTO BASTA

To combat a terrible phenomenon such as child poverty, which affects about 20,000 minors and 10,000 families
in Milan alone, the QuBi Programme was launched together with Fondazione Cariplo and partners Fondazione
Vismara, Fondazione Fiera Milano and Fondazione Snam. The Bank supports the initiative with a donation
of 3 million euro and promotes fundraising through its own tools like the For Funding crowdfunding platform.

The first important result was the creation of an integrated archive of administrative data on poverty in Milan,
the creation of two Banco Alimentare hubs, the opening of four Caritas Solidarity Emporiums, and the creation
of 23 Third Sector networks in 25 priority neighbourhoods of the city with the aim of building a system to
support people and promote the activation of communities.

ASSOCIAZIONE PER MILANO

The Bank is a Founding Member of the Milan Association for those most in need, particularly disabled and
socially vulnerable children. Last year the Association supported ten projects involved in medical and dental
care, the creation of spaces suitable for recreational purposes, the development of assistance programmes for
young people with motor disabilities, and workshops to help socialise young people with autism.
