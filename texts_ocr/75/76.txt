MICROFINANCE AND THE FIGHT AGAINST USURY

There are various partnerships with different entities to provide credit to individuals or small companies in difficulty.
Altogether, in 2019 the Group disbursed about 75 million euro in microfinance or anti-usury projects, in Italy and
abroad.

The longest-term initiative is the “Prestito della Speranza” loan, promoted since 2010 by the Episcopal Conference
of Italy and the Italian Banking Association to support families in temporary difficulty by supporting the start-up of
small businesses. The project subsequently focused on Intesa Sanpaolo by providing from 2015 to 2019 about 44.4
million euro for over 5,700 loans, of which 900 in the last two years for about 7.3 million euro. The typical mechanism
for the “Prestito della Speranza” loan, whereby an entity — generally philanthropic or religious — provides money for
a guarantee fund set up with the Group associated with an agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo, has been replicated
with a number of counterparties.

Noteworthy initiatives include Intesa Sanpaolo’s partnership with Fondazione Lombarda Antiusura and Fondazione
Welfare Ambrosiano. The initiative entails supporting microfinance initiatives of a social nature, to provide income
support for families, and those of a business nature, for the creation of micro and small enterprises. The catchment
area is essentially the Milan area, and Intesa Sanpaolo is one of the four financial partners involved.

Lastly, there are a few other ongoing agreements for the credit inclusion of disadvantaged persons or small
businesses. These include agreements once again with Fondazione Lombarda Antiusura (in collaboration with
Caritas Ambrosiana and Fondazione Cariplo), with Finetica Onlus, and with NEETwork to offer free training
placements provided by non-profit organisations, as well as with Adiconsum, Exodus 94, Fondazione San Nicola
Medici, Fondazione Antiusura Cavalla, Fondazione Moscati and Fondazione San Matteo for anti-usury initiatives.
In addition to partnerships, the Bank makes available "Finanziamento Microcredito Imprenditoriale" ("Business
microcredit financing"), dedicated to micro-enterprises in the start-up phase of a new business or when investing in
growth projects, enabling them to access credit even without collateral. This opportunity was made possible by a
special section of the SME Guarantee Fund (Ministry of Economic Development Fund, operational since 2000). The
medium/long-term loan, with a maximum duration of 7 years and a maximum amount of 25,000 euro, is designed
for the purchase of goods (including raw materials) or key business services (including lease payments), to pay
for salaries to new employees or working partners, or to pay for training courses to improve professional quality
and technical and managerial skills. Some of the essential characteristics of Business Microcredit Financing are
assistance and monitoring services that support the business, offered free of charge by the VOBIS association
(Volontari Bancari per le Iniziative nel Sociale, an association of volunteer former bank employees that operates
throughout Italy and is purely focused on social solidarity). In 2019, about 700 loans were disbursed for a total of
14.8 million euro.

 

FUNDS FOR IMPACT — NEW CREDIT ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES

Following the guidelines contained in the 2018-2021 Business Plan, the Fund for Impact was launched with
funds of 250 million euro to support the disbursement of around 1.25 billion euro of loans to groups that would
otherwise find it difficult to access credit, despite their potential.

The Fund for Impact is based on the experience of Banca Prossima, now integrated in the Impact Department
of Banca dei Territori di Intesa Sanpaolo, which has introduced this method of intervention to support the non-
profit sector.

In ten months of 2019, the commitment took concrete form with the launch of the "per Merito" initiative, loans
for students in any economic and social condition residing in Italy to access Italian and foreign universities or
master’s degrees without requiring personal or family guarantees. The loan application is made online, with
an increasing credit facility as long as students complete at least 20 credits or 80% of the exams scheduled
