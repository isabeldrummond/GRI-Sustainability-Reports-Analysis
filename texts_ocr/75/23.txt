on 124 start-ups (235 since 2018) which were presented to 850 selected
investors and other ecosystem players (around 1,600 since 2018); 293
applications were obtained, including 49 Italian start-ups in the Techstars
acceleration programme; 100 million euro was allocated to direct
investments through Neva Finventures and the equity crowdfunding
platform BackToWork24 (owned by Neva) through which over 7.2 million
euro was channelled in 2019;

ecosystems and 26 national and international events.

41 innovation projects amounting to over 41 million euro were financed

Through the Innovfin guarantee, issued by the EIF with EU financial

support, around 58 million euro was disbursed to 38 loans in 2019.

Inclusion and diversity management (see page 117)

Projects were launched to encourage the inclusion of people with
intellectual disabilities, in particular people with Down syndrome (2 people
already included) and people diagnosed with autism or autism spectrum
disorder.

In 2019 most members of the inter-functional working group on disability
management attended the “Disability Manager e mondo del lavoro”
(Disability Manager and the working world) higher education course
organised by Cattolica University of Milan, thereby attaining the Disability
Manager certification by the Lombardy Region.

The commitment on the dyslexia front also continued: Intesa Sanpaolo
was Italy's first Dyslexia Friendly certified bank in December 2018.
Assessment and incentive systems (see page 115)

The adoption of the system to map organisational managerial positions in
the company called Global Banding was consolidated, including through
the adoption of an international Title valid for managerial positions in Italy
and abroad.

18 exhibitions organised with over 560,000 visitors; around 80,000
students participated in free educational activities; 230 masterpieces were
lent to Italian and international museums, and over 100 art historians are

suspension programmes for mortgages on affected properties totalling
0.8 billion euro and subsidised loans amounting to over 135 million euro
(approximately 335 million euro since 2018).
