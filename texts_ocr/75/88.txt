The creation of Eurizon Real Asset SGR, a joint venture between Eurizon and Intesa Sanpaolo's Insurance
Division, was part of the implementation of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group's 2018-2021 Business Plan at the
end of 2019, aimed at enhancing expertise in the market of alternative private market investments in
support of the real economy for the direct benefit of companies.

To strengthen its control over the sustainability of its investments, Eurizon is assisted by its internal
Sustainable and Responsible Investments (SRI) Committee (within the SGR and chaired by the CEO)
and the Sustainability Committee (an autonomous and independent body that helps with the management
of Ethical Funds and performs a supporting role). The SRI Committee, set up in 2017, supports the Chief
Executive Officer in setting out ESG-related proposals to present to the Board of Directors by monitoring
the exposure of assets in relation to the relative assessment indicators identified, and overseeing the
escalation process relating to the securities of critical issuers. As well as the Chief Executive Officer, the
Heads of the Investments Department, the Heads of the Control Functions, and the ESG and Strategic
Activism, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Heads also sit on the Committee.

The Sustainability Committee was set up in compliance with the provisions of the Regulation on managing
open-ended mutual investment funds belonging to the Ethics System, and is composed of external persons
of recognised probity and morality. It is responsible for periodically monitoring the investment choices of
the ethical funds and the management strategy adopted by these funds during the reference period. If it
comes to light that fund managers have diverged from the guidelines of the Committee, the Committee
can make a request Eurizon to provide a detailed justification for the investment decisions taken. It then
establishes guidelines for the methods of donating the proceeds from the Ethical System funds to social
projects. In December, the Board of Directors of Eurizon approved the donation of 150,000 euro, of which
134,000 euro already donated to 16 worthwhile associations/entities/social organisations.

Eurizon Capital SGR has adopted a method for the selection of financial instruments that takes into
account environmental, social and governance factors as an integral part of the investment process, aimed
at curbing risks, including those of a reputational nature, and creating value for its customers' portfolios.
The ESG and SRI principles are applied to all actively managed funds, whether they are benchmark or
flexible ones (in contrast ESG criteria are not applied to passive/indexed products or investment solutions
such as, for example, funds of funds, retail portfolio management and specific institutional mandates).

In terms of actively managed funds, specialised ESG products were made which use a proprietary rating
platform to select securities based on their sustainability rating. Active management products also include
ethical funds with dedicated benchmarks.

The process of selecting and monitoring investments based on ESG and SRI principles carried out by the
asset management company is structured on the basis of three phases:

* creation, by the Long-Term Sustainable Strategies office of the Investments Department, of a list of issuers
with high exposure to ESG risks (critical issuers) and a list of issuers operating in sectors regarded as not
socially responsible;

* sharing and verification of these lists with the Investments Department and the SRI Committee;

* monitoring of the observance (ex ante during the order preparation phase and ex post during the portfolio
optimisation phase) of specific operating limits on investments in issuers operating in non-socially responsible
sectors by the Compliance Department.

Operating limits are set in various ways with the following specifications:

« for products whose investment policy is characterised by the presence of a benchmark, the maximum direct
investment allowed is equal to the weight of the issuer in the benchmark;

« for products whose investment policy does not provide for the presence of a benchmark, direct investment in
securities of issuing bodies belonging to the list is ruled out.

With particular reference to the list of critical issuers, the SRI Committee of the asset management
company coordinates and implements an engagement process, i.e. an active share ownership procedure
formulated and enacted at various levels, from dialogue with the companies subject to scrutiny through to
the activation of voting rights at shareholders’ meetings. It is implemented differently for:

« securities already in the portfolio. An 18-month observation period begins upon the activation of the
engagement process to assess whether the issuer should be removed from the critical issuer list, after
which time - in the event of a negative outcome - the process of the disinvestment of assets under
management begins, according to timeframes that fit with the interests of the customer and, in any case,
within three months of the decision;

« securities invested in for the first time (new securities). Purchases are conditional on the drafting of an
Investment Case subject to the prior analysis of the SRI Committee, the results of which are presented to
the Board of Directors for approval.
