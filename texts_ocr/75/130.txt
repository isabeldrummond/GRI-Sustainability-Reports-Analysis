CERTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Intesa Sanpaolo is the first Italian bank to have adopted an Integrated Management System in Italy that complies
with international standards ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety), ISO 14001 (Environment) and ISO
50001 (Energy). The certification scope, for the three schemes, has been extended over the years to include
100% of branches and buildings in Italy in 2019. The System, with particular reference to environmental and
energy issues, establishes a continuous monitoring process of the targets and internal checks are carried out
in order to assess the level of performance achieved compared to planned performance. In order to guarantee
the continued suitability of the measures adopted over time, a system of controls has been defined on three
levels, which involves conducting checks on a representative sample of branches and buildings and on the
activities carried out at head office departments. The first two levels of control are performed by internal company
functions, while third one is entrusted to an external body that certifies the conformity of the System and issues
the certification on the scope of application. In the application of the System on such a complex scope in terms
of territorial extension and heterogeneity of the sites (branch models, dimensions, plants, etc.) and with a view
to continuous improvement, the collaboration between the Safety and Protection Head Office Department,
responsible for the coordination of the System, with various Head Office Departments (Real Estate and Logistics,
Development Policy and Learning Academy, IT) and the Banca dei Territori Division has intensified over the
years. The improvement of risk monitoring and the management of the opportunities that emerged from the
dialogue with the stakeholders allow the System to meet the latter's expectations, which are increasingly focused
on non-financial issues, including environmental ones. The leadership exercised by the Top Management is
crucial in the identification of objectives and strategies and of the necessary resources for the development and
application of the System and in the definition of the internal and external communication plan - issues addressed
in the annual review meeting, in which all the corporate functions involved participate.

In 2019 the certification process in compliance with the ISO 14001 standard was also extended to Intesa Sanpaolo
Vita, a Group company specialised in the insurance segment. The activity involved the Milan office in 2019 and
the extension to two other buildings of the Insurance Division is scheduled by 2020 in Turin and Rome.

CIB Bank (Hungary) has also maintained its premises and services certification in compliance with the ISO 50001
standard. In December 2019, the Bank passed the audit process focused on employee training, compliance with
regulations, internal processes and energy management within the branches, thus obtaining the renewal of the
certification.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION

The mitigation and containment of CO, emissions play an important role in the policies of the Group which, with

the Climate Change Action Plan, has identified specific medium-term actions for reducing its environmental

footprint and, as a result, its emissions. This is done with a view to continually improving its environmental

performance, which has already seen major reductions in electricity and thermal energy consumption, and in

the resulting emissions for over a decade (-53.6% reduction in Scope1 + Scope2 Market-based emissions

compared to 2008).

In 2019 the Intesa Sanpaolo Group confirmed its commitment to reducing its environmental footprint. After an

increase in 2018 also due to the extension of the reporting scope, in 2019 the consumption of electricity and

thermal energy decreased by 6.9% and 18.2% respectively.

Consequently, Scope1 + Scope2 Market-based greenhouse gas emissions also decreased by 21.4%, a

reduction equal to 11.8% in the case of Scope1 + Scope2 calculated with the Location-based method.

In general, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group’s greenhouse gas emissions are reported in CO, equivalent in

accordance with the international GHG Protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol), in the form of:

* Scope direct emissions, relating to the use of fuel for heating and the fleet;

* Scope2 indirect emissions for centralized HVAC systems and electricity;

« Scope3 indirect emissions produced as a result of activities connected with the company but not directly
controlled by it (paper, waste, office equipment, etc.).

EFFICIENCY AND OPTIMISATION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION

In accordance with what has been outlined above, the reduction in energy consumption in 2019 was due in part
to the downsizing of some properties but above all to the continuous energy efficiency actions implemented
within the Intesa Sanpaolo Group both in Italy and abroad.

Below are some of the initiatives that led to savings in 2019:
