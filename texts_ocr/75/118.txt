COMPANY POLICIES

In terms of relationships with its employees, the Intesa Sanpaolo Code of Ethics promotes policies
that help foster a better work-life balance; the concrete implementation of this principle takes the form
of specific rules in the area of reconciliation. Welfare is a priority area with actions designed to foster
motivation and involvement, placing people at the centre with the aim of meeting their needs and those
of their families. Accordingly, the meetings between the company and the Trade Unions have often
centred on policies to strengthen and fine-tune the instruments that make up the company’s welfare
package and significantly contribute to improving the work-life balance of employees and, as such, also
their well-being. Well-being that is also protected through the safeguarding of health and safety in the
workplace via increasingly effective measures, as outlined in the Group’s Health and Safety Policy and
Code of Ethics. The internal regulations establish a System of Roles and Responsibilities - in the shape
of company rules and operating guidelines affecting many different parties - with regard to particular
professional skills, i.e. specific company departments.

WELFARE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE COMPANY

Intesa Sanpaolo has chosen a corporate welfare model that operates within an integrated system and includes:
the supplementary pension, supplementary health care, the cultural, recreation and sports Association for Intesa
Sanpaolo Group employees (ALI) and the Intesa Sanpaolo Foundation NPO, as well as Mobility management
activities (see page 133) and activities focused on the needs of people and work-life balance. The company
welfare system seeks to address the key issues in order to establish the best possible work-life balance for
employees and their families. It does this by promoting sustainable solutions and projects consistent with their
expectations. The activities are managed and monitored by the Trade Union Affairs and Labour Policies Head
Office Department.

Introduced at the end of 2015, the Flexible Work project continued in 2019, also in light of the new Business
Plan objective of extending the initiative to around 24,000 people in 2021, involving an increasing number of
structures and people across the Group (over 17,250 employees) and offering the possibility of working from
home, from different company sites and from customer premises or to carry out flexible training at home. In
the international subsidiary banks the target population consists of over 3,500 employees: around 550 at
Banca Intesa Beograd, 200 at Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania (fully operational since 2019), 900 at CIB Bank
and 1,900 at VUB Banka. In 2019 VUB Banka and Intesa Sanpaolo Bank in Slovenia also introduced forms of
flexitime as additional work-life balance measures.

 

Another innovative tool is the Time Bank, a reserve of time made available by the company and employees so
they can provide greater support for people in difficulty, even for brief periods, and give them more time. It is
also an initiative that appeals to our generosity and spirit of solidarity because, in addition to the hours made
available by the company, with an initial reserve of 50,000 hours, every person has the possibility of donating
