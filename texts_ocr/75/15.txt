The persisting complexity of the macroeconomic environment and the marked volatility of financial markets call
for constant control of the factors enabling the Group to pursue sustainable profitability: high liquidity, funding
capacity, low leverage, adequate capital base and prudent asset valuations.

Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), also adopted as internal liquidity risk measurement
metrics, had reached a level well above fully phased-in minimum requirements provided for by the regulations.

in December 2018), of which 118 billion euro, net of haircut, was unencumbered (89 billion euro at the end of
December 2018). The Loan to Deposit Ratio at the end of 2019, calculated as the ratio of loans to customers
to direct deposits from banking business, stood at 93%.

In terms of funding, the widespread branch network remains a stable, reliable source: 80% of direct deposits
from banking business come from retail operations (338 billion euro). In addition, the following were placed
during the year: 1 billion euro of covered bonds, 13.2 billion Yen of unsecured senior Tokyo Pro-Bonds, 3.50

partial repayment of 29 billion euro of the amount received in the previous TLTRO II (equal to 60.5 billion).
The Intesa Sanpaolo Group’s leverage ratio was 6.7% as at 31 December 2019.
