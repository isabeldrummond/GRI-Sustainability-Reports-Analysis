Responsible asset management and customer protection

COMPANY POLICIES

Asset management and the insurance coverage of customers are central to the activities of the Intesa
Sanpaolo Group, and are ensured through organisational structures in business areas specialising in
asset management, private banking and protection requirements with financial and insurance products
and services. Based on the response to the customers’ portfolio diversification requests on the basis of
their needs (expenses, reserves, investments, pensions and protection) and specific goals in terms of
the effective allocation of resources, the product and service range offered was gradually expanded from
financial management and consultancy to the area of protection, which concerns all customers, from small
to large assets, and from SMEs to large companies, with the due adjustment of the guarantees. The activity
is therefore aimed at the development of financial and insurance products and advisory services to meet
the welfare and protection needs of households and businesses, including in the long term. Guidelines and
Rules for the marketing of financial and insurance products clearly explain the obligation of operators to
act in a transparent, fair and diligent way in the provision of investment services, as required by applicable
legislation as well.

In the Group's Code of Ethics, as regards the principles of conduct towards customers, asset management's
focus is to increasingly highlight social, environmental and good corporate governance criteria in investment
assessments in order to promote balanced and sustainable development. With this in mind, the portfolio offered
includes funds that apply selection criteria in compliance with the Principles for Responsible Investment,
also with the aim of introducing sustainability dynamics in businesses and in customer choices. Eurizon
Capital has also signed up to the Italian Stewardship Principles, which define the procedures for exercising
administrative and voting rights in listed companies, in order to stimulate discussion and cooperation about
social and environmental sustainability issues with listed issuers that the company invests in. As of 2018
Eurizon has its own Engagement Policy in which it reaffirms its commitment to carry out in-depth research
and to establish a fruitful dialogue with the management and/or control bodies of the relevant issuers.
Describing itselfin the 2018-2021 Business Plan as the leading Wealth Management and Protection company
in Italy and Europe, and in its role as bank and insurance company, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group seeks to be a
partner that is able to manage all of the assets and risks of households and businesses through a structured
array of family welfare solutions and targeted insurance policies, also including protection products as
pension saving, business continuity and corporate welfare choices.

In 2019, as part of a more general process of integration of sustainability into business logic and strategies,
the Intesa Sanpaolo Vita Insurance Group joined the PSI (Principles for Sustainable Insurance) promoted by
the United Nations.
