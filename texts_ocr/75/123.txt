at the end of 2019. As part of these trials the possible specific methodologies for assessing the workplaces
and spaces typical of the 4.0 environment, i.e. places different from the workspace normally assigned to each
employee, were examined. These alternative spaces, inside and outside the bank, can be used thanks to
technologies that facilitate collaboration independently of the place in which they are located. A new medical
check-up protocol was identified to include methodologies aimed at examining symptoms that can also be
connected with emerging risks. Finally, changes were made to the methods of evaluating work-related stress,
taking account of new phenomena like technostress. The project and its results were illustrated in the Risk
Assessment Document at the end of 2019.

CHALLENGE - INTERACTION BETWEEN HUMANS AND COMPUTERS AND IMPLEMENTATION
OF NEW APPLICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES

The investigation (Challenge) carried out with Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center Lab Neuroscience and
IMT School for Advanced Studies of Lucca examined interactions between humans and computers to study
how technologies and applications impact on people’s stress levels, and cognitive load, technostress and
ageing in particular, verifying the effectiveness of strategic measures to improve the adaptability and quality
of life of workers in relation to these three aforementioned variables. The study collated and examined: i)
demographic and descriptive variables such as age, gender, qualification, profession, years of service in
the company; ii) psychological variables like cognitive flexibility, mental openness, technostress, subjective
perception of performance and the application, ability to manage cognitive load. The analysis showed
how specific knowledge supported by test data, variables capable of impacting on the phenomena of
technostress and ageing, enables the development and implementation of targeted strategies such as, for
example, strengthening self-efficiency, creating awareness, increasing cognitive flexibility and the optimal
management of IT instruments. The neurophysiological analysis of the sample of volunteers was not
aimed at revealing pathological states but at analysing a momentary reaction of the subject to a specific
task with the use of company applications. The neurophysiological data collected and analysed proved to
be fully in line with that of the general population.

Together with INAIL, Intesa Sanpaolo participated in the international research project “Adaptation and change:
the future of work at a time of technological innovation and the lengthening of the working life”, involving the
qualified physicians and employees of the Banca dei Territori Division and the Head Office departments. The
project involved a medical check-up (voluntary or as part of the health surveillance protocol) during which
specific questionnaires were issued in order to assess work ability in relation to change and ageing. The
project involved 3,154 people (758 from the new concept branches, 319 from traditional branches and 2,077
from the Head Office departments). According to the results of the survey, the Work Ability Index of employees,
i.e. their ability to perform their jobs in the present and future on the basis of their role and resources, was
medium to high.
