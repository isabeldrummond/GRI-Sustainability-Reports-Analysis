EVENTS AND INITIATIVES

In order to raise the awareness of environmental issues among customers and employees, the Intesa Sanpaolo
Group participates in various initiatives aimed at increasingly spreading the culture of sustainability and good
practices as widely as possible. The main international events in which the Group participated in 2019 were the
World Environment Day promoted by UNEP (the United Nations Environment Programme) - whose themes this
year were atmospheric pollution and climate crisis and the European Week for Waste Reduction, promoted by
the European Commission, whose 2019 edition centred around Education on waste reduction and saw increased
participation from the International Subsidiary Banks. In Italy, Intesa Sanpaolo also took part in the Energy Saving
Day (part of the “M'illumino di meno” campaign) while some International Subsidiary Banks, namely CIB Bank
(Hungary) and Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania participated in the WWF's Earth Hour and Bank of Alexandria
(Egypt) celebrated the United Nations Earth Day.

The Museo del Risparmio (Savings Museum), together with the European Investment Bank Institute and Scania
Italia, promotes SAVE (Sustainability, Action, Travel, Experience, see page 80), a project intended for students
of all levels and age groups. The Discovery Truck takes multimedia courses and playful workshops organised
by the Museo del Risparmio around the schools of Italy, dealing with the theme of scarcity of resources, whether
natural or financial, with the aim of making people reflect on the importance of engaging in the fight against waste.
A gift is given to the classes taking part in the project: a cocoa tree. The plants will then build the SAVE Forest,
a plantation of 250 cocoa trees in Cameroon which will absorb 13,750 kg of CO, annually and will constitute a
source of income for farmers. The tree will be geolocated by quantifying the amount of CO, captured.

In relation to the International Subsidiary Banks, in 2019, for the first time, an action to offset CO, emissions was
determined on the occasion of "Novathon", an event promoted since 2016 on an annual basis, dedicated to the
theme of innovation and technologies for the banking sector. The fourth edition involved high-level speakers
and over 1,500 participants in a conference hosted in the Hungarian capital by CIB Bank (Hungary). Over 500
indigenous fruit trees will be planted by 2020 against around 122 tonnes of CO, emitted concurrently with the
event.

Also with a view to raising awareness among the community on environmental issues, among others, Intesa
Sanpaolo promoted the "Dopo la tempesta Vaia — Insieme per la rinascita dei boschi" project, aimed at contributing
to the regrowth of the forests hit by the storm in autumn 2018, with a national fundraising campaign through the
Group's crowdfunding platform, For Funding. The project's overall goal is to raise 150 thousand euro. In support
of the fundraising, the Bank created the "Doniamo un futuro alle nostre foreste" (Let's give a future to our forests)
initiative, which ended in December 2019 and involved children aged between 4 and 12 years. The children were
asked to make a drawing of one of their dreams and upload it, with the help of an adult, to the Bank's website. For
each drawing, Intesa Sanpaolo paid a contribution of 30 euro towards the project. 3,315 drawings were received
for which Intesa Sanpaolo decided to donate the entire credit limit, equal to 120 thousand euro, to the project. The
national campaign will continue until 30 March 2020 (unless extended), with the aim of collecting the 30 thousand
euro needed to reach the final goal. The project will allow the forests destroyed by Vaia to be partly restored by
supporting the pruning and planting works of around 15 hectares in the two-year period 2020-2021 (5 in Veneto,
5 in Friuli-Venezia Giulia and 5 in Trentino-Alto Adige).

The commitment to the environment is testified by another initiative hosted by the For Funding platform. As part
of the “La Notte della Taranta Festival”, the Bank promoted the “Rigeneri...AMO la natura! Project”. The initiative
involved four different oases in southern Italy as part of a development and recovery programme, aimed at
making the beaches free of waste and allowing access for people with disabilities, the elderly and children with
walking difficulties, raising during 2019, through the fundraising promoted on For Funding and via solidarity SMS,
over 146 thousand euro.

During 2019, the Corporate and Investment Banking Division and Banca IMI also organised events and
sponsorships related to green subjects; notably, Development of the green, social and sustainability bond market,
organised together with Icma and Assiom Forex. The event was an opportunity to draw the attention of the
financial community to the progress of the implementation of the EU Action Plan for sustainable finance, the role
of central banks, supervisory authorities and the financial system for the transition to a sustainable and circular
economy and the role of Green Social and Sustainability Bonds as tools to promote the transformation towards
a more sustainable economic model.
