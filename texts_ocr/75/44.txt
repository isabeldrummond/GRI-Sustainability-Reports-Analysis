MANAGEMENT OF ESG AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS IN BUSINESS OPERATIONS

The Code of Ethics requires investment decisions and the credit policy to take into account the socio-environmental
risks associated with the activities of corporate customers. This commitment is also contained in the Rules for the
environmental and energy policy and in the Principles on Human Rights.

The assessment of creditworthiness, which includes the socio-environmental aspects, is conducted for all corporate
customers, in accordance with the Rules of the Internal Rating System.

In particular, thanks to its long-term collaboration with Confindustria Piccola Industria, an innovative rating model has
been developed, validated by the ECB. In the model, social and environmental aspects can also have a positive impact,
leading to an improvement in the rating. In addition to the usual economic and financial assessments, the new model
aims to make it easier to access credit, with more favourable financial terms, by highlighting the intangible qualities
of the business, such as trademarks, patents, quality and environmental certifications, research and development
activities, innovation and digitalisation, development and competitive positioning projects, management of business
risk and being part of a supply chain.

Moreover, a study was launched in the third quarter of 2019 to assess the degree of correlation between the risk
factors usually considered in ESG-type assessments and credit risk. On the basis of the evidence that will emerge
at the end of the analysis, the most appropriate way of introducing these factors into the bank's risk management
processes will be assessed (e.g. creditworthiness assessment).

Within the above mentioned Reputational Risk Management (RRM) processes coordinated by the Chief Risk
Officer Governance Area, Reputational Risk Clearing is particularly important, aimed at the ex-ante identification and
assessment of the potential reputational risks associated with the most significant business operations, the main
capital budget projects and the selection of the Group’s suppliers/partners.

As part of Reputational Risk Clearing, a class of risk is assigned to transactions/counterparties that are potentially
exposed to reputational and ESG risks in order to support decision-making processes, thus enabling an informed
acceptance of risk.

In 2019, clearing activities were further strengthened through:

« the introduction of a category dedicated to assessing the ESG risk profiles of transactions in sensitive sectors
as part of the Group's Most Significant Transactions;

« the incorporation of reputational and ESG assessments into the credit process;

« the inclusion of the assessment of transactions subject to Equator Principles (EP) in the "Reputational Risk
Clearing" process.

With regard to the assessment of business transactions, methodological developments have focused on strengthening
the structural assessment of ESG risks associated with transactions/counterparties, with a particular focus on
customers/counterparties operating in sectors that are also sensitive to climate change risk. In 2019, a total of 40
partnerships and 130 financing transactions were assessed, 17 of which were screened under the Equator Principles
(EP).

The assessment of the transactions subject to EPs, which Intesa Sanpaolo has adhered to since 2007, has been
included in the risk management framework where it contributes to more effectively outlining the risk of the loans
subject to assessment, meeting the objective of making risk management increasingly integrated.

The implementation process of the EPs is also fully integrated with the Group’s credit policies in order to identify all
loans, starting from the application stage, that come under the scope of the Principles. The latter includes the technical
form of Project Finance, from 10 million US dollars, and Project related Corporate Loans, from 100 million US dollars.

The EPs envisage the assignment of a risk category to the projects to be financed (A is high, B medium and C
low), based on variables such as the socio-environmental characteristics of the country, the industrial sector and the
characteristics of the project in question.

Higher-risk projects, and medium-risk projects if necessary, are assessed by an independent advisor who identifies the
main social and environmental impacts.

2019 saw the EP Association's launch of the new EP IV, which will come into force in July 2020 and which extend the
scope of application to refinancing loans and acquisition loans, while the threshold is lowered to 50 million US dollars
for project related corporate loans. Intesa Sanpaolo has actively participated in the review process by providing its
contribution together with the other members of the Association.

In 2019, a total of 11 loans subject to screening according to the Equator Principles reached financial close (a total of
357 since 2007).
In 2019, the amount granted for projects that adopted the Equator Principles assessment process, was 825 million

euro. The amount disbursed during the year for transactions subject to EP screening have been equal to 5.7% of total
disbursement related to project finance transactions.
