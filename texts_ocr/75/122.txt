HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Safety and Protection Department is responsible within the Group for overseeing health and safety
activities. Intesa Sanpaolo has adopted and successfully implemented an Occupational Health and Safety
Management System identifying, within its organisational structure, responsibilities, procedures, processes
and resources for implementing its policy on the protection of employees. With the aim of enhancing the
health and safety protection of its employees, since 2017 the Occupational Health and Safety Management
System has undergone an annual audit by an independent third party which certifies its compliance with
current legislation and industry standards (UNI ISO 45001:2018). The responsibilities and methods associated
with the implementation, maintenance, monitoring and improvement of the Occupational Health and Safety
Management System (OHSMS) are outlined in the Process Guide - Compliance Management - Management
of Occupational Safety Regulations, updated in 2018. The Guide was produced with the goal of reducing the
possibility of any harmful event occurring that impacts people, the environment and relevant external parties,
monitoring risks in the operations of the company and external businesses involved in the company’s activities,
and gradually improving the Group’s performance in occupational health and safety. The risks to the health and
safety of employees are evaluated according to a multidisciplinary approach, considering the combined effect
of the working environment, processes and equipment as well as the subjective conditions of workers The
health and safety risk management process comprises the following phases:

« identification of dangers and their classification;

« risk assessment;

« identification and preparation of prevention and protection measures and procedures;

* definition of an action plan as part of a programme to guarantee the improvement of safety levels over time,
with the identification of the competent company structures;

« realisation of the planned measures as part of the programme;

* definition of worker information and training programmes;

* monitoring of the implementation of the programmes and checks on the application and effectiveness of the
measures adopted;

* management of residual risks.

Intesa Sanpaolo (as Employer) — with the collaboration of the Head of the Prevention and Protection Service
and the Qualified Physicians and following the consultation of the Workers’ Representatives in charge of
Safety - drafts and updates the Risk Assessment Document which contains, among other things:

« the report on the assessment of all health and safety risks during working activities, which also specifies the
criteria adopted for the assessment;
« specification of the prevention and protection measures implemented and the individual protection equipment
adopted following the assessment;
* the programme of measures regarded as suitable for guaranteeing an improvement in safety levels over
time;
* an outline of the procedures for the implementation of the measures, as well as the company roles responsible
for this.
The assessment and the associated document are updated on the basis of technical developments as well
as significant changes to the production process and organisational structure of the company that may
impact on the risk exposure of workers. This commitment was fulfilled in 2019 as well, with the updated
document provided to all employees. In 2019, the risk management process at the Group’s sites, implemented
in close collaboration with the competent company functions, was carried out according to an action plan
that made it possible to maintain the trend of the overall reduction in risk factors. The post-traumatic stress
support programme continued in 2019. As in previous years, this support is provided to employees who have
experienced robberies, acts of verbal or physical violence or natural disasters, or been involved in traumatic
events connected with the working environment. Medical and psychological support, consistent with the
seriousness of the trauma suffered, was offered to all employees involved in the incidents brought to the
attention of the Prevention and Protection Service. In 2019 a total of 28 support actions were organised
involving around 217 employees (in detail: 11 actions following robberies for 73 employees, 17 actions following
traumatic events for 144 employees).

As part of the 2018-2021 Business Plan, the Occupational Health and Safety 4.0 Project was launched in 2018
to analyse the development of banking activities in relation to the digitalisation of processes and therefore to
understand the effects on the health and wellbeing of the company population. The project is also based on
contextual elements such as the gradual aging of the workforce, anticipating future scenarios and working
methods in order to develop, with medical support, risk mitigation measures in the layout of new workstations
and in the content of programmes and procedures designed to guide the new activities. The project involves
6 working groups; a first phase to identify specific new survey methodologies and trial them was completed
