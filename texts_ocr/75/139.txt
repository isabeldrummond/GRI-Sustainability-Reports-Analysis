Out of a total of around 250 applications reviewed since the launch of the credit plafond, 63 projects were funded
for a value of around 760 million euro at the end of 2019. Numerous company projects were supported for
initiatives such as the replacement of traditional materials with others from recycled or biological sources, the
recovery of urban organic waste for biomethane production, with the production of compost and recovery of CO,,
the production of coloured compostable fabrics with dyes made from agricultural waste.

In order to disseminate and share these criteria within the Bank, an online training course was set up and made
available to over 50,000 Group employees.

Furthermore, during 2019 several training and awareness-raising initiatives took place: 120 future managers of
the Bank were trained on Circular Economy issues within the Talent Program; 400 employees took advantage of
specific courses; 10 training modules were published online in “Scuola dei Capi” as well as 4 Circular Economy
Podcasts; 600 students were involved in circular lectures.

During the year, the circular assessment of businesses along their value chain also continued (around 100
businesses were interviewed) through the use of the Circular Economy Standard, an instrument used to measure
the level of circularity.

In 2019, with regards to start-ups (see page 86), the Start-Up Initiative continued, which selects the most
promising innovative start-ups, prepares them to face the market with coaching initiatives, and introduces them
to the players of the innovation ecosystem. The selection process was integrated together with the circularity
criteria in the overall assessment. Two Italian start-ups in the bioeconomy and fashion sectors were awarded as
Circular Economy success stories.

In the context of partnerships and collaborations, meetings of the Alleanza Italiana per Economia Circolare
(Italian Alliance for the Circular Economy), of which Intesa Sanpaolo is the promoter, together with Enel, also
continued. The Alliance comprises a number of large and medium sized ‘Made in Italy' companies and, since
2017, has sought to reinforce existing collaborations and propose new projects between companies, in order to
promote the transition to the Circular Economy in the various production chains, while also involving Italian and
European institutions.

To spread the culture of innovation in the area of Circular Economy, the Group continued to provide support to
the BioCircE Master (the first Italian Master’s qualification in this area).

An implementation agreement was entered into with Bocconi University, within the scope of a three-year
framework agreement, for research activities in the context of the Circular Economy in order to validate the
de-risking theory of financial portfolios, both at the individual counterparty level and at the portfolio level. The
Circular Economy and Finance research, which took place in 2019, began to scientifically investigate this issue
by focusing on some of the opportunities offered in terms of de-risking circular assets, generating superior risk-
return combinations and the ability to stabilise performance over time.

As part of the work, the 3R (Risk, Revenue, Reputation) Model was defined, a mapping of the main benefits
generated for financial institutions by the Circular Economy.

As part of the European Commission initiatives, Intesa Sanpaolo has continued the activity initiated in 2017, by
participating regularly in the work of the Group of Experts for the financing of the Circular Economy, contributing
to the publication in 2019 of the document Accelerating the transition to the Circular Economy which defines
the guidelines to improve access to financial products dedicated to the Circular Economy. Moreover, the Group
participated in the consultation of the Italian Ministry of the Environment and the Protection of Land and Sea
(MATTM) on indicators for the measurement of the Circular Economy and in the work of the National Observatory
on Sustainable Finance promoted by the MATTM.

In addition, the Group took part in the work of 'FinanCE’, a working group formed within the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation network, with the aim of rethinking the financial sector to accelerate the transition to the Circular
Economy, by identifying concrete measures which the public and private sectors should undertake.

GREEN BOND

In 2017, Intesa Sanpaolo was the first Italian bank to issue a 500-million-euro Green Bond connected with
environmental sustainability projects.

The commitments undertaken by Intesa Sanpaolo are defined within Guidelines (Green Bond Framework) in line
with the Green Bond Principles of the ICMA (International Capital Markets Association), as verified by an external
ESG research and analysis company.

In June 2019, following its annual reporting commitment, Intesa Sanpaolo published its second Green Bond Report
[i] on the use of Green Bond proceeds and its associated environmental benefits. The report also includes the
certification of the auditing company, the Second Party Opinion on the bond issue (Robust ESG performance) and
the Moody’s assessment, which obtained the highest score (GB1 Excellent).

As of 31 May 2019, the Bond proceeds, fully allocated during the first year of the issue, was used as follows:
61.3% to refinance specific loans included in the portfolio of Intesa Sanpaolo and 38.7% for the financing of new
projects, selected by a dedicated working group. In total, 75 projects were financed with over 353,000 tonnes of CO,
