* In 2019 it was established that the survey channel of reference is the telephone. Therefore, the 2019 NPS is calculated by applying a correction that makes it possible to make the
votes collected through different channels comparable with those gathered by telephone. From 2019 the data referring to customers of the aggregate set of former Banca Popolare
di Vicenza and former Veneto Banca are included.
** Overall monetary contribution to the community is calculated based on the LBG methodology.
