Governance and management of risks ANTI-CORRUPTION 103-2; 205-2; SOCIOECONOMIC COMPLIANCE 103-2; AUDIT 103-3

The Guidelines define the commitment to comply with the regulatory provisions aimed at combating corruption

in all its forms, where corruption means the direct or indirect offering or acceptance of money or other benefits

capable of influencing the recipient, in order to induce or reward the performance of a function/activity, or
alternatively its omission. In line with international best practices, the Group does not tolerate:

* any type of corruption, in any form, manner or jurisdiction, not even if activities of this kind are permitted,
tolerated or not prosecuted under the laws in force in the countries in which the Group operates;

* any conduct involving the offer or acceptance of money or other benefits — directly or indirectly — with the aim
of inducing or rewarding the performance of a function/activity, or alternatively its omission. Such conduct is not
tolerated even with regard to small payments aimed at speeding up, facilitating or ensuring the performance
of a routine activity, or any activity that forms part of the recipient's duties (known as facilitation payments).
Benefits that cannot be granted include, for example, gifts and services offered free of charge (except for those
envisaged by specific regulations on gifts, and entertainment and charitable expenses), the undue hiring of a
person, the granting of credit on terms that do not conform to the principles of sound and prudent management
and, more generally, all transactions that entail the generation of a loss for the Group and the creation of a profit
for the recipient.

Monitoring in this area is assigned to the Anti Financial Crime Head Office Department, and its Manager is
allocated the role of Group Anti-Corruption Officer.

The Anti-Corruption Guidelines have been approved by the main Group companies, including the Banks of
the Banca dei Territori Division, Banca IMI, Fideuram Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking, Intesa Sanpaolo Vita
and Eurizon Capital. Within the scope of the International Subsidiary Banks Division, all banks have submitted
the document for formal acknowledgement to their relevant bodies and have adapted the Guidelines to the
regulatory environment.

In 2019, there were continued checks on the consistency of the detailed internal regulations with the general
principles set out in the Anti-Corruption Guidelines, in order to implement the necessary alignment, in addition to
a detailed analysis of the anti-corruption controls currently in place in the individual “highest risk areas”, in order
to identify any strengthening measures. In particular, the regulations governing the Suppliers List have been
amended, the regulations on non-financial investments, territorial charities and guest houses have been updated
and operations in the social area have been regulated.

Note also that in May 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo was among the first banks in Europe to receive the certificate of
compliance of its anti-bribery management system with UNI ISO 37001 international standards. Issued by a third
party, the certification came at the end of a process of analysis and verification of the Bank's anti-corruption system
and covered all banking and financial operations and services and all other operations that are instrumental or
connected to the achievement of the corporate purpose.

During the year, the Anti Financial Crime Head Office Department processed 228 “advice” and “clearing” files
for specific operations in the highest risk areas, particularly concerning the purchase, management and sale
of equity investments and other assets, donations, sponsorships and relationships with suppliers, the hiring of
personnel, and gifts.

At the end of October 2019, the training course on the Anti-Corruption Guidelines — issued for people of the
Group's Italian companies in 2018 — was made mandatory and expanded to include a specific focus on the UNI
ISO 37001:2016 standard. The same course has been translated into English and also issued to the people of
the foreign branches of Intesa Sanpaolo.

Finally, during 2019 specific classroom training initiatives were held for personnel dedicated to compliance issues
or who work in the areas most exposed to the risk of corruption.

In Italy, there were no cases of disciplinary measures related to corruption incidents.

There were no significant penalties for non-compliance with laws or regulations relating to corruption.

COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING

Intesa Sanpaolo pays particular attention to compliance with national and international regulations aimed
at combating money laundering and terrorist financing, which it recognises as a serious threat to the legal
economy with destabilising effects for the banking system, and it adheres to the principle of active cooperation
in preventing these phenomena.

In compliance with the legislative provisions of the legislator and the sectoral supervisory authorities, and
based on the international standards contained in the FATF (International Financial Action Task Force)
Recommendations, the Group has adopted procedures, instruments and controls designed to mitigate
the risk of being involved, even unknowingly, in acts of money laundering, terrorist financing, violation of
embargoes and arms regulations.

The Group's governance system to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism is based on
