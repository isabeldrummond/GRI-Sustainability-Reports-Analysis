Society

In the cultural programme of the Gallerie d'ltalia, specific attention is paid to special audiences or people
with sensory and cognitive disabilities, foreign communities of immigrants, people living in difficult situations,
maintaining an ongoing commitment to eliminate the physical and mental barriers that can hinder access to
their collections and the art, and to combating social exclusion with a view to serving the community.

In 2019 more than 560,000 visitors were welcomed at the Gallerie d'Italia, including the exhibition space on
the 36th floor of the Turin Skyscraper, about 80,000 children and young people took part free of charge in
educational activities, confirming 100 young art historians working permanently at the Gallerie d'ltalia.

In 2019, 18 exhibitions were organised (10 major exhibitions and 8 dossier exhibitions), hosted in the Gallerie
d'ltalia and the Turin Skyscraper, plus 5 exhibitions organised in different venues (the Italian Cultural Institute
in New York, Palazzo Madama and the Fondazione CAMERA in Turin, the Fondazione Pistoia Musei, and
Palazzo Girifalco di Cortona for the Cortona On The Move Festival).

As part of the three-year cultural partnership agreement signed in 2018 between Intesa Sanpaolo-Gallerie
d'ltalia and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, the major exhibition Canova-Thorvaldsen at the Gallerie
d'ltalia in Milan was held in 2019, enabled by the partnership with the prestigious Russian museum, as well as
the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen.

During the year, 230 works of art from the corporate collections were loaned to exhibitions in Italy (in
prestigious venues such as Palazzo Reale in Milan, Fondazione Giorgio Cini in Venice, Museo e Real Bosco
di Capodimonte in Naples) and abroad.

In 2019, ALMED-Alta Scuola in Media Comunicazione e Spettacolo of the Cattolica University conducted an
innovative International Case Study on Progetto Cultura, a unique study in the European and international
panorama of case studies, which to date do not include other cases focused on the strategic management of
corporate cultural assets.

Intesa Sanpaolo is committed to promoting the art collection at an international level through partnerships with
world-leading cultural institutions, contributing to the promotion of Italian culture across the world.

COMMERCIAL INITIATIVES IN THE COMMUNITY

The promotion of art and culture is a commitment that has always distinguished the work of Intesa Sanpaolo,
in the belief that a major bank must be able to meet the expectations of progress in its own country, not
just economic but also civil, cultural and spiritual, while respecting local identities. Intesa Sanpaolo strives to
respect the Group’s principles and values (ethical, cultural and social) also in its partnership and sponsorship
initiatives, paying particular attention to the selection of projects capable of conveying messages in line with
the image and reputation of the Bank and Group.

Relations between Intesa Sanpaolo and local communities are developed through activities to promote:
culture and knowledge; support for research and innovation to foster new economic and social development
opportunities, with solidarity programmes and initiatives to promote sport; and sustainability as a value for
businesses and a loyalty factor for customers.

The main cultural activities include the promotion of music, theatre, dance, cinema, art, publishing and reading,
and photography, with a particular focus on young people.

To ensure that an increasingly wider public is able to enjoy and appreciate Italy’s artistic and cultural heritage,
the Bank collaborates with leading bodies and institutions.

Some of the most notable partnerships with major Italian theatres include: Teatro alla Scala, Turin’s Teatro
Regio, Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Teatro La Fenice in Venice, Teatro di San Carlo in Naples,
Teatro Comunale of Vicenza, Teatro Comunale in Bologna, Piccolo Teatro, Teatro Franco Parenti, and Teatro
Piemonte Europa. One of the more notable projects is La Scala UNDER30, in collaboration with Teatro alla
Scala, which seeks to get younger generations interested in opera and classical ballet.

Key partnerships with major music, dance and performing arts festivals were also supported: MITO
SettembreMusica International Music Festival, Piano City Milano, the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto,
Puccini Festival, Rossini Opera Festival, TorinoDanza, Torino Jazz Festival, Umbria Jazz and JazzMI, with
around 100 concerts, and featuring big international stars and Italian and European up-and-comers in the
world of jazz. Similarly, support was also offered to the Festival della Taranta which is both an opportunity to
promote the local region and its cultural traditions and a way of focusing attention on social and environmental
issues.

In 2019, Intesa Sanpaolo collaborated once again with artist Roberto Bolle to create On Dance, a cultural week
celebrating dance, with a large festival that took place in some of Milan’s spectacular locales, and Naples as
well, featuring shows, exhibitions, happenings, flash mobs, meetings and workshops.

It continued its long-standing partnership with the FAI (the Italian Environment Fund) on the | Luoghi del Cuore
project, that collects observation reports from the public concerning places of historic and artistic interest
