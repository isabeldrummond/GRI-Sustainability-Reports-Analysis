related investments necessary for the implementation of the initiatives set out in the Master Plan. Some of the
most important initiatives for the Bank are:

« activities aimed at improving customer service (e.g. risk-based authentication — security measures that adapt
to the risk of the transaction) and strengthening internal processes in terms of actions and communications
to be activated in the event of a critical event, in order to reduce the related risks

anti-fraud actions at a Group level, the objective of which is the continuous strengthening of the predictive
model based on the use of data, technology and process knowledge. The expected benefits are manifold,
including improved operational and process efficiency, minimisation of successful attacks and a faster
response to fraud attempts

growth of the Security Monitoring of third parties that provides services to the Bank using its own methodology
for the evaluation, classification and verification of suppliers for IT security and business continuity. The
security checks cover the entire life cycle of the supplier within the Bank, from the contracting phase, during
the provision of the service, to the termination of the contract. A dedicated team set up in 2019 will oversee
this issue.

With regard to the direct protection of customer assets, the Bank constantly updates its anti-fraud system, which
is able to analyse all operations carried out via the digital channels in real time, flagging up any suspicious
ones so they can immediately be checked centrally by a team of experts.

In a context where attempted breaches are constantly growing, Intesa Sanpaolo maintains the level of
effectiveness of its anti-fraud systems year after year. This made it possible to block fraudulent transactions
in 2019 totalling about 46 million euro for retail customers and about 86 million euro for corporate customers.
The IT security profile is also based on the spread of awareness of the risks, of the prevention methods, of the
relevance of the data processed and of the use of the application procedures by all the subjects involved (Bank
structures, employees, customers and suppliers). Particular attention has been paid to customer awareness
of IT security issues by publishing a series of communications on the public website (information pages,
documents and infographics) and on bank statements (used as safe channels), also in collaboration with the
relevant Italian and European authorities. In this regard, by way of example, Intesa Sanpaolo was the only
Italian bank to participate in Europol campaigns (Cyber Scams, Don't Be a Mule, No More Ransom initiatives),
helping with the preparation and distribution of materials designed to increase the knowledge of computer
security culture among customers through examples and direct messages, so that they can maintain control
of their digital lives.

The annual training provided by Intesa Sanpaolo is aimed at all levels of the company's hierarchy, including
Top Management, which in 2019 was involved in various initiatives, including some simulations of crisis
management caused by a cyber/data breach and several workshops on IT security. A number of partnerships
have been established with Bocconi University and the polytechnics of Milan and Turin in order to support the
creation of the first courses in cybersecurity, internships, talent programmes for ethical hackers.

In 2019, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group structures responsible for the collection and analysis of information in
order to technically identify cyber-threats (threat intelligence) intensified their activities for the Group Banks
and companies, as well as for national bodies supporting the credit sector. Initiatives involving Intesa Sanpaolo
in various working groups with international bodies like AFME, BPI, JP Morgan, HSBC, ECSO, Leonardo, EBF,
Enisa and CERTFin and ABILab also continued.

The integrated monitoring of IT security and business continuity as part of crisis management procedures
confirmed the Bank’s effective management of events related to natural disasters and crisis situations, ensuring
the continuity of services and the safeguarding and protection of employees and customers.

Finally, as in previous years, the Bank remains committed to obtaining and maintaining third-party certification
for its security and operational continuity activities that guarantee quality, and also for its appropriate monitoring
of the services it provides (see [i]).
