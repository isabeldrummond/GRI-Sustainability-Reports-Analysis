Governance and management of risks 102-11; 102-29; 201-2

With reference to direct impacts, Intesa Sanpaolo is committed to analysing and containing possible risks on its
properties.

The Risk Assessment Document evaluating risks to workers’ health and safety (Italian Legislative Decree
81/2008) also includes, for example, the assessment of the hydrogeological risk due to flooding and landslides.
A hydrogeological risk assessment of buildings is conducted as a preventive measure in relation to local risk and
building vulnerability, and also subsequent to an external event with a view to maintaining the practical features of
the buildings involved. Based on the provisions of the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research
(ISPRA, Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale), which divides the territory into 5 hazard
classes (very high P4, high P3, medium P2, moderate P1 and attention areas AA), more than 1,000 Intesa Sanpaolo
buildings in Italy are subject to landslide and flood risk. For the Bank’s assessment of flooding, the benchmark is
based on the level of danger associated with a floodable area, and depends on the probability that the area can
be flooded. With regard to landslides, on the other hand, the benchmark is also based on the level of danger (from
P1 to P4) associated with an area subject to landslides, but depends on the relationship between the probability
of occurrence of the event and its magnitude taking into account both the speed of the landslide’s movement and
the extent of its spread over the area. These assessments enable the Intesa Sanpaolo Group in Italy to implement
actions that take account of the effects of critical events linked to natural phenomena attributable to climate change,
allowing for the management of different potential risk scenarios, through the implementation of specific Emergency
Plans, in order to mitigate and reduce possible damage, particularly to workers and third parties.

In addition, in order to improve the intervention and mitigation of hydrogeological risk, a pilot project was recently
launched to define a vulnerability index for the Bank's properties. This index is useful for defining priority criteria
for intervention or in-depth analysis when emergency situations occur. Based on the results of the pilot project,
possible intervention measures to make the buildings safe will then be identified in order to prevent the occurrence
of potential risk situations.

In general, with regard to all direct risks related to climate change and to the occurrence of crisis events in Italy,
the adopted model calls for the activation of CEM (Critical Events Management) at the first alert of bad weather.
CEM guarantees the continuous and precise monitoring of the situation and supports the overall coordination of the
actions agreed to by the territorial structures, in constant connection with the relevant central structures.

In the case of very serious calamitous events, the EMOC (Emergency Management Operations Centre) of the
Business Continuity Management Department is also activated, which monitors the situation, assesses the
temporary closure of buildings and initiates any other actions.

In order to guarantee operational continuity in the areas most affected by bad weather, the local and central
structures’ crisis contacts are also activated for the timely reporting of critical issues, with particular reference to
delays in the transport of valuables and correspondence, staff difficulties in reaching the workplace and difficulties
of the branches with operations and systems.

Finally, with regard to the Environmental and Energy Management System according to the UNI EN ISO 14001:2015
standard, the Background Analysis has been updated to shed light on the needs and expectations of all stakeholders
involved in applying the System, and on the specific associated risks. The update identified four categories of risks
(economic/financial, management, application/operational and reputational/ethical/social).

In general, a “low” level of risk is considered acceptable, whereas for “medium” and “high” level risks, corrective
actions are foreseen within six months and one month respectively, followed by monitoring of their progress. Among
the risks identified and monitored as part of the Context Analysis, the risks associated with failure to comply with
mandatory environmental regulations are also considered.
