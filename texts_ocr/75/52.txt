« internal control system;
* power and delegation system.

The Board of Directors delegates the structures the task of implementing the content of the Model and
ensuring the constant updating and implementation of internal regulations and company processes, which
are an integral part of the Model, in compliance with the principles of control and conduct defined for each
sensitive activity.

The effective and concrete implementation of the Model is also guaranteed by:

« the Surveillance Body, in exercising the powers of initiative and control assigned to it in relation to the
activities carried out by the individual organisational units in sensitive areas;

the heads of the various organisational units of the Bank (Governance Areas, Divisions, Departments
and Organisational Units) in relation to the activities at risk carried out by them. Without prejudice to
the independent responsibility of each Italian-registered company of the Group regarding the adoption
and effective implementation of its own Model, Intesa Sanpaolo in performing its duty as the Parent
Company issues general criteria and instructions, and verifies the compliance of company Models with
those criteria and instructions.

In October 2019, the Board of Directors approved the update of Intesa Sanpaolo’s Model, which takes
account of the evolution of legislation in the following areas:

« Italian Legislative Decree no. 107/2018 which contains the rules for compliance with the provisions of EU
Regulation no. 596/2014 on market abuse;

« Italian Law no. 3/2019 which introduced the new predicate offence of "trafficking in illicit influences"
(art. 346 bis of the Italian Criminal Code) and widened the scope of persons who may be involved in
international corruption offences (art. 322 bis of the Italian Criminal Code);

« Italian Law no. 39/2019 which introduced into Italian Legislative Decree no. 231/01 the offence of "fraud
in sports competitions, abusive gaming or betting" (art. 25 quaterdecies).

Moreover, in addition to the aforementioned regulatory alignments, the Model has been updated with
respect to:

* organisational changes like the merger by incorporation of ISGS into Intesa Sanpaolo and the transfer
of certain credit recovery activities to Intrum Italy;

* new business activities like the concession to third parties (commercial partners) of physical and digital
spaces for the promotion and sale of products (so-called retailisation);

* other adjustments like a change to the causes of suspension and revocation of the members of the
Supervisory Body and the updating of the sensitive activity "Management of Relations with the Supervisory
Authorities" in order to take into account the organisational changes resulting from the establishment of
the ESFS (European System of Financial Supervision).

Following the approval of the new Model by the Parent Company, the other Italian companies of the Group
began the adoption of these updates.

To provide the Surveillance Body with an overall picture of the planning of the various control structure ac-
tivities (compliance, anti-money laundering, administrative/financial governance, internal audit), the Com-
pliance function collects the respective plans from the relevant structures on an annual basis regarding
the scheduled supervision of sensitive areas and incorporates them into the 231 Audit Plan. On the basis
of this document, the Surveillance Body assesses the adequacy of the programme of audits on individual
sensitive company activities and identifies any further actions needed to strengthen the audit plans pro-
posed by the structures concerned.

The heads of the organisational units involved in sensitive processes pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree
231/01 certify the level of implementation of the Model, by means of an overarching self-diagnosis process
on the work carried out, with a particular focus on compliance with the principles of control and conduct
and the operating rules.

Lastly, constant attention is paid to training initiatives and the dissemination of compliance culture: in this
regard, the new remote learning course for the three-year period 2019-2021 has been designed to provide
specific training modules.

The Group's Anti-Corruption Guidelines, approved in 2017 by the Board of Directors, identify the principles and
the sensitive areas and define the roles, responsibilities and macro-processes for the management of this risk,
further strengthening an internal regulatory framework which already consists of the Code of Ethics, the Group
Internal Code of Conduct and — for the Italian Group companies — the Organisational, Management and Control
Model adopted pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001.
