WOMEN’S ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS

The Business Gemma loan supports businesses run by women and self-employed women. While the original
agreement underlying the product signed by ABI, the government and trade associations expired in 2018, the
Bank has maintained the loan which benefits free of charge from the guarantee of the special section of the SME
Fund for Women's Entrepreneurship and allows the Bank to request the suspension of the capital portion of the
instalments for up to 12 months during the amortisation period.

267 loans were disbursed for a total of 10.1 million euro in 2019.

Among International Subsidiary Banks, Banca Intesa Beograd and Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania signed agree-
ments with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) as part of the Women in Business
programme which, in support of micro, small and medium enterprises run by women in the Western Balkans,
has offered subsidised loans, technical consulting and the sharing of know-how for women who benefit from the
initiative. In 2019, Banca Intesa Beograd disbursed 355 loans for more than 3.6 million euro, and Intesa Sanpaolo
Bank Albania, having renewed the programme with a new line of credit of 5 million euro, made available approx-
imately 670 thousand euro for 21 loans to female entrepreneurs.

DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF START-UPS

Start up Initiative [i] is an international acceleration programme of the Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center
dedicated to the most promising innovative companies, preparing them to face the market with coaching
initiatives, and introducing them to players in the innovation ecosystem. The best start-ups are also presented
at specific events (Investor Arena Meetings).

In 2019, 6 acceleration programmes were implemented, of which 124 start-ups (235 from 2018) were presented
to about 850 investors and other players in the ecosystem (about 1,600 from 2018).

In 2018, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Compagnia di San Paolo and Fondazione Cassa
di Risparmio di Torino to pool resources and expertise and define a joint strategic plan on innovation. The
first concrete realisation of this collaboration is the partnership with the American accelerator Techstars, one
of the first in the world, for the exclusive European launch of three acceleration programmes related to Smart
Mobility between 2020 and 2022. The programme lasted 13 weeks and collected 293 applications, 49 of which
were Italian. The start-ups will be guided by about 100 mentors. The 10 start-ups selected at the end of the
programme will receive an investment in equity and potential follow-up in the form of convertible notes.
