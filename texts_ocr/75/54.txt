PUBLIC POLICY 103-2; 415-1 Governance and management of risks

Guidelines that constitute a systematic and functional reference framework, with active collaboration by the
Group in preventing these illegal activities. Specific processes and procedures are in place in the areas
of obligations of customer due diligence, reporting of suspicious transactions, recording of relations and
transactions, storage of documents, risk assessment and management, internal control and guarantee of
compliance with all of the relevant provisions to prevent and impede the completion of transactions connected
to money laundering, the financing of terrorism, violation of embargoes and arms regulations. The guidelines
and standards established by the Parent Company are developed and implemented within the individual
operating structures in accordance with the characteristics and complexity of the activity carried out, as well
as in accordance with their size and organisational structure, in compliance with the requirements of local
regulations and ensuring the sharing of information at a consolidated level.

Procedures that provide automatic checks on the Group's register and transactions have been active for
some time now, in order to mitigate the risk of having customers included in the list of entities subject to
restrictions or freezing of assets (black list). The Group has also adopted a stricter approach, going beyond
the regulatory requirements, by envisaging more detailed assessments of credit and reputational aspects
to prevent its involvement, in any capacity, in transactions with counterparties or countries under embargo,
even if the transaction is among those permitted by the restrictive provisions issued by the international
authorities. 2019 saw the completion of the projects aimed at adapting AML controls to the new regulatory
requirements of the AML IV Directive (transposed by Italian Legislative Decree 90/2017), and in December
the Guidelines were brought into line with the Bank of Italy's 2019 Provisions on organisation, procedures
and internal controls and on customer due diligence. The implementation of the related IT projects is still
ongoing. The activities of the multi-year programme for the overall review and strengthening of anti-money
laundering, embargoes, anti-terrorism and anti-corruption controls at Group level (ENIF Project - Enabling
Integrated Financial Crime) also continued. The complexity of the project suggested that it should be
restructured in order to identify the priorities for implementation for the two-year period 2020-2021 according
to a risk-based logic in terms of geography, processes and customer segments.

RELATIONS WITH POLITICAL PARTIES AND MOVEMENTS

The internal policies establish that political parties and movements cannot be recipients of donations and
sponsorships. With regard to the financing of political parties, connected associations and individual candidates,
specific rules state that the only form of new credit concession for them, that can solely be decided upon by the
Board of Directors, consists of the advance on an annual basis of the "2x1,000 contribution" against the transfer,
to be notified in accordance with the law, of the sums due to the parties for this form of contribution. In 2019 no
financing was granted in this area.

COMPLIANCE WITH TAX REGULATIONS

In compliance with the Code of Ethics, the entire Group is committed to observing principles based on
values of honesty and integrity in managing tax matters, compliance with the tax regulations applicable in the
countries in which the Group operates, and maintaining a collaborative and transparent relationship with the
tax authorities, including through adherence to cooperative compliance schemes.

Intesa Sanpaolo places a particular focus on the evolution of tax regulations, both on a domestic and
international level, aimed at countering base erosion and profit shifting, with the ongoing commitment to
adhere to those principles. The Group has strengthened the internal control system for tax risk, known as the
Tax Control Framework, to make it capable of covering the strategically important area of tax risk and meeting
the requirements for access to the collaborative compliance scheme introduced in Italy, in accordance with
Italian Legislative Decree 128/2015. On 10 December 2018, Intesa Sanpaolo was granted access by the
Italian Revenue Agency to the Cooperative Compliance scheme, starting from 2017 when the application was
submitted. Under this scheme, Intesa Sanpaolo and the Italian Revenue Agency can perform joint assessments
on certain situations that could lead to tax risks thanks to ongoing, preventive contact, with a view to resolving
any potential disputes before they occur.

In December 2017, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group adopted its Principles in relation to tax matters, in order to
ensure compliance with the tax and fiscal rules of the countries where it operates over time, and to guarantee
the financial and reputational integrity of all the Group companies. In particular, guidelines have been
established to ensure uniform management of taxation at all Group companies, based on approach of: (i)
correct and timely determination and payment of taxes due by law and performance of the related obligations,
(ii) containment of tax risk, understood as the risk of operating in violation of tax regulations or in conflict with
