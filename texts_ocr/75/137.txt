the Intesa Sanpaolo Group continued its tangible and concrete commitment to supporting households and
businesses affected with specific focus on agricultural companies which, more than others, are penalised
by exceptional weather events, through the activation of dedicated credit lines, with the provision of new
subsidised loans for restoring damaged structures (homes, shops, offices, artisanal workshops and businesses),
suspensions of payments on outstanding loans and preferential, simplified and expedited procedures for new
instruments. The interventions involved several Italian geographic areas (see page 78).

Intesa Sanpaolo has continued to support non-profit companies that wish to invest in energy efficiency
projects with solutions that make it possible to save on energy costs and increase the overall sustainability
of the company's activity. At the end of 2019, total loans relative to the agreement with Federesco (National
Federation of ECSo’s) came to 1.9 million euro. These initiatives generated savings of around 649 tonnes of
oil equivalent (toe) in 2019, corresponding to around 1,397 tonnes of CO, avoided.

In 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo Group continued to disburse short, medium and long-term loans in support of projects
for renewable energy and energy efficiency works for professionals and businesses.

These include the Finanziamento Energia Imprese (businesses energy loan), which is designed to support
investment plans focused on the development of efficient energy production plants and diversifying energy
sources and/or streamlining consumption, as well as the Finanziamento Energie Rinnovabili (renewable
energy loan), created for the construction of new plants for the production of renewable energies other than
photovoltaic energy, such as biomass and small-scale wind energy.

Since the beginning of 2019, the “Finanziamento Condominio” product has been restyled, providing greater
flexibility, in line with tax incentives (such as Ecobonus and Sismabonus) envisaged for the restructuring of
the condominium common areas, extending its duration up to 10 years. The “Finanziamento Condominio” has
the aim of promoting real estate development, security, but, above all, the energy redevelopment of properties
in Italy. During the year, agreements were entered into with some Energy Service Companies that provide
condominiums with solutions and technical tools for energy efficiency. Once the ideal energy efficiency solution
has been chosen, the condominium will be able to request a loan from Intesa Sanpaolo (up to a maximum
of 80% of the investment) with beneficial conditions, a 50% reduction in application fees and the guarantee
of fixed and short times for the conclusion of the appraisal. In the same context, an agreement was entered
into with Anaci, the main trade association of the Condominium Administrators, with the aim, among others, of
disseminating a culture of eco-sustainability, security and development of properties in Italy.

Intesa Sanpaolo, through former Mediocredito Italiano, continued to support businesses that invest in
renewable energy production plants and in the energy efficiency of their production processes, providing
dedicated financial solutions and specialist advisory services. During the year, loans were granted to support
projects mainly in the photovoltaic, wind, hydroelectric and biomethane sectors in the amount of 115.5 million
euro. All loans, overseen step by step by the specialist Energy Desk, are always preceded by an appraisal in
support of the Bank’s credit assessment. Customers can count on a comprehensive service that ranges from
risk assessment to the structuring of the most appropriate financial solutions, and from consultancy on new
technology trends to new market opportunities. The total disbursements include the contracts signed in the
lease area as new Leasenergy product contracts (equal to approximately 2.5 million euro), which will result in
an annual emissions saving estimated at around 1,570 tonnes of annual CO,. There are around 1,370 existing
lease contracts, which have contributed to the construction of plants for the production of over 1.7 Gigawatts
of energy from renewable sources.

The Corporate and Investment Banking Division and Banca IMI have strengthened their commitment to
environmental sustainability, through the provision of forms of support aimed at helping large Italian and
international companies in their transition projects towards a low-carbon economy and/or in projects intended
to support investment plans aimed at building efficient energy production plants, diversifying energy sources
and/or rationalising consumption. Various forms of financing are available, such as: Green Revolving Credit
Facilities, Green Syndicated Loans, Green/Sustainable Bonds (e.g. SDG-Linked or Climate Change) and
Project Finance dedicated to the world of renewable energy (wind, photovoltaic, biomass, water).

During 2019, the Corporate and Investment Banking Division participated, as a Bookrunner, in 12 Green,
Social and SDG-linked Bond issues onto the Euro market, including the issue of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group
Sustainability Bond, thus confirming its role among the leading players on the Italian market.

Banca IMI, acting as Global Coordinator, Bookrunner, Mandated Lead Arranger and Green Coordinator in pool
with other banks, last November signed with Italo, leader in Europe in the high-speed railway transportation
sector, the largest-ever Green Loan in Italy and the largest worldwide in the transportation sector. The loan,
worth 1.1 billion euro, envisages bonus-award mechanisms for the company linked to sustainability principles.
As part of the transaction, Banca IMI entered into a further agreement with Italo to cover the loan (ESG Linked
Hedging) which will reward the virtuous conduct of the transport company, improving the conditions of the
derivative if certain ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) sustainability indicators are complied with.
