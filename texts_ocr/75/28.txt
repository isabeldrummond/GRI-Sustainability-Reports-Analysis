Identity and profile

The results of the materiality analysis are graphically represented using a Cartesian coordinate system known
as the Materiality Matrix which reports the company’s interest on the vertical axis and the stakeholder’s interest
on the horizontal axis. This representation makes it possible to assess the significance (“materiality”) of each
issue on the basis of its overall position with respect to the two axes. The 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo Materiality
