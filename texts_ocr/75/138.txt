In order to support southern Italy agricultural companies affected by the exceptional adverse weather of
November 2019, a fund of 100 million euro has been set aside for businesses that suffered damage to crops
and production facilities. In February 2019, two agreements were entered into with Confartigianato-Imprese
Udine and Confartigianato-Imprese Marca Trevigiana, respectively, for which the Bank allocated two credit
plafond of 100 million euro each in favour of the companies in the wood sector to finance local businesses,
including the option to access the Circular Economy credit plafond that can be used, in this case, for the
purpose of reforestation, regeneration of the ecosystem and timber harvesting, in order to avoid degradation.
Intesa Sanpaolo also set aside a credit plafond of 50 million euro for loans dedicated to agricultural companies
that wish to adopt measures against the brown marmorated stink bug in Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and
Trentino-Alto Adige regions.

CIRCULAR ECONOMY

The Circular Economy is fundamental for economic development that generates a positive environmental and
social impact. The circular model is based on the redesign of industrial processes and business models to
generate economic and competitive advantage for companies, with a regenerative approach towards natural
capital. Its objectives include the generation of a virtuous cycle in the use of resources, overcoming the linear
model which involves extraction, production, sale and waste.

The Intesa Sanpaolo Group confirmed its commitment to the Circular Economy by promoting the spread of the
model, drawing on the support of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the main promoter of the global transition
towards the Circular Economy. The 2019-2021 three-year cooperation agreement has been renewed, confirming
Intesa Sanpaolo's role as Global Partner of the Foundation. Intesa Sanpaolo will continue to redefine business
strategies in an innovative way, ensuring financial support for investments to facilitate the redesign of the industrial
system. The activity is considered of primary importance for the Group and is indicated as a strategic pillar within
the 2018-2021 Business Plan.

The transition to a Circular Economy continued, also with the contribution of the Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation
Center, a Group company which oversees all the Circular Economy activities.

The Circular Economy Lab was launched in 2018 in Milan, thanks to a Framework Agreement between Intesa
Sanpaolo and Fondazione Cariplo, and followed by a strategic partnership between Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation
Center and Cariplo Factory, with the goal of supporting and assisting the transformation of the Italian economic
system and disseminating new models of value creation in the collective interest, by accelerating the transition to
the Circular Economy. The Circular Economy Lab's strategy envisages open innovation operating methodologies
aimed at finding innovative solutions and technologies within the scope of the circular economy and the related
activities are based on three pillars:

* promoting the dissemination of knowledge about the Circular Economy, involving national and international
players;

* supporting start-ups, SMEs and Corporate entities in the adoption of circularity principles, promoting the
dialogue between companies, technology suppliers and investors;

* accelerating circular transformation through Open Innovation and Circular Economy Advisory programmes.

In order to provide concrete support to companies involved in the transition process, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group,
within the time-frame of the 2018-2021 Business Plan, has decided to provide a credit plafond of up to 5 billion euro,
aimed at companies which adopt the circular model with innovative procedures, granting the best conditions for
accessing credit. In particular, as part of the credit process, Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center, based on criteria
connected with investments in the Circular Economy defined together with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, is
responsible for providing a technical assessment on the level of circularity of the initiatives proposed. Specifically,
the eligibility criteria are as follows:

« Solutions that extend the product-life or cycles of use of goods and/or materials (application of modular design;
implementation of reverse logistics programmes; reuse, repair and regeneration or reconditioning of products);

« Production processes fuelled by and/or products made of renewable or recycled resources;

« Products and/or services that significantly increase effectiveness and efficiency of the resources consumption,
within the company or along its supply chain (application of principles of industrial symbiosis and realization
of an integrated supply chain that makes waste streams into feedstock; closing loops and/or apply circular
economy and systemic design principles; creation or promotion of a supply chain guided by circular principles);

* Design and/or manufacture products that can be fully recycled or composted within an efficient framework of
collection, separation and recycling after use (Compostable products, recyclable products);

« Innovative technologies that enable circular business models (Internet of Things to empower traceability
services (reverse-logistic) and/or predictive maintenance; use of additive manufacturing/3D printing to increase
the easy-to-repair degree and the materials efficiency; Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and Cloud
Computing aiming at dematerialization services and/or marketplaces development for secondary raw materials).
