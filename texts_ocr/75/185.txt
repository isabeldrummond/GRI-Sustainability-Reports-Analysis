* Calculated as the number of employees returning to work after leave out of the number of employees using parental leave. The rate considers only employees on the workforce
whose parental leave period ended by the end of the reporting year as having returned to work.
Retention rate of returning employees, who are still employees: not available. Due to the variety and complexity of leave that may be used, it would be necessary to monitor each

employee to calculate the indicator, affecting their privacy rights.
