Relations with stakeholders: engagement and listening

In its 2018-2021 Business Plan, Intesa Sanpaolo set itself significant sustainability objectives that involve
various stakeholders. In 2019, the stakeholder engagement activities were carried out in accordance with
the AA1000 AccountAbility standard and used specific engagement methods for the different categories of
stakeholders, also addressing the topics outlined in the materiality matrix.

The 2019 activities focused on monitoring, refining and investigating in more depth the priorities assigned by
the stakeholders in the first year of implementation of the Business Plan. This year, a more specific focus was
placed on the environment by involving some stakeholders identified on the basis of their affinity to environmental
issues and sustainable finance. The engagement plan was defined by Intesa Sanpaolo with the collaboration
of the internal departments which have direct relations with all categories of stakeholder on a daily basis. This
engagement is documented in minutes taken down in collaboration with the relevant parties and with their
approval and is managed by an independent third party. The topics proposed to individual stakeholders relate
to different aspects of sustainability, not limiting the listening process to the issues traditionally connected with
each category, encouraging broader discussions and new perspectives.

ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVES AND ISSUES COVERED

The stakeholders involved in the 2019 engagement activities are: corporate and retail customers, the environment,
represented by the scientific community, the community, through dialogues with associations and bodies,
shareholders, in particular sustainable ones, and employees, involved directly and through trade union associations.
Some of these stakeholders were involved in a thematic focus on the relationship between the environment and
finance, which investigated their expectations regarding the role of financial institutions in fighting climate change.
The findings from these activities were also assessed in relation to the issues previously emerged with the aim of
conducting in-depth analyses with respect to the 2018-2021 Business Plan.

The following table outlines the methods used to engage stakeholders included in the analysis, broken down into
individual categories and relative topics, proposed thanks to the listening tools implemented.
