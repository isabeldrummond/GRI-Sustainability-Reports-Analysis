THE 2018-2021 BUSINESS PLAN

The 2018-2021 Business Plan seeks to maintain solid and sustainable value creation and distribution for all
stakeholders. In addition, Intesa Sanpaolo, already a leader in the field of Corporate Social Responsibility, is
seeking to become an exemplary group in terms of social and cultural responsibility.

The Business Plan integrates the commitments set by the Group, by defining measures to contribute to
global development, in order to support its customers, promote the development and well-being of people
and communities, and protect the environment, including through combating climate change. In particular,
Intesa Sanpaolo wishes to become an exemplary group for society, through a series of initiatives aimed at,
among other things, granting loans to groups who have difficulty accessing credit despite their potential,
ensuring support to disadvantaged people, mitigating the consequences of natural disasters for households
and businesses, supporting the Circular Economy’s development, and making the most of the artistic, cultural
and historical heritage of the Group to promote art and culture in Italy and abroad. In this sense, the Group,
including in its strategy, takes into consideration the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United
Nations, and therefore wishes to provide a concrete response not only in wording, but also in implementing
the commitments undertaken, whose results have now become an integral part of the Bank’s sustainable and
responsible business model. Intesa Sanpaolo thus intends to seize every opportunity to strengthen the central
role of sustainability and social and environmental responsibility within its overall strategy.

All this is made possible by the Bank's ability to consistently create value over time, reinforcing the Group’s
resilient and highly-diversified business model, in particular positioning itself as a leading player in wealth
management & protection.

In a highly digitalised and competitive world, the Bank is continuing to achieve its goals by relying upon its
values and the proven implementation capacity of a results-oriented delivery machine.

The Group's strategy hinges on a number of priorities that are now part and parcel of Intesa Sanpaolo, which
aims to confirm its leadership as a Bank of the real economy, supporting households and businesses. With
a strong balance sheet and a leading position, the Group fulfils requests for credit and responsibly manages
customers’ savings. Intesa Sanpaolo wishes to be a Bank with sustainable profitability, in which the operating
results, productivity, risk profile, liquidity and soundness/leverage are carefully balanced.

The 2018-2021 Business Plan is based on three central pillars:

« significant de-risking at no cost to Shareholders;
* cost reduction through further simplification of the operating model;
* revenue growth seizing new business opportunities.

The enabling factors are people, who continue to be Intesa Sanpaolo’s most important resource, and the
completion of the digital transformation, which will make it possible to increase the levels of efficiency and
offer advanced, high-quality products and services to customers.

People, in particular, will benefit from a series of initiatives aimed at strengthening their involvement,
promoting inclusion and ongoing dialogue with the company, developing the best talents, improving skills,
maintaining employment levels, promoting internal fairness and facilitating a work/life balance through
flexibility initiatives (see 2019 Financial Statements, page 43 [i]).

Through the Business Plan, Intesa Sanpaolo has set itself goals which will generate value for its stakeholders
and for the achievement of which the Group has continued to develop the main strategic projects (see 2019
Financial Statements, page 44). As a solid Bank that is increasingly profitable, Intesa Sanpaolo is able to
make a positive contribution for the interests of its shareholders and all other stakeholders.
