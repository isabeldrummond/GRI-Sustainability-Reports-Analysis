2019 Actions

Circular economy (see page 139)

The Group's commitment to the Circular Economy, developed in
partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, planned - for the 2018-
2021 period - to establish a dedicated credit plafond amounting to 5 billion
euro and the launch of the Circular Economy Lab, the first Italian laboratory
- in conjunction with Cariplo Foundation - with the aim of generating value
for the Group's customers companies by developing research and circular
innovation. At the end of 2019, the credit plafond made it possible to
disburse approximately 760 million euro in 63 projects for the transition to
the circular economy, against 248 projects under review.

The placement of the first 750 million euro Sustainability Bond was
successfully completed in November 2019, against a demand of over 3.5
billion euro, intended to support the loans granted by the Bank under the
credit plafond dedicated to the Circular Economy.

Environment and climate change (see page 127)

All the actions carried out in 2019, in line with the Environmental Plan,
confirm the Group's commitment to reducing its environmental footprint. In
2019, Scope1 + Scope2 greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 21.4%.
Management of potential risks and impacts related to climate chan-
ge (see page 46)

Since October 2018, Intesa Sanpaolo has decided to support the
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD), with the voluntary commitment to disseminate
transparent reporting on the risks and opportunities linked to climate
change, in order to include the main climate-related communications
within the framework of financial disclosures for stakeholders, as shown in
the TCFD Reconciliation table (see page 195).

Climate Change Action Plan (see page 130)

Anew Multi-Year Environmental Sustainability Plan — the Climate Change
Action Plan — was drawn up in 2017 with targets for 2022 and 2037. The
monitoring of the Environmental Plan highlighted for 2019 a trend in line
with the CO, emission reduction forecasts.

Combating corruption (see page 52)

The Group’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines continued to be implemented. In
May 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo was among the first banks in Europe to receive
the certificate of compliance of its anti-bribery management system with
UNI ISO 37001 international standards.

In 2019, training to prevent corruption and money laundering involved
77,383 employees for a total of approximately 307,000 hours provided.
