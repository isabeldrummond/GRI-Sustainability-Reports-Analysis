Studi e Ricerche per il Mezzogiorno (SRM) is a Group's research centre aimed at disseminating economic
knowledge and culture, with a particular focus on the development of southern Italy, Maritime Economy and
Energy. During 2019 SRM participated in a number of national and international meetings and seminars on
environment, Green Economy, Blue Economy and sustainability, thus extending its ability to analyse those
phenomena.

SRM, among other things, is also part of SOS LOG, the association for the development of sustainable logistics,
whose mission is the dissemination of information, research and initiatives aimed at spreading the culture of
sustainable transport and logistics.

Intesa Sanpaolo confirmed its commitment to the development of renewable energy in Africa, becoming a Founding
Member of Res4Africa. The foundation, which includes some of the main players in the Italian and European
energy sector, has the aim of promoting a market, regulatory and financial context that allows investments to
be made in renewable energy on the African continent. The partners of Res4Africa include, in addition to Intesa
Sanpaolo, Enel Green Power, Siemens Gamesa, Terna, PWC, Engie EPS, Prysmian, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti.
In 2019, the Foundation's activity mainly resulted in the organisation of business-to-government events and
seminars, preceded by the conduct of market studies, in order to exchange views with the main decision makers
of the target African countries on the interventions to be taken to enable investments in renewables, as well as
in the organisation of capacity building seminars to create local skills; in addition, the RenewAfrica initiative was
launched, with the aim of boosting private investment to support Africa in completing its transition towards clean
energy.

Intesa Sanpaolo, through former Mediocredito Italiano, is a partner of Milan Polytechnic in the market trends
observatory regarding the renewable energy and energy efficiency.

STUDIES

The Group’s commitment to the development of study and research projects in the environmental field continued
in 2019. Listed are some of the most important publications:

« The fifth Report on the Bio-economy - La Bioeconomia in Europa (Bio-economy in Europe), produced by the
Intesa Sanpaolo Research Department, which, in addition to providing new estimates of the value of the bio-
economy, includes an analysis of the wood and paper supply chain;

* The contribution of the water cycle and waste management to the Bio-economy, conducted by the Research
Department, provides further insight into the analysis on the bioeconomy with a specific focus on the
sustainability of the two services;

* Le aziende di TPL: alla ricerca della giusta rotta (TPL companies: in search of the right route), the result of the
consolidated collaboration of the Research Department with ASSTRA and ANCI on the issue of local public
transportation. The Report takes into consideration the growing demand in the field of mobility and the resulting
problems of congestion and pollution, which are raising awareness of the fact that only reinforcing, reclassifying
and improving the efficiency of local public transport (tram, metro, bus, regional rail network) can promote the
sustainable development of Italy;

« Il manifatturiero bresciano tra tradizione e innovazione (Brescia's manufacturing between tradition and
innovation), a survey carried out by the Research Department together with the Centro Studi dell’Associazione
Industriale Bresciana (AIB), on more than 200 companies, which allowed to shed light on past and future green
investments by Brescia's manufacturing companies;

* Un Sud che innova e produce. II valore dell’innovazione nelle filiere produttive del Mezzogiorno (The value of
innovation in southern Italy's production chains), produced by Studi e Ricerche per il Mezzogiorno (SRM) with
the contribution of the Intesa Sanpaolo Research Department. The study deals with the issue of public and
private supply and demand for innovation, to support the growth of the territories and to promote an innovative,
interconnected and eco-sustainable production model;

* SRM's Annual Report on the Italian Maritime Economy, which was presented on the national and international
stage and has now become a reference point on this matter for institutions, sector professionals, trade
associations, infrastructure and the academic world. Some of the key topics include the sustainability of port
investments, reducing emissions produced by ships, the use of environmentally friendly fuels, and reducing
road transport in favour of shipping. In 2019, in-depth studies were carried out on how to reduce external
logistics costs together with ALIS (Associazione per la Logistica e I’Intermodalita Sostenibile) and on the Ro-Ro
(Roll-on Roll-off) naval sector, which is the one that most contributes to the movement of articulated lorries from
the road to the sea and is also a sector followed closely by European institutions;

* In 2019 SRM, thanks to the new Mediterranean Energy Observatory (ENEMED) project developed together
with the Energy Security Lab (ESL) of the Energy Department of the Turin Polytechnic, presented also to the
European Parliament the Annual Report on energy in the Mediterranean, which, among other things, focuses
on renewable energies, the gas sector and energy investments in the Mediterranean area.
