DONATIONS

Parent Company donations are managed through the Fund for charitable, social and cultural donations set
out in the Articles of Association of Intesa Sanpaolo and entrusted to the direct responsibility of the Chairman
of the Board of Directors, who submits biennial Guidelines for the approval of the Board which set out the
objectives, strategic priorities and theme-based policies, including an annual Plan for allocating resources.
The Regulations govern the management of the Fund and define the precise mechanisms for the selection of
the proposed entities and projects, maintaining the principle of absolute separation of the initiatives regarding
donations from the pursuit of commercial interests. With regard to the entities, the Regulations provide for the
exclusion from the list of beneficiaries of those organisations involved in legal disputes in matters relating to
organised crime and the failure to respect human rights, peaceful coexistence and environmental protection.
Only requests for specific projects with a clear social impact are assessed, and the institutions’ ability to achieve
the stated objectives in the project are preliminarily analysed on the basis of their previous direct experiences
or that of similar bodies in terms of size and activity (track record). A rotation system is also used to ensure
the widest and most flexible use of the Fund with a maximum limit of three consecutive years of supporting
the same project. In addition, initiatives that receive sponsorship cannot be beneficiaries of donations at the
same time.

The extract from the Regulations and biennial Guidelines are available on the Group's website.

As regards the risks of this activity, the Group has deemed that the area of donations is one of the potential
areas that could lead to corruption. The Fund Regulations and the Group’s Anti-corruption Guidelines have laid
down precise rules to be followed in order to prevent such risks, which have been incorporated in the Fund's
Operating Guidelines and in the digital donation request procedure.

THE CHARITY FUND IN 2019

In 2019, the Fund for charitable, social and cultural donations of Intesa Sanpaolo has disbursed
approximately 12.9 million euro in support of over 800 projects carried out by non-profit organisations.
90% of the funds were disbursed in Italy. As every year, a part of the funds was used at the local level
for small projects with a direct local impact, an expression of the community of reference and identified
by the Regional Directorates.

The target of allocating a high share of resources (>70%) to donations supporting initiatives benefiting
more vulnerable sections of the population, operating according to an increasingly more stringent
selection mechanism in relation to project and counterparty quality, has been exceeded by a considerable
amount, reaching 95%.

In the 2019-2020 Guidelines for the Charity Fund approved by the Board of Directors, the priority Area
for action is the Social area, which has been allocated most of the available funds (82% of donations
made in 2019), whereas a smaller percentage is allocated for Research and Religious projects, and
finally to Cultural initiatives for marginalised people in difficult situations.

Social projects are selected giving priority to issues that are considered particularly relevant and urgent,
identified on the basis of an accurate analysis of national and European data. The three focuses for
the two-year period 2019-2020 are educational poverty and dropping out of school, violence against
women and children, and dementia, for which a total of about 4.5 million euro was disbursed. The
issue of dropping out of school has been addressed throughout the country, both in upper and lower
secondary school, with innovative multidisciplinary programmes aimed at students and training courses
for teachers and educators. Particular attention was paid to children with Special Educational Needs
and to students who migrated from other countries. The involvement of families is also important in
order to strengthen parenting skills and encourage active participation in the education of children. In
situations of marked socio-economic hardship, work orientation has also been provided. During 2019,
the Fund organised a meeting open to Third Sector organisations to present best practices on the topic
and to collect information on winning solutions and potential errors, to be shared with organisations. The
projects to combat violence, most of which were tailor made for a limited number of beneficiaries, have
taken the form of psychological and artistic programmes aimed at developing greater self-awareness
and self-esteem and support for women's working, housing and social autonomy. Shelter was also
guaranteed in case of danger and psychological and legal support. Recovery programmes have also
been offered to perpetrators. With regard to dementia, free outpatient and home rehabilitation services
and informal spaces for patients and their caregivers have been supported alongside these more
traditional experimental projects for the creation of Dementia Friendly Communities and the development
of new aids and technologies to facilitate care at home.

The Fund continued to support projects on social issues like: training for employment and job placement
