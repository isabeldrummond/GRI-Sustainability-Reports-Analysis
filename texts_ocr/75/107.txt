monitor suppliers regarded as suitable, who are given a rating. Furthermore, in order to ensure an assessment
of the entire supply chain, the functions involved in the purchasing process have the ability to carry out direct
checks and inspections, including through specific reporting procedures, in order to plan appropriate actions
in the event of unsatisfactory ratings. In 2019, the Procurement Head Office Department carried out checks
on 11,715 documents in Supplier Gate. The controls concerned the completion and updating over time of the
documentation and mandatory questionnaires required when registering with Supplier Gate.

With the aim of guaranteeing objectivity and transparency in the contract award phase and taking account
of ethical implications and social-environmental impact assessments, purchases are made via a system
that permits the impartial comparison of multiple offers and the tracking of all negotiations carried out.
This consequently makes it possible to identify the best trade-off between the technical and administrative
assessment (including social and environmental sustainability criteria) and a distinct and separate, purely
economic assessment. With this in mind, in its internal rules and regulations (Guidelines and Rules on the
subject) the Procurement Head Office Department manages the cases where the alternative market procedure
can be used, i.e. Direct Negotiation.

According to special clauses included in the contracts used by the Procurement Head Office Department,
suppliers that register with Intesa Sanpaolo’s Supplier Gate must respect the main content of the Code of
Ethics and the Internal Code of Conduct and undertake, when fulfilling their contractual obligations, to take
all necessary measures to prevent relevant conduct pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001, the anti-
money laundering and anti-corruption regulation. On request, they must also present documentation attesting
to their ongoing compliance with the social and environmental obligations they have undertaken, as well as the
compliance of any subcontractors.

The contractual clauses impose on the supplier the obligation to guarantee that treatment of employees in
terms of economic conditions, wages, regulations, pensions, insurance and accident prevention aspects is
not lower the minimum standards outlined in applicable laws, regulations or collective bargaining agreements
(also in relation to category and geographical area).

Standard contractual conditions oblige every supplier and subcontractor (if applicable) to operate in complete
compliance with environmental, ecology and waste management laws (including laws on the circulation and
disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment) and, where requested, to document this compliance at
any time.
