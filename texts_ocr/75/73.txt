cyber-attacks without any threat whatsoever to human safety. With regard to aggressive behaviour not for
predatory purposes, it should be noted that the phenomenon is under continuous observation, also by INAIL,
due to its continuous growth in many sectors, including Health and Education. The financial services sector
is exposed for all activities involving customer contact. In 2019, a survey of the Group's Local Networks
revealed 132 cases of aggression (9 of which involved medical treatment) compared with 96 cases in 2018 (4
of which involved health assistance). Mitigation actions consist of training on prevention and the detection and
management of incidents with the contribution of the Banca dei Territori Division, Safety and Protection and
Legal Affairs Head Office Departments.

Moreover, in 2019 the activities carried out by the Group's physical security structure were based on an on-site
verification plan of the levels of exposure to security risks and the definition of an assessment methodology
based on the application of the ISO 31000:2018 standard and the use of consolidated synthetic models for
the identification of risk indicators. These analyses have led to: the implementation of technological solutions
for theft prevention (vault protection, protection of cash systems, ATM protection, increase in alarm systems)
and robbery prevention (cash splitting systems, video surveillance and replacement of security services with
technology); the preparation of new training modules through the Apprendo platform; raising of employees'
awareness through actions carried out at branches in cooperation with the Network Departments; management
actions against non-predatory attacks in cooperation with all the Bank's relevant structures.

IT SECURITY

The Group considers the protection of information and the management of related processes a matter of
strategic importance. In line with current regulations, IT security is governed by guidelines and integrated
processes for the protection of the interests and rights of customers and employees, with rules set out in the
Bank's Integrated Internal Control System which defines responsibilities at all levels of the company.

The Group's IT security model is based on a risk-based approach and is divided into three main macro-areas:

* Orientation: defined through the review of organisational aspects and policies/processes, strategic and
predictive intelligence on cyber security risks, awareness-raising activities and information flows to internal
control bodies;

* Control: ensured through risk management, the execution of controls and the maintenance of the most
widespread safety certifications;

« Active monitoring: guaranteed through the use of the most appropriate technologies in order to ensure
adequate levels of protection to customers and through supply chain governance and management.

In accordance with the model, appropriate roles and responsibilities have been defined to support and
oversee IT security, including: the Corporate Bodies and Committees that assume general responsibility for
the guidance and control of information security, supported by the Governance Functions that ensure its
effective management; an Information Security Officer (ISO) who ensures the protection of information and
infrastructure in line with the Group's strategy, ensures consistency between internal rules, promotes and
develops integration between the various responsibilities in the Security field, guarantees compliance with the
regulatory framework; the Relevant Functions that provide services, design and release information security
solutions in compliance with the relevant regulations.

IT security tasks are carried out according to shared Group guidelines with both a centralised management
model, for Banks and companies that have a high degree of integration with the Parent Company, and a
coordination and control model for the other Group companies and the International Subsidiary Banks. The
model and the IT security management system as a whole are periodically reviewed and updated, at least once
a year or in conjunction with any external and/or internal changes (e.g. laws and regulations, organisational,
technological changes) that may have an impact in terms of IT security, with a focus on continuous improvement
thereof. The IT Security structure also conducts annual Strategic Intelligence activities aimed at identifying the
most relevant risk scenarios for the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, in relation to which the necessary policy areas are
defined in order to enable the Group's cyber readiness.

Given the growing importance of cybersecurity issues, including in relation to the 2018-2021 Business Plan,
the Intesa Sanpaolo Board of Directors annually approves the IT Security Plan which organises, in a structured
and coordinated way, the challenges introduced by cyber space through the measures already established
by the Group functions that are responsible in various capacities for guaranteeing security. The underlying
goal of the Plan is to clearly define responsibilities in the spread of the safety culture at all levels in order to
protect all of the company's assets. In particular, the Plan envisages the implementation of the Group's IT
security strategy, which must be based on a perfect knowledge of every element of the area to be protected,
which grows together with the services offered and the new risks, strongly linked to behaviour and the human
factor. This strategy is based on four main pillars (Excellence in fundamentals, Sensitivity and dynamism,
Culture, Group Governance) which have allowed for the development of the operational projects and the
