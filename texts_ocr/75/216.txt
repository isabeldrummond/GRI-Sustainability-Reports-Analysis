Pursuant to article 3.10 of Legislative decree no. 254 of 30 December 2016 (the

the stock exchange) Regulation adopted with Resolution no. 20267 of 18 January

prepared in accordance with article 4 of the decree and approved by the board of
directors on 17 March 2020 (the “Non-financial Statement’).

Responsibilities of the parent’s directors and management control
committee for the Non-financial Statement

The directors of Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. (the “parent”) are responsible for the
preparation of an Non-financial Statement in accordance with articles 3 and 4 of the
decree and the “Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards” issued
in 2016 by GRI - Global Reporting Initiative (the “GRI Standards), which they have

The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of a Non-financial Statement that is free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Moreover, the directors are responsible for the identification of the content of the Non-
financial Statement, considering the aspects indicated in article 3.1 of the decree and
the group’s business and characteristics, to the extent necessary to enable an
