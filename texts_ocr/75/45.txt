Management of potential risks and impacts related to
climate change

Climate change represents a complex challenge that is set to have a major impact on the future of our planet
and society. Climate change is responsible for the increase in extreme weather events (flooding, whirlwinds,
forest fires, etc.), and has permanent effects on climate conditions (increase in average temperature, increase
in sea level, etc.) which may lead to significant economic, environmental and social costs. These events
may generate a loss of wealth and income for companies and families, thus having a potential impact on the
financial system. Banks have a key role to play and a responsibility on the issue of climate change, because
they have the possibility of directing loans and investments towards companies that are virtuous from an
environmental point of view, and operate with a view towards raising awareness and risk containment. In the
same way, banks must analyse and contain possible risks to their buildings and consequently to their daily
operations.

The growing focus given to the possible consequences of climate change has led to a greater awareness
among financial institutions of the need to develop specific knowledge about such risks and the opportunities
associated with them.

Climate change risks are divided into “physical risks”, associated with the physical impact of climate events,
and “transition risks” arising from the process of adjustment to an economy based on low carbon emissions,
associated with the changes in public policies, technology and consumer choices.

Since October 2018, Intesa Sanpaolo has decided to support the recommendations of the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), with the voluntary commitment to disseminate transparent
reporting on the risks and opportunities linked to climate change, in order to include the main climate-related
communications within the framework of financial disclosures for stakeholders, as shown in the TCFD
Reconciliation table (see page 195).

GOVERNANCE

In 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo strengthened its governance of sustainability and climate change. With the support of the
Steering Committee, the Managing Director and CEO submits the definition of strategic guidelines and sustainability
policies (ESG) including the fight against climate change to the relevant Board Committees and the Board of
Directors. The Board of Directors then approves the strategic guidelines and policies on sustainability (ESG) with the
support of the Risks Committee, taking into account the objectives of solid and sustainable creation and distribution
of value for all stakeholders, including the environment as declared in the Group’s Code of Ethics. Moreover, the
Steering Committee — composed of the first organisational line — meets quarterly to examine sustainability issues
(ESG), including the fight against climate change.

In this context, Intesa Sanpaolo actively participates in a series of international initiatives, including the Global
Compact, the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI) and the Equator Principles,
and since 2019 the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), an initiative that aims to formalise the banking
sector's commitment to increasing social and environmental sustainability. Through its subsidiaries, it adheres to the
Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI) in asset management and the Principles for Sustainable Insurance
(PSI) in the insurance sector.
