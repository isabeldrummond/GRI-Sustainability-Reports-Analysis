this context, in 2019 the Intragroup Mobility structure and HR Proactive Placement continued to oversee the
mobility tools and processes, verifying the availability of internal personnel and the necessary expertise on the
basis of the identified requirements, while also guaranteeing the development of employees in new roles as
per the Group strategy.

In 2019 employer branding was primarily focused on launching communication strategies that convey Intesa
Sanpaolo’s founding values: internationality, flexibility, challenge and innovation were the values at the heart
of the messages, together with the importance of diversity, inclusion and people in general. Both digital and
physical communication channels were used. Firstly, a new Careers page was created in 2019 to further
improve the job application experience. Inside, candidates can easily find information on current vacancies,
divided according to job family and including a section dedicated to protected categories. Digital employer
branding activities were also extended to social media sites LinkedIn (approx. 159,800 views in 2019 with an
interest rate of 3.5%, up by 196% compared with 2018) and Instagram. In the non-digital arena new formats
and contact opportunities with potential candidates were developed in 2019 including the Careers Meeting
Point and the ‘contest games’; the partnerships with leading Italian universities also continued with over 40
events held, including Career days, workshops and training seminars. 2019 also saw the launch of Cyber
Security Academy in collaboration with Milan Polytechnic, in which the Group’s line managers participate
as teachers, while the Job Center continues to focus on selection and recruitment issues. In support of the
Group’s recruitment plan, over 100,000 CVs were assessed and over 5,000 candidates interviewed in 2019.

LABOUR RELATIONS

As well as by the industry outlook, relations with the Trade Unions are also regulated by the Labour/Management
Relations Protocol which has made it possible to develop a specific union relations model in the Intesa Sanpaolo
Group. Dialogue with the Trade Unions regarding company projects is ongoing, prompt and aimed at identifying
shared solutions to the various requirements that come to the attention of the Parties. This also takes place
in accordance with trade union representation in Italy (77.30% of current employees), in line with national
representation in the sector. 33 agreements were signed in 2019 which continued to focus attention on the
Group’s integrated welfare system. The Time Bank, Flexible Work and the various initiatives for the development
of policies and tools to address problems relating to the area of disabilities and to promote the culture of fostering
inclusion are just some examples that define and characterise the overall direction that the second-level collective
bargaining agreement has been going in for some time. To this end, the activities of the Welfare, Safety and
Sustainable Development Committee set up following the Labour Relations Protocol were also crucial. This
bilateral body, which adequately represents both the company and the Trade Unions, is supplemented each
time by technical experts that are able to offer specific expertise on the issues in question. In 2019, also in
accordance with and in support of the Business Plan, the Committee promoted a series of measures and actions
that contributed significantly to the development of issues connected with inclusion, organisational wellbeing,
disability and support for employees at particular times in their private and/or professional lives.

COMPANY POLICIES

The enhancement of human resources and the principle of excellence based on the recognition of
merit are defined in the Group Code of Ethics and Remuneration and Incentive Policies. Specific tools
for managers and professionals make it possible to implement structured performance assessment
processes and map skills.

The Group’s Remuneration and Incentive Policies aim to align the behaviour of the staff with the interests
of all stakeholders, focusing their activities on the achievement of sustainable medium to long-term
objectives within the framework of the prudent assumption of current and prospective risks, as well as
contribute to making the Group an “Employer of choice” for its ability to attract, motivate and retain top
resources. Designed to respect regulatory requirements and based on correct relations with customers,
the Policies link wages to risks undertaken, aligning the remuneration systems with prudent financial
and non-financial risk management policies. In addition, the Policies are inspired by the principles of
merit, rewarding outstanding contributions and guaranteeing a close relationship between bonuses and
results achieved/risks taken, equality in both internal and external terms and as regards gender, and
