FIGHTING AGAINST CORRUPTION

The Group’s Code of Ethics provides that business goals are pursued with honesty, fairness and with a sense of
responsibility in full compliance with the rules, professional ethics and spirit of signed agreements. It recognises the
strategic importance of the work aimed at ensuring compliance with internal and external regulations and codes of
conduct, and sets high standards of compliance for all employees, which are also included in the Code of Conduct.
The Code of Ethics also establishes Intesa Sanpaolo’s commitment to contributing to combating corruption,
supporting the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) Guidelines, and the anti-
corruption principles established by the United Nations in 2003, including by taking a “zero tolerance” approach.
The Group has adopted strict internal procedures and specific Guidelines over time to prevent the risk of corruption.

MODEL FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LIABILITY PURSUANT TO ITALIAN
LEGISLATIVE DECREE 231/01

Legislative Decree 231/01 establishes a system of administrative liability for Italian Companies for certain
specifically identified crimes or offences, committed in their interest or for their benefit by their senior
officers and/or employees. Intesa Sanpaolo has long had a specific Organisational, Management and
Control Model in place that defines the principles of control and conduct that must be adopted to reduce
the risk of committing crimes and offences envisaged by the Decree, including, in particular, corruption,
environmental crimes and the violation of human rights.

In preparing the Model, the Bank first of all took into account all the existing regulations, procedures and
control systems already being implemented, insofar as they were also suitable as measures for preventing
crimes and illegal conduct in general, including those envisaged by Italian Legislative Decree 231/01.

The Bank identified the following as specific instruments already existing and aimed at planning the

formation and implementation of company decisions and carrying out controls on business operations,

including in relation to crimes and offences to be prevented:

« the corporate governance rules, adopted in compliance with the Corporate Governance Code for listed
companies and the relevant company regulations and regulatory legislation;

« internal regulations and company policies;

« the Group's Code of Ethics, Internal Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Guidelines;
