Currently, the portion of the managed portfolio invested in issuers that have received a sustainability rating of
less than 3 (threshold of sufficiency for initial inclusion in the portfolio) is 8.5%. No red flag was assigned in the
risk monitoring phase.

For both products, the correct and consistent inclusion of ESG factors in the investment process was certified
during 2019.

During the year, as part of the Fideuram Alternative Investments (FAI) product range, the new FAI Fideuram
Mercati Europei fund was launched, created in partnership with a French company specialising in private
markets using ESG filters on all asset classes.

Also regarding the lines of portfolio management, Fideuram Investimenti has developed individual investment
solutions that fulfil the ethics and sustainability criteria.

Furthermore, during 2019 the management of the equity component of the Fideuram Pension Fund sub-funds
was started according to ESG exclusion criteria (negative screening), identifying sectors and companies (like
coal mining, conventional and unconventional weapons production, gambling, adult entertainment, tobacco)
excluded. Therefore, about 740 companies at a global level have been excluded, the only partial exceptions
being companies producing conventional weapons with a weight in their turnover below 30%.

Since 2017 Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking has been offering the GP Mix Sustainable, a portfolio management
line characterised by an investment process aimed at building a balanced and diversified portfolio on international
markets, combining fundamental analysis with specific sustainability assessments aimed at pursuing financial
objectives, as well as social and environmental results. In the choice of financial instruments, the portfolio
management prioritises, non-exclusively, governments, companies and supranational bodies aligned with the
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

More specifically, the assessment is based on a combination of negative criteria, ESG integration and best in
class. The sustainability assessment is carried out in two steps: beforehand through an internal sustainable
quality assessment process and afterwards through a sustainable rating developed by the dedicated advisor.
Together with a quarterly financial report, a report is produced that highlights the contribution to the Sustainable
Development Objectives monitored during the period.

As far as the dissemination of ESG issues is concerned, in addition to support materials for the presentation and
sale of products, specific and informative measures have also been implemented involving Group companies,
in particular Eurizon Capital SGR regarding Eurizon Ethical and ESG funds and in particular those dedicated
to Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking.

Focus Sostenibilita, the internal newsletter on Asset Management, was created in order to maintain and
increase periodic attention on the subject.

 

PENSION FUND WITH DEFINED CONTRIBUTION OF THE INTESA SANPAOLO GROUP

The defined contribution Pension Fund of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group observes the Principles for Responsible
Investment (UN PRI). In addition to the Code of Ethics, in 2018 the Pension Fund adopted Guidelines on Socially
Responsible Investment inspired by the most widespread international practices on sustainability, and in 2019
it added a section dedicated to the integration of ESG assets into investment strategies. The Pension Fund
thus decided to launch a review of its portfolios to exclude investment in companies belonging to the two most
controversial sectors, unconventional weapons and tobacco (the impact on the Fund's sub-funds of investments
in companies involved in both sectors is less than 1%). For 2020 the plan is to establish a new Sub-fund called
Futuro Sostenibile that will invest in sectors and companies with a specific focus on Climate Change. In the course
of 2020, the Pension Fund is also preparing to revise its Strategic Asset Allocation with the aim of establishing
future management mandates on the basis of the ESG criteria set out in the Guidelines, starting with contractual
articulation with the selected managers.

Finally, in 2019 the Pension Fund joined the collective initiative Climate Action 100+ (CA100+), which the international
