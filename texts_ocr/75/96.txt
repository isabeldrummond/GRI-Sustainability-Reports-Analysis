Society

as a means of social inclusion, health poverty and the fight against disease, physical and intellectual
disabilities, and inclusive amateur sports. Some of the main projects supported in 2019 include actions
on bullying and cyberbullying, NEET job placement initiatives, young people with psychological frailty,
long-term unemployed adults, drug addicts out of rehabilitation and HIV/AIDS patients, projects to
support terminally ill and cancer patients, with specific attention to children. Particular attention was paid
to the suburbs and to socially and economically degraded areas.

In 2019 as well the Chairmanship decided to make part of the Fund’s resources available to contribute
towards the goals of the 2018-2021 Business Plan and, in particular, to support food poverty initiatives
aimed at guaranteeing the coverage or an increase in the number of meals distributed by charitable
institutions across Italy, as established by the "Intesa Sanpaolo for disadvantaged people" project. In
total, in 2019 1.9 million euro was donated to Caritas Italiana, Comunita di Sant’Egidio ACAP, Gruppi di
Volontariato Vincenziano AIC Italia, Opera San Francesco per i Poveri and Piccola Casa della Divina
Provwvidenza — Cottolengo, Provincia Sant’Antonio Frati Minori — Antoniano e Progetto Arca for the
distribution of around 3,400 meals a day, equal to around 34% (over 1.2 million meals) of the total meals
distributed during the year (approximately 3.3 million meals) with the support of the Group.
Collaboration continued with the International Subsidiary Banks Division to disseminate new methods
of selecting, monitoring and reporting projects, following the example of the initiatives taken by the
Parent Bank. To this end, Rules for Donations in the International Subsidiary Banks have been issued
which define new principles and procedures in the assessment and disbursement of donations. The
objective of the Rules is to align decision-making processes in these matters with Group processes and
approaches, integrating a more strategic and informed view of potential risks.

At the operational level, two initiatives were launched in the Division: support for the people affected by
the earthquake in Albania and the provision of psychosocial assistance and care services to children
affected by cancer and diseases of the central nervous system along with their parents and caregivers in
Ukraine. The Fund has also made available a substantial part of the resources allocated to international
projects to reward worthy initiatives freely offered by non-profit entities and carried out within the scope
of the Division. Five projects were supported in Egypt, Albania, Romania and the Republic of Moldova.
Overall, disbursements in the countries where the Group is present with its subsidiaries exceeded
700,000 euro (more than half of the international donations).

The Fund has also continued the fight against poverty in the world with initiatives in countries with a low
or medium Human Development Index. Of particular note is the UNHCR project in Lebanon to provide
access to primary school for Syrian refugee children.

NOTEWORTHY SOCIAL INITIATIVES FOR THE GROUP
INTESA SANPAOLO AND INEQUALITY: THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY

Currently in Italy there are about 5 million people in absolute poverty and about 9 million in relative poverty.
Inequality is growing and the Bank has promoted one of the most important initiatives in the country to support
those in difficulty, included in the 2018-2021 Business Plan, the Intesa Sanpaolo programme for disadvantaged
people, with the goal of supporting the most vulnerable people, providing them with 10,000 meals a day, 6,000
beds a month, and 3,000 medicines and items of clothing a month.

The Bank confirms its role as a point of reference for the country in terms of growth in solidarity and social cohesion,
a founding element since the Group's charitable foundations were established 500 years ago, promoting concrete
collaboration ecosystems based on the values of reciprocity, responsibility and subsidiarity, with a circular welfare
approach in which the relationships between the various stakeholders make it possible to contribute to the
implementation of actions for the collective interest with long-lasting impacts and thanks to its economic results and
solidity, it returns a part of its resources to the communities it operates in and to civil society in general.

In the development of the Programme, the Bank designed and developed initiatives which, with efficiency and
innovation, complement the donations in support of third party projects, in a structured dialogue concerning social
emergencies with the leading voices of the community and co-planning round tables that allowed the definition
of high-impact actions implemented on a local and national level, that can also be replicated, establishing
partnerships, even long-lasting ones, with non-profit organisations, institutions and corporate customers.

With the support of non-profit organisations, the Programme has so far made it possible to distribute about 8.7
million meals, offer over 519,000 beds and ensure about 131,000 medicines and 103,000 items of clothing,
results that exceed the original objectives of the Business Plan.
