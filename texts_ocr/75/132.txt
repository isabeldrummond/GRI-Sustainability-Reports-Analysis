ENERGY 103-2; 302-1 Environment and Climate change

In the Group companies within Italy, the purchase of energy from renewable sources is ensured by Guarantees
of Origin and covers 96% of electricity purchased.

In the International Subsidiary Banks, the situation differs, also in relation to the limits imposed by certain
national regulations. Once again, this year, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank (Slovenia) has eliminated its emissions
by purchasing all its energy from hydroelectric sources, while Privredna Banka Zagreb (Croatia) purchases
around 60% of its electricity from renewable sources. Additionally, thanks to the national energy mix part of the
electricity used by Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania (100%), Banca Intesa Beograd (Serbia) (27%), VUB Banka
(Slovakia) (15%) and CIB Bank (Hungary) (9%) comes from renewable sources.

ENERGY AUDITS

Being a large company, Intesa Sanpaolo and its subsidiaries must carry out energy audits every four years
on the premises where they exercise control of energy consumption, pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree
102/14. In 2019, multi-site companies, such as Intesa Sanpaolo, had to carry out the audits on a proportionate
and sufficiently representative number of sites in order to define a true picture of the company's overall
energy performance and to identify, in a reliable manner, the most significant areas for improvement. Energy
audits were conducted in 37 sites in Italy: 17 branches and 20 properties between buildings and data centres
distributed throughout the national territory. The first analyses highlight saving opportunities on a limited number
of properties with simple management interventions. Possible improvements were highlighted against short
and medium-term investments regarding the replacement of UPS, installation of inverters and photovoltaic
plants, as well as the replacement of lighting fixtures (with LED lights).

With reference to international subsidiary companies operating in EU countries where the regulatory obligation
is required to be met, in 2019 CIB Bank (Hungary) fulfilled local requests through the ISO 50001 certification,
VUB Banka (Slovakia) conducted 16 energy audits and finally Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Ireland conducted 1
energy audit.

MOBILITY

The Mobility Management function, part of the Labour Affairs and Policies Head Office Department, is dedicated
to supporting employee commuting, to improve their quality but also to promote sustainable means of transport.
The goal is to translate the feedback from employees into concrete actions in order to provide a structured
range of options for daily commutes and implement the actions of the Home-Work Commuting Plans.

The main goals pursued by the Intesa Sanpaolo Group are: the reduction in the use of private individual
transport, as requested by the so-called Ronchi Decree, the improvement of road safety, as established by the
international ISO 39001:2012 standard, and the reduction of the Group’s CO, emissions.

As regards the last objective, the most significant initiatives are:

the spread of Flexible Work and Training, which innovatively combine the management of people’s private
lives with the company's organisational requirements (see page 119);

signing a union agreement on work-life balance, which also introduced measures to help people that work far
away and that have specific personal needs to move closer to their residence or home;

the Mobility Office platform which promotes the use of public transport, enabling employees to request
annual season tickets directly from their workstation and also to take advantage of discounted rates with the
option of paying in instalments (the service is available in certain cities - Bologna, Florence, Milan, Padua,
Rome, Turin and Venice);

company shuttle service available in Turin/Moncalieri, Milan/Assago and Padua/Sarmeola di Rubano, which
have a positive impact on the environment (an estimated 540 tonnes of CO, avoided) as well as on people’s
quality of life; at the Bank of Alexandria (Egypt), a shuttle service to Cairo and Alexandria is available;
development of in sharing services (car, motorbike and bike). In Italy, ALI - the Intesa Sanpaolo employees’
association - has entered into agreements with the main networks in a number of cities. Bicycles owned by
the Bank are available at Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Romania, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank (Slovenia) and CIB Bank
(Hungary) and as from this year also in VUB Banka (Slovakia). Special bicycle parking spaces are available
in Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania and Eximbank (Moldova) as well as in Privredna Banka Zagreb (Croatia),
CIB Bank (Hungary) and VUB Banka (Slovakia) where, in addition, employees can benefit from additional
services (changing rooms and showers). In particular, Privredna Banka Zagreb (Croatia), on the occasion of
World Environment Day, promoted the use of the bicycle as an alternative means of transport. In addition, in
2018, CIB Bank signed a contract for the use of car sharing to replace taxis, which will only use electric cars;
