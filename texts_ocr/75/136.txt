COMPANY POLICIES

In accordance with the principles of the Code of Ethics and the Rules for environmental and energy
policy, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group has always paid particular attention to the portfolio of green products
and services it offers to its customers, also with the goal of contributing to combating climate change.
International studies and research show that climate change may also be a business opportunity and a
lever for economic growth, considering the fact that, in order to achieve the European Union's climate
and energy targets for 2030, significant investments will be required as highlighted by the European
Commission's Action Plan for financing sustainable growth and the European Green Deal. In January
2020, Intesa Sanpaolo stated its willingness to make available a programme for the disbursement of 50
billion euro in Italy in the coming years.

Intesa Sanpaolo is active in promoting renewable energy, energy efficiency and the circular business
model by supporting their development and assisting the various customer segments, committed to
reducing their environmental footprint, by promoting green products and services offered through the
sales network in Italy and abroad. The Group also takes heed of the impacts generated by customers
and suppliers, contributing to the spread of virtuous processes and conduct as regards the environment.
In addition, particular importance is given to training and research initiatives, as well as to events on
environmental issues organised by Intesa Sanpaolo and/or its partners.

LOANS AND SERVICES FOR THE GREEN AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY

In 2019, the Group's disbursements for the Green and Circular Economy totalled approximately 2.2 billion
euro, equal to 3.7% of all Group's loans.

GREEN ECONOMY

In 2019, the Group's disbursements for the Green Economy totalled 1,419 million euro (almost 20 billion in the
2010-2019 period).

The offer involves all customer segments: retail customers (3.7%), businesses and Third Sector (13.3%),
corporate & project finance (83.0%).

The Bank continued to provide loans and mortgages for environmental purposes to retail customers in 2019.
These loans regarded the replacement of fixtures and high-performance boilers, the renovation of buildings
from an energy efficiency perspective, the purchase of environmentally-friendly vehicles and the installation
of solar and photovoltaic panels. In line with the attention to the green world, Intesa Sanpaolo participates
in the EeMAP (Energy efficient Mortgages Action Plan) project, a European initiative that aims to create a
standardised energy efficient mortgage, with a view to encouraging the redevelopment of buildings and the
purchase of highly efficient properties through preferential financial conditions, sharing the association's criteria
on green issues. In this context, initiatives dedicated to green financing will be launched in 2020 to encourage
both the purchase of high energy efficiency properties and the redevelopment of the existing real estate assets.
“Valorizzazione Immobiliare”, an ancillary service to loans, seeks to support customers who intend to invest in
their homes through energy redevelopment and restructuring works, providing free information on tax benefits
and savings on energy bills, as well as to support the best loan and home protection solutions. Customers
can also take advantage of discounts on the services offered by partners of the initiative which operate in the
energy savings and redevelopment sectors.

Among the insurance products that aim to cover customers’ insurance needs in the Family, Health and Property
areas, the “XME Protezione” insurance cover, places special emphasis on protection against natural disasters,
offering protection from damage caused by atmospheric events such as floods and cloudbursts. The coverage
will reimburse up to 80% of the customer's property value. Over 76,000 “XME Protezione” policies with flood
coverage were taken out at the end of 2019.

In the segment of motor insurance products, the “ViaggiaConMe’ policy with consumption-based plan provides
for a premium linked to the kilometres travelled during the year: once the defined threshold has been exceeded,
the premium to be paid will be integrated based on the additional kilometres travelled. The proposed solution
therefore discourages the use of vehicles, with potential positive impacts on the environment.

Lastly, following the environmental disasters and extraordinary weather events that affected Italy also in 2019,
