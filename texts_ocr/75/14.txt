ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE VALUE
GENERATED

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE’

The Intesa Sanpaolo Group closed its income statement for 2019 with net income of 4,182 million euro, up by
around 3.3% on 4,050 million euro for the previous year, which also included the positive effect of significant
non-recurring income. The change was driven by a rise in operating income, a fall in operating costs, and
lower adjustments for credit risk. The amount of levies and charges for the banking system was still significant,
although slightly lower than in 2018.

In detail, operating income amounted to 18,083 million euro, up on 2018 (+1.5%) due to the significant
performances of profits on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value (+31% at 1,928 million), the
increase in income from insurance business (+9% at 1,184 million) and the stability of net fee and commission
income (+0.1% at 7,952 million). By contrast, net interest income (-3.7% at 7,005 million) declined, primarily
due to lower interest on non-performing assets as a result of de-risking activities, as did other net operating
income (4 million against 34 million in 2018).

Operating costs were down (-2.1% at 9,290 million), both for personnel expenses (-1.2%), due to the
downsizing of the workforce, and for administrative expenses (-5%), which fell across all the main expense
items. Amortisation — which under the new IFRS 16 also includes the amount related to property and equipment
and intangible assets under operating leases — was, overall, essentially in line with the same figure in 2018
(+0.1%).

Net adjustments to loans fell overall (approximately -13% to 2,089 million), due to lower adjustments for stage
3 loans and for bad loans in particular. This performance was also influenced by the recoveries on performing
loans, which benefited from a better risk profile.

Other net provisions and net impairment losses on other assets increased overall to 254 million euro (187
million euro for 2018).

Other income, which includes realised profits (losses) on investments and income and expenses not strictly
linked to operations, amounted to 55 million euro, compared to 506 million euro for 2018, which included
the gain resulting from the signing of the agreement with Intrum for the strategic partnership regarding non-
performing loans (443 million euro).

Income from discontinued operations, amounting to 88 million euro (71 million euro in 2018 on a like-for-like
basis), reflected the income effects, before tax, of the acquiring business line that will be transferred to Nexi in
2020 under the agreement signed with regard to the payment systems.
