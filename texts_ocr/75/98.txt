Clothing

The Golden Links project aims to support people in difficulty with regard to one of their most sensitive
needs, clothing — especially underwear and shoes — which can be difficult even for NPOs specialising in
the collection of clothes to obtain.

Started as an experiment in Piedmont and Veneto in 2018, last year it became a national initiative.
The Project creates a real national chain of solidarity which, on the Bank's initiative, involves Caritas
Italiana, the diocesan Caritas network (Turin, Vicenza, Naples, Potenza, Oria) and S-Nodi, a body set
up by Caritas to promote innovation in initiatives to combat poverty.

Next to them, four major clothing and footwear companies, customers of the Bank: Calzedonia, Scarpe
& Scarpe, Camomilla Italia and Primadonna, which have donated about 67,000 items of clothing to the
initiative. The garments were assembled in 18,000 gift sets by five non-profit organisations: Cooperativa
Sociale M25, Il sole a mezzanotte, Cooperativa Zemer, Opera Barolo and Ambiente solidale.

At the packaging centres, the preparation of the sets for women, men and children was done by
marginalised women and prisoners thanks to the mediation of local non-profit organisations.

Gift sets were given to marginalised families assisted by Caritas networks in Veneto, Piedmont,
Campania, Puglia, Basilicata and Calabria.

It is an innovative action that networks the best experiences of profit and non-profit partner institutions.
Medicines

Healthcare poverty affects an increasing number of people who do not have sufficient income to afford
adequate care. In Italy, poor people spend only 117 euro a year on medicines compared to 703 euro
spent by wealthy people. Indeed, an average of 64,000 tonnes of medicines are wasted with a disposal
cost of 96 million euro.

The Bank has established a four-year collaboration (2018-2021) with Fondazione Banco Farmaceutico
to boost the collection of unused and unexpired medicines donated to pharmacies and their free
distribution to charitable organisations that care for the needy.

The project envisages the start-up of new centres of Banco Farmaceutico in 12 cities, particularly in
areas of severe socio-economic deprivation. The business plan and the collection and distribution model
underlying the project allow for the autonomous sustainability of the centres set up.

In 2019, the collaboration allowed the distribution of more than 82,000 medicines and the launch of the
initiative Recupero Farmaci validi (Recovery of Valid Medicines) in three new cities, Perugia, Padua and
Matera, in addition to Ancona, Naples and Palermo where the project was already operational.
