Intesa Sanpaolo Group
Independent auditors’ report on the consolidated non-financial statement
31 December 2019

Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us
to believe that the 2019 consolidated non-financial statement of the Intesa Sanpaolo
Group has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the
requirements of articles 3 and 4 of the decree and the GRI Standards.
