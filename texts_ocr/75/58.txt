NON DISCRIMINATION 103-2/103-3; 406-1; AUDIT 103-2; ANTI-CORRUPTION 103-3; 205-1; EX FS9 AUDIT 103-2; EX FS9 Governance and management of risks

There is no evidence of cases of discrimination that have led to investigations for measures to be issued
under formal procedures or processes. Ongoing monitoring has also been conducted on compliance with the
rules laid down by the Internal Code of Conduct, through carrying out investigations of potentially abnormal
situations. Amendments to the same Code and initiatives aimed at more effective knowledge dissemination
with a view to risk prevention are being studied.

AUDITS

The planning of Audits is coordinated by a specific internal structure, which supports the Chief Audit Officer in
setting and assigning medium/short term objectives and plans to the Auditing Responsibility Centres, which
are internal structures focused on specific sectors (e.g. head office functions, ITC, branch network, product
companies, etc.). This activity takes into account the findings from risk analysis, the requests from the Company
Management and Control Bodies, and from Top Management, as well as the obligations arising from external
regulations and instructions from the Supervisory Authorities. In terms of timing, the planning is divided into:

* Multi-year Strategic Planning: in line with the company's strategic guidelines;
* Annual Operational Planning: annual audit plan, subject to approval by the Bodies;
* Quarterly Operational Planning.

As required by international standards, the Internal Audit function is subject to an external Quality Assurance
Review at least every five years. The most recent audit was started at the end of 2018, at the request of the
Management Control Committee, and was concluded in the first quarter of 2019 with the confirmation of the best
result (“Generally Compliant”). In addition, on an annual basis, the Internal quality assurance and improvement
plan is prepared, which also includes the Annual Plan submitted for approval to the Corporate Bodies. At
the international level, the audits are structured in such a way as to ensure the direct monitoring of Intesa
Sanpaolo’s international branches, in addition to guaranteeing supervision of the Head Office Departments
and the International Subsidiary Banks Division. For these banks, the dedicated offices of the Parent Company
provide direct auditing, together with governance of the activities carried out by local audit units.

With regard to the audits carried out in 2019 in the Head Office Departments, Banks and Group Companies, the
activities regarding the 230 Risk Areas identified in the planning phase were completed, with the completion of
252 audits (52 of which "extraordinary", i.e. originating from specific requests of Corporate Bodies, Supervisory
Authorities or from events/circumstances occurring after the completion of the annual planning). In 2019, 90
audits were reported as significant for the purposes of Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001, and among these
18 concerned activities related to corruption risk. These latest audits involved 9 Governance Areas/Divisions*.
In 2019, there were 15 audits regarding actions that directly or indirectly also related to aspects linked to
social and environmental policies. The impact of audits that have an effect on the implementation of social
and environmental policies should nevertheless be assessed differently depending on the various areas in
question: as an example, interventions concerning the disbursement and management of loans may also
involve certain aspects related to rules for operations in sectors such as arms and energy policies.

In July 2019 it was made possible to specify on the "Tableau de Bord" (a tool that summarises the critical
issues facing the Banking Group) the "sensitivity" of an individual point of attention that emerged during an
audit to issues concerning Corporate and Social Responsibility.

Following on from the Internal Audit Transformation (IAT) project completed at the end of 2017, the new
development programme called FAST - Future Audit Solutions & Transformation (an integral part of the
broader Multiannual Audit Plan) continues, aimed at improving reporting, identifying solutions focused on the
strategic aspects of the internal control system and ensuring the proactive management of the corrective
actions suggested after audits.

 

* 2 Governance Areas had only 1 audit, the others at least 2. Some audits involved several Divisions/Governance Areas.
