For the purposes of NPS in 2019, responses from approximately 820,000 Retail and Personal customers and
approximately 45,000 Businesses were analysed.

NPS by customer type 2019
Retail 20
Personal 7
Businesses 11

Findings collected from the Banca dei Territori Division customers.
In 2019 it was established that the survey channel of reference is the telephone. Therefore, the 2019 NPS is calculated by applying a correction that makes it possible to make the
votes collected through different channels comparable with those gathered by telephone.

The 2019 NPS for Retail and Personal customers is respectively 20 and 7 points.

For Corporate customers, the 2019 figure of 11 is affected by the inclusion in the survey of customers that, due
to the Bank's choice to change the Service Model at the beginning of 2019, have undergone a change of Branch
and/or Manager. Net of the latter, the NPS would be 19.

It should be noted that in 2019, for the first time, for all commercial areas, customers of the aggregate group of
former Banca Popolare di Vicenza and former Veneto Banca ("former Banche Venete") were also included in
NPS calculations.

include the measurement, through a summary index, of the overall satisfaction level (CSI - Customer Satisfaction Index).
