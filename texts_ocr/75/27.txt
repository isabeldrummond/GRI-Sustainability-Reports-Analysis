Materiality analysis

Non-financial and sustainability reporting focuses on key aspects that reflect the impacts, positive or negative,
generated by the Group’s activities in the economic, social and environmental sphere which are capable of
significantly influencing the stakeholders’ perception of it. As well as constituting the core of non-financial and
sustainability reporting, these aspects are also crucial for identifying and managing risks and opportunities,
also contributing to shaping the company’s strategy with regard to relevant issues for the business and its
stakeholders. To this end, in line with the process outlined in the GRI Standards, Intesa Sanpaolo updates its
Materiality analysis on an annual basis by performing the following steps and activities:

« identification of relevant issues for the company and for stakeholders;

« prioritisation of issues and definition of the materiality matrix;

« validation of the materiality matrix.

IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL ISSUES AND STAKEHOLDERS

Intesa Sanpaolo has identified the priority issues for the company and for its stakeholders through a documentary
analysis that is periodically updated. The main documents considered are:

internal document sources, including the 2018-2021 Business Plan, the Code of Ethics, the Sustainability
Reports / Consolidated Non-financial Statements of the last three years, the communications of the top
management, the minutes of the Shareholders' Meetings and company policies;

external documents, including: reference standards and frameworks for sustainability reports (AA1000, GRI
Standards, <IR>, SASB, Guidelines on reporting climate-related information), international documents linked
to sustainability issues (Agenda 2030, COP24, SDGs, European Commission Action Plan on sustainable
finance, Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, Principles for
responsible banking) and the main regulations in the sector (pursuant to Legislative Decree 254/2016);
Sustainability Reports/Consolidated Non-financial Statements of other Italian and international financial
groups;

documents drafted by national and international institutions for the identification of general and specific
megatrends in the banking sector.

In 2019, in particular, the documentary analysis focused on the Action Plan on financing sustainable growth, on
the communication from the European Commission published in March 2018, and on the related documents
made available during 2019 (Taxonomy, Report on EU Green Bond Standards, Report on climate benchmarks
and non-binding Guidelines on climate reporting).

In 2019, the previously identified material issues in response to the requests contained in Legislative Decree
254/2016 were essentially confirmed. In order to provide clear definitions to all stakeholders, these issues were
described (see outline on page 215) with their meaning to Intesa Sanpaolo clearly explained. Finally, the issues
were evaluated in terms of priority, related risks, areas of priority action and specific actions.

The stakeholders identified by Intesa Sanpaolo as representative of the Bank's relational universe are shown on
page 150.

PRIORITISATION OF ISSUES AND DEFINITION OF MATERIALITY MATRIX

In order to evaluate the priority of each theme, both the interests of the company with respect to the objectives
and corporate strategies, reported on the "Impact on strategies" axis of the Materiality Matrix, and those of the
stakeholders with respect to their expectations and needs, reported on the “Importance for stakeholders" axis
of the same Matrix.

In both cases, the issues were assessed using a scale of 1-5, where 1 indicates that the company strategies
or stakeholders have minimal interest in the issue, and 5 indicates that they have maximum interest.

The results of the “stakeholder engagement” process (see page 151) were used when updating the stakeholder
axis. The results were classified on the basis of Intesa Sanpaolo’s issues and weighted according to the
stakeholder’s relevance for the Bank.

The strategies axis was built as follows:

documentary analysis: in order to highlight any aspects, including in the ESG context, to which the Group
paid particular attention, the press releases and company policies published in 2019 as the voice of the
company's management were analysed.

update of the strategy axis: the values assigned to the axis in 2018 were updated based on the results of the
documentary analysis taking into consideration that, in 2018, the matrix had been built by paying particular
attention to the commitments defined in the 2018-2021 Business Plan.
