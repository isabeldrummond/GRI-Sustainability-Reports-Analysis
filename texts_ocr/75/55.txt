Governance and management of risks

the principles or with the aims of the legal system in the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates,
both due to outside factors (primarily, uncertainty of the interpretation of tax laws due to ambiguity or lack of
clarity of tax regulations) and internal factors (usually, incorrect and/or untimely compliance with mandatory
requirements, failure to detect regulatory changes affecting the taxation of the Group; and transactions that
may be challenged by the tax authorities as abusive).

The Principles are:

* Corporate Responsibility - The Group, in compliance with the Corporate Responsibility principle, acts
according to the values of honesty and integrity in the management of tax matters, in the knowledge
that revenue from taxes is one of the main sources of resources contributing to the economic and social
development of the countries in which it operates.

« Legality - The Group adopts conduct based on compliance with the tax regulations applicable in the countries
in which it operates and on interpretations that allow it to manage tax risk responsibly, so that it can satisfy
the interests of all its stakeholders and ensure its positive reputation.

* Tone at the top - The Board of Directors defines the principles of conduct in relation to Group tax matters
and ensures its application, therefore assuming the responsibility of driving the spread of a corporate culture
based on the values of honesty and integrity and principle of lawfulness.

* Relationship - The Group maintains a collaborative and transparent relationship with the tax authorities,
guaranteeing, among other things, to provide them the information needed to fully understand the
circumstances underlying the application of tax rules. To this end, Intesa Sanpaolo encourages the Group
companies to adhere to cooperative compliance schemes, which supplement the national regulations, in
order to create stronger relationships with the tax authorities.

The Guidelines were also approved for the management of tax risk within the collaborative compliance scheme
with the Italian Revenue Agency, which govern the criteria and processes that Intesa Sanpaolo must adopt to
ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of its Tax Control Framework, as well as the related Rules.

The types of tax risk that may arise in the context of business processes have been identified by Intesa
Sanpaolo as:

* Tax compliance risks. These are risks of an operational nature and arise in both business processes (such
as risks of not correctly performing all the operational tasks necessary to ensure correctness — in terms of
completeness, accuracy and timely processing — of the relevant data for tax purposes), and in specific tax
compliance processes (from data collection through to its processing and preparation of tax declarations/
payments and communications sent to the tax authorities);

* Tax risks of an interpretative nature in transactions/routine operations. This type of risk relates to the uncertainty
about the actual meaning of the regulations and the classification of actual cases with respect to theoretical
circumstances, and arises within the following processes: regulatory alignment, advice given to the Structures
of the Bank and interpretation choices adopted in tax compliance processes;

* Tax risks of an interpretative nature in non-routine transactions. These risks arise whenever non-routine
transactions/operations are carried out, which are characterised by objective and defined uncertainty regarding
the risk of adopting incorrect interpretations or, in any case, interpretations that are contrary to the principles
and aims of the tax system.

Based on the periodic reports and other information flows provided by the Tax structure and the other corporate
control functions, and checks conducted directly, the Compliance, Governance and Controls Head Office
Department produces an independent assessment of the regulatory non-compliance risk in relation to tax
matters and the adequacy of controls put in place for its mitigation, and, when it deems necessary, it requests
the Tax structure to implement appropriate strengthening measures.

During 2019', the Group, in addition to indirect taxes of 895 million euro, recorded accrued income taxes for
the year of 1,838 million euro, for the most part in Italy, where the majority of operating income was earned,
as per the table below.

these branches are located. As far as taxes on income are concerned, since Intesa Sanpaolo did not apply the
option for the scheme of income exemption for international branches (known as Branch exemption), these
