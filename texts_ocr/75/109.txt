WHY THESE ISSUES ARE RELEVANT

Like the previous plan, the 2018-2021 Business Plan identifies the Group’s employees as key for the
consolidation and continuing growth of the Bank. Thanks to their professionalism, their range of expertise
and their growth paths, together with the important technological investments launched to ensure they
are ready for the digital challenge, the people of Intesa Sanpaolo contribute to ensuring the excellent
quality of customer services and the fulfilment of the Plan’s goals.

The importance of the Group’s people is evident in the company’s full protection of workers’ rights
with particular regard for the development of labour relations and employment protection, its personnel
development activities, promoting training and merit, its concrete development policies and measures,
and its enhancement of a modern and integrated company welfare system. In addition, since some time
Intesa Sanpaolo has also adhered to an Occupational Health and Safety Management System compliant
with the most advanced international standards. The programmes adopted, also thanks to the numerous
agreements signed with the trade unions, have made it possible to effectively protect employment levels
through professional retraining activities, but also with the introduction and consolidation of numerous
innovative contractual tools, that are able to foster the development of an effective company welfare
system and establish a better work-life balance.
