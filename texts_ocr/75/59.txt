DISPUTES AND FINES

As at 31 December 2019, a total of about 22,000 disputes, other than tax disputes, were pending at Group
level for a total amount of around 5,635 million euro. This amount includes all outstanding disputes, regardless
of the estimated risk of a disbursement of financial resources resulting from a potential negative outcome and
therefore also includes disputes with a remote risk. The risks associated with these disputes are thoroughly
and individually analysed by the Parent Company and Group companies.

In terms of tax litigation, there were disputes pending amounting to a total of 365 million euro for the Group.
With regard to compliance with environmental regulations, for damage caused to the environment as a result
of the Bank's operations and in relation to health and safety, over the last three years, no significant reports
emerged and no fines were imposed (see page 160).

With regard to labour litigation, at the end of December 2018 there were no significant disputes from either a
qualitative or quantitative standpoint.

For information on the legal risks and the most significant civil, administrative and penal lawsuits, please refer
