RELEVANT ISSUES

The Intesa Sanpaolo Group has always been committed to protecting human rights, in line with the values set out
in the Code of Ethics.

Aware that its activities have direct and indirect impacts on human rights, Intesa Sanpaolo has defined its areas
of responsibility for each of its stakeholders. Indeed, it has considered its impact on its employees, customers,
suppliers and the community. The environment is another issue closely related to the principles of human rights,
and the promotion of high environmental standards must therefore be considered key to respecting and enjoying
these rights.

As a cross-cutting issue that is relevant to various areas of the Group’s operations, human rights are therefore
touched upon throughout the Consolidated Non-financial Statement, as summarised in the following table:

WHY THESE ISSUES ARE RELEVANT

According to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, approved in 2011, the State has
a duty to protect human rights and businesses must respect them wherever they operate (regardless of
the ability or willingness of States to fulfil their obligations). Victims of abuse must also be able to access
appropriate and effective remedies.

Indeed, through their activities businesses can have various types of impacts on human rights: positive
ones, such as the supply of innovative services that improve people’s quality of life; or negative ones,
including the exploitation of workers, for example, or the forced displacement of people or entire
communities. Businesses can also be indirectly involved in violations committed by other businesses or
States.

In its role as an intermediary, a financial institution like Intesa Sanpaolo initiates a value chain that involves
many different individuals, entities, businesses and States. For this reason, as well as observing the
relevant legislation in force in all countries in which it operates, it is committed to identifying, mitigating
and, where possible, preventing potential violations of human rights connected with its activities, as
recommended by the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
