2 The figures differ from those of the income statement in the annual report due to the exclusion of unrealised gains/losses, now recognised in a separate item.

3 The figures differ from those of the income statement in the annual report due to the exclusion of indirect taxes and donations and gifts, and taxes and other charges regarding the banking
industry, now recognised in a separate item. As of 2019, in application of IFRS 16, leasing payments are no longer included, since the charge is represented through the amortisation of the
asset relating to the right of use and as interest expense on the debt.
