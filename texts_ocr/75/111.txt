Employment protection

COMPANY POLICIES

The company’s approach to managing issues relating to the protection of workers’ rights is outlined in
the Code of Ethics, which recognises the principles established by the fundamental conventions of the
ILO (International Labour Organization) and in particular the right to freedom of association and collective
bargaining, the abolition of forced and child labour, and non-discrimination in employment. The applied
collective bargaining system works on two separate and complementary levels: the first at national level
and the second at company level for the Intesa Sanpaolo Group (second-level contractual structure).
The labour relations model, adopted and developed by the Group together with the Trade Unions, has
promoted dialogue between the parties on a continuous basis. The model is a way of identifying the most
suitable solutions and tools for addressing and managing the various growth and reorganisation phases
that have marked the company’s activities over the years, including those involved in the implementation of
the 2018-2021 Business Plan. Concrete evidence of this can be seen in the creation and work of bilateral
Company/Union bodies, formed with the aim of analysing, identifying and proposing positive actions,
solutions and tools in the areas of equal opportunities, welfare, safety and sustainable development.

JOB PROTECTION

For Intesa Sanpaolo, job protection is a priority issue for guaranteeing its mid- to long-term financial solidity,
and is also one of the key topics underlying the 2018-2021 Business Plan. The development of labour policies
is entrusted to a specific structure in the Chief Operating Officer Governance Area, which has the task of
drawing up union agreements and monitoring their implementation.

As regards the signed agreements, the strategic measures defined in 2018 include the voluntary departure
of 1,600 employees by June 2021 - in addition to the 9,000 by June 2020 already outlined in the 2018-2021
Business Plan - and specific active employment policies to support the growth of the business and facilitate
generational change. In 2019 the Group workforce turnover rate was -3.27%, in line with the structural measures
planned. Employment within the Group was also guaranteed by the gradual extension of the new mixed
contract (around 150 people hired and 200 traineeships activated), a working method whereby individuals
possess two separate contracts, one permanent part-time employee contract and one as a self-employed
financial advisor for out-of-branch activities. In addition, as part of the NEXT project (‘Nuove esperienze per te’)
a reskilling training process was launched which provides support during the change process and in new roles.
In fact, the 2018-2021 Business Plan has identified important staff renewal goals and focuses close attention
on channelling excess capacity towards priority goals. To achieve these a dedicated initiative was launched
(Proactive HR “In-Placement”) to reallocate at least ~5,000 people to activities of greater value added. In
