PROMOTION OF CULTURE FOR SOCIAL COHESION

Intesa Sanpaolo views its commitment to social responsibility, contributing to both the economic and the
cultural and civil growth of the country. The objective is achieved by Progetto Cultura, on the one hand by
promoting the enjoyment of its important artistic, architectural, editorial and documentary heritage (over 30,000
works from the 5th century BC through to the 20th century, including masterpieces by Caravaggio, Canaletto,
Boccioni, Fontana, Manzoni, over 20 prestigious buildings) and on the other hand aims to contribute to the
preservation of the country's cultural heritage.

Consistent with this approach, the Bank’s Articles of Association entrust the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
after consultation with the Managing Director and according to the Guidelines approved by the Board, with the
planning and management of the cultural initiatives of the Company and Group, with particular reference to the
promotion of historic, archaeological and artistic heritage; in this role, the Chairman has a cooperative relation
with the Chairman Emeritus.

The Guidelines approved by the Board of Directors became effective in 2009 with Progetto Cultura, the Bank's
strategic container for cultural activities.

With a three-year plan, Progetto Cultura identifies and plans the interventions carried out independently or
in partnership with other public and private entities (museums, foundations, universities, public institutions,
and theatre and music companies) and is managed by the Art, Culture and Historical Heritage Head Office
Department.Its collaborations with leading European and international museums and cultural institutions - with
exchanges of works, academic analyses and mutual promotions - underline its desire to extend its commitment
to all those places, in Europe and the world, that share the Group’s values and understand the importance of
preserving and promoting the artistic and cultural heritage of the countries involved.

The Bank's artistic heritage is promoted in various ways: through the study and scientific cataloguing of the
works; restoration activities; museum projects for permanent displays of part of the collections in the museums
of the Gallerie d'Italia, the planning and organisation of temporary exhibitions; support for training and research
scholarships for students on the works of the corporate collection in collaboration with universities; and the
loaning of works to temporary exhibitions.

As part of the fair value measurement of the carrying amount of valuable art assets in 2019, a scenario analysis
was carried out in accordance with the valuation rules applied by the Group relating to the annual performance
of the national and international art market, with particular regard to the prices of the works/collections with
higher values in the Group's asset register, equal to around 75% of the total value of the valuable art assets
(which today counts 3,500 works). The complex process of the fair value measurement of the carrying amount
of valuable art assets will continue over time and will be made available to parties such as research bodies,
universities and the media as a best practice and fundamental component of the social and civil responsibility
mission that Intesa Sanpaolo pursues as part of Progetto Cultura.

Important exhibitions were held in the three museums of the Gallerie d'Italia in 2019:
