Relations with the community

COMPANY POLICIES

The Group plays an active role in the areas in which it operates. The Code of Ethics draws attention
to the requirements and needs of the community: this commitment consists of various activities which
tangibly contribute to achieving sustainable development goals at a global level, such as the promotion
of solidarity initiatives with projects set up through partnerships, donations, the sponsorship of important
cultural and social initiatives, and the protection and promotion of the historical, artistic and cultural
heritage of both Italy and the Group so that it can be enjoyed by the public as well.

With the 2018-2021 Business Plan, the Group intends to become an increasingly important exemplary
model for society, developing key projects such as:

« Intesa Sanpaolo programme for people in difficulty, which entails the extension of the "Cibo e Riparo
per le persone in difficolta" ("Food and Shelter for disadvantaged people") initiative to guarantee
10,000 meals a day (3.6 million a year), 6,000 beds a month (72,000 a year), 3,000 medicines and
3,000 clothing items a month (36,000 drugs and 36,000 items of clothing a year) to people in need;

* Intesa Sanpaolo for culture, with the creation of a specialist unit for the promotion and proactive
management of artistic, cultural and historical heritage to champion art and culture in Italy and abroad.

Projects and activities are promoted by the Group in order to respond effectively to the most important
needs of communities, taking into account the objectives of the major international and national, public
and private institutions that contribute to the determination of social policies. Actions are increasingly
undertaken in collaboration with local entities and institutions in order to have a positive social impact.
In line with the Group’s core values, actions are carried out in accordance with the transparency and
accountability criteria, and by implementing processes and procedures that aim to avoid any possible
personal or business conflict of interest.
