pages 186. In general,
there no differences
between the benefits
provided to full-time
employees and those
provided to part-time
employees. For employees
with a fixed-term contract,
due to the nature of the
contract itself, access to
the Healthcare Fund and
to ALI is not permitted,
whereas access to the
Group's Supplementary
Pension Fund is permitted
to a very limited extent.

Retention rate under privacy constrain.
Because of the variety and the
complexity of available parental
leaves, in order to calculate the
indicator an individual monitoring
would be necessary, thus breaching
the employees' privacy rights.

Part of the information is not available:
the data and information relating to
injuries of non-employee workers are
not monitored as the Italian regulations

all the significance of implementing

a specially designed collection and
monitoring system and making said
information available as from 2025 will
be assessed.
