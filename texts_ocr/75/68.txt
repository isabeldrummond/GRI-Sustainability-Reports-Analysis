DIGITALISATION, INNOVATION AND ACCESSIBILITY
THE DIGITALISATION PROCESSES PAVING THE WAY TOWARDS AN INTEGRATED MULTICHANNEL BANK

Intesa Sanpaolo is continuing to transform the Group into a digital company, anticipating and supporting the
needs and actions of customers in order to increasingly develop their “remote” relations with the Bank. Indeed,
the main goals of the 2018-2021 Business Plan entail progressive digitalisation involving ongoing interaction
with customers and employees, high-impact innovation with the building of the Group’s innovation brand, and
support for the development of businesses and the implementation of IT systems and processes to ensure
they are digital ready. At the same time, plans are in place to strengthen the operating structure with new skills
to maintain its high levels of efficiency in an approach which genuinely combines the business and IT worlds.
In this regard, an in-depth review of the IT platform is ongoing, continuing to focus on cybersecurity and
expansion on the multichannel nature of customer services concentrating on the use of mobile devices.
Thanks to the progress Intesa Sanpaolo has made in the area of multichannel and digital banking activities, it
has already achieved notable results in terms of customer engagement and the volume of services offered. In
Italy (excluding Fideuram Intesa Sanpaolo Private banking and Banca 5) the main results were:

* About 9.2 million multichannel customers (8.3 million in 2018), equalling more than 78% of customers;

17.2 million digitised transactions (33 million since 2018) and 35% of activities digitised (17.8% in 2018);
6.1 million customers connected at least once to digital channels (Internet Banking and Mobile App) in 2019,
including 5.5 million from 2018 to the new App (+38% compared to 2018);

32 Group companies already introduced into the Cybersecurity Model (76%);

66.4 million average monthly accesses via App, with 48 million transactions carried out in 2019 (in 2018 there
were approximately 26 million transactions);

5.7 million customers have activated the new access systems that are simpler and safer than a physical flash
drive key (compliant with the requirements of the European Directive on Payment Services in the Internal
Market PSD2, Payments Service Directive 2), i.e. the O-key Smart or the O-key SMS (OTP - One-Time
Password software);

about 85% of the retail customer product range available via multichannel platforms (including the current
account, payment cards and personal loans);

about 500,000 active customers already reached with the launch of the Intesa Sanpaolo Investo App and
almost 40% of online trading transactions carried out by Banca dei Territori retail customers.

With a similar innovative drive, the relationship with business and corporate customers is also evolving digitally
thanks to a multi-year transformation programme and a new portal for companies, with:

320,000 companies migrated to the new digital portal and 20 million transactions per month, corresponding
to 140 billion euro per month transacted;

350,000 users (employees of customer companies) with new access credentials, highly reliable in terms of
Cyber Security and based either on the use of Smartphones or digital QR Code readers;

170,000 users who use the New Inbiz app, which allows them to approve millions of transactions per month,
even via mobile, or to consult the balances and transactions of all the accounts of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group
and other banks;

20,000 customers activated on the new digital tool Corporate Treasury (Treasury Management System to
support Corporate Treasurers as they monitor and plan Working Capital);

25,000 customers activated on the new Customer Journey Export (working area to support companies with
Trade Export needs).

The main innovations in the digital area in 2019 concerned:

the development of new customer journeys (sales processes) with a multi-channel logic to improve the product
line and customer experience, with an expansion of the products sold through Internet Banking, app and Intesa
Sanpaolo Mobile, via self-service and Remote Offers;

a series of new functions identified as priorities to remain European best practices, like improving the OCR (optical
character recognition) function on the app to allow the payment of F24 tax forms and bill payment slips from
the app or the release on app and Internet Banking of the notification dashboard, for real-time monitoring of
transactions on Accounts, Cards and Investments;

digital payments over 700,000 XME Pay active, the digital portfolio of the Intesa Sanpaolo Mobile app and the
dematerialisation of payment cards on mobile devices by integrating all the main solutions available on the market,
as well as the extension of the possibility of dematerialising the card to the national debit card circuit;
