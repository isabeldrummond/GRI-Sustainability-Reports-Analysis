alignment, in addition to compliance with the provisions of the Italian Data Protection Authority. This structure
conducts prior assessments on the compliance of new products, initiatives and services involving the processing
of personal data, and represents the Company before the Italian Data Protection Authority during inspection
procedures.

The Data Protection Officer assesses the role performed by the Group's suppliers/Third Parties based on the
provisions for the processing of personal data contained in the contracts, and supports the business and support
structure in preparing any letters of appointment as Data Processor, and in updating the Register of Processing
Activities. It also updates and publishes the List of Third Parties that process the personal data of customers and
employees. The Data Protection Officer manages the responses to the Italian Data Protection Authority and the
interested parties, following reports or complaints submitted to the Authority. It also processes customer requests
associated with Data Subjects’ rights in compliance with the legal provisions and the measures issued by the
Authority, and oversees training on privacy, in collaboration with the designated structures through the provision
of mandatory training courses on the protection of personal data offered online.

For the other Group Companies, the Data Protection Officer performs a role of guidance, coordination and
control, overseeing the correct application of the Group guidelines and regulations on privacy, and provides
support and advice for the performance of the current activities in this area. For the Group, it ensures control of
the non-compliance risk in relation to privacy regulations, performing the role of Specialist Function set out in
the Group Compliance Guidelines. The Function updates the Register of Processing Activities for personal data
performed by the Parent Company, with the cooperation of the business and support functions, and provides
assistance with regard to other Group companies.

This commitment allows for the mitigation of reputational and non-compliance risks in the processing of personal
data, also with respect to the lawfulness and fairness of the processing, the purposes of the processing and its
relevance, and the completeness and non-excessive nature of the data collected.

With regard to requests received from customers regarding personal data protection, in Italy 77 reports were
received in 2019 for alleged instances of non-compliance (59 of which related to Intesa Sanpaolo) and 9 requests
from the Italian Data Protection Authority regarding companies belonging to the Group, for which the necessary
responses were given. In 2019, 17 cases (13 of which related to Intesa Sanpaolo) of loss or theft of data of
customers of the Group (Data Breach) were assessed in Italy, 15 of which (11 related to Intesa Sanpaolo) were
not found to pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects and therefore it was not necessary to
notify the Italian Data Protection Authority. For the remaining two cases it was deemed necessary to notify the
Italian Data Protection Authority’.

The Companies of the International Subsidiary Banks Division established in the European Union reported a
total of 28 incidents/events of alleged personal data breach, of which 2 reported to local authorities, while for
the remaining 26 the local Data Protection Officers did not detect a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data
subjects so it was not necessary to notify the respective Italian Data Protection Authority.

COMPLIANCE WITH LABOUR LAWS

Consistent with the commitment set out in the Code of Ethics for the development of a working environment
permeated by mutual trust, loyalty and enriched by the contribution of each person, the management model
in this area is based on national and second-level (Group) collective bargaining agreements. Compliance with
these rules, in addition to the legal provisions, is instrumental to improving the working environment, with a
view to continued growth in the quality of relations between the Company and its personnel and customers.
They also have the goal of asserting the need for a transparent and sustainable work organisation, with
clear operational responsibilities at the various levels to continuously ensure compliance with the rules and
the prevention of non-compliant behaviour, identifying measures that ensure the effective encapsulation of
company objectives and worker expectations in terms of the working environment and internal relations.
Responsibility for management, and consequently also for monitoring the effective application of the trade
union agreements, is assigned to the Trade Union Affairs and Labour Policies Head Office Department. The
protocol for Labour Relations enables joint research and sharing between the Company and Trade Union
Organisations on solutions to improve the well-being of employees and make a positive contribution to
productivity with advanced and innovative responses in the area of pensions, assistance and services for
families, education and an improved work-life balance. The aims of the actions include improving the work-
life balance for the employees. In general, the number of labour lawsuits is small: 34 cases for violations of
labour law were notified in 2019 and around 42 cases were closed. The main types of litigation initiated include
the termination of employment relationships — sale of business unit (Intrum), compensation for damages for
deskilling and mobbing, higher job positions and appeals of disciplinary sanctions (in any event in 2019, no
lawsuits were reported by current employees that related solely to cases of mobbing).

Italian Data Protection Authority; 1 case of Data Breach which involved Intesa Sanpaolo as Data Controller and the DPO notified the Italian Data Protection Authority.
