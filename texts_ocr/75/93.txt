of medical treatment is guaranteed, and the need to be able to access medical care is at the top of their
priorities, especially for younger people.

The challenge is to work on customer awareness, adding a further piece to the product range: the protection of
risks and contingencies for which Italians still rely too much on cash. Insuring families and businesses against
damage is also important for the country's economic growth because it triggers a virtuous circle and makes it
more solid.

In September 2019 the Insurance Division inaugurated Area X, the first physical space dedicated to the
promotion of insurance culture in Italy. With technological innovations like virtual reality and holograms, visitors
are immersed in interactive experiences that allow them to experience concrete everyday life situations where,
after unforeseen events, they can learn the value of the right insurance protection.

OFFERING OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS

During 2019, the Insurance Division revised its product and service model for all business lines to meet
customer needs with respect to sustainability issues.

With regard to the Life business, Intesa Sanpaolo Vita has enriched the financial offering of the Open Pension
Fund "II Mio Domani" with 3 new ESG benchmark sub-funds. In addition, a new fully-ESG Life Cycle investment
profile has been introduced, which provides for the allocation of the most consistent starting sub-fund based on
the time horizon missing at the date of retirement.

There are also several products with high social value: Tu Dopo di Noi is an insurance product created for
families of disabled people who wish to protect their loved one by accumulating a safe capital to be allocated
in the future. Base Sicura Tutelati is instead dedicated exclusively to minors and/or incapacitated people who
have capital to be used and who need the prior authorisation of a guardianship.

In November, Fideuram Vita launched the internal fund Orizzonte Responsabile, whose investment universe
includes ESG financial instruments or themed funds that propose concrete solutions for sustainable
development.

A selection of external ESG funds has also been introduced, with around 20 UCIls fully invested according to
ESG criteria available in the Fideuram Vita Insieme family of products.

Finally, with regard to the Fideuram Pension Fund, the investment policy has been revised by introducing
criteria for sustainable and responsible investment that are linked to ESG factors.

As far as the Non-life business is concerned, Intesa Sanpaolo Assicura has launched XME Protezione, a
modular product to protect against risks related to family life, health and home, which can also be extended
to cover the family unit, with the possibility of adding protection against the consequences of floods and
earthquakes. In just over a year on the market this insurance solution has already been selected by 520,000
customers.

The car insurance product ViaggiaConMe was designed to promote a sustainable use of the car through
different solutions based on the kilometres actually travelled, allowing a savings to the customer of up to 50%.
At the end of 2019 a contest was launched among policyholders awarding an electric/hybrid car.

THE CULTURE OF SUSTAINABILITY IN THE INSURANCE DIVISION

To promote a culture of sustainability, in September 2019 a specific Sustainability Section was created in the
Myinsurance portal, where all employees have easy access to online courses dedicated to environmental
issues and all updates on the Division's sustainability projects and actions. In 2019 all the people in the
Insurance Division were invited to access "Our Commitment to the Environment", a collection of 12 learning
modules available on the Apprendo platform. Training related to the ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 environmental
certification of the building in Viale Stelvio in Milan. A "green questionnaire" was also developed with the
aim of gauging the level of awareness of the issues of environmental sustainability and health and safety at
work, also useful for gathering ideas to initiate any further awareness-raising actions related to environmental
issues. Also in 2019, a first training session on ESG issues was carried out as part of the project developed on
sustainability for the top management of the Insurance Group.

With the aim of further promoting the spread and awareness of a culture focused on innovation and customer
needs, in addition to supporting the Business in defining evolutionary plans and new initiatives, a monitoring
structure dedicated to innovation trends in the insurance sector was launched with discussions open to all
colleagues in the Division, dedicated analyses of specific topics or meetings with market experts. As part of its
programmes to disseminate insurance culture and skills, the Insurance Group is launching a Level II Master’s
degree in Insurance Innovation in collaboration with the University of Turin, Turin Polytechnic (POLITO) and
Collegio Carlo Alberto. The Master’s degree is for recent graduates and people with experience in the insurance
sector interested in expanding their knowledge of digital and innovative issues in the insurance sector and will
consist of fundamental and specialised modules. The first edition will be proposed starting in the fall of 2020.
