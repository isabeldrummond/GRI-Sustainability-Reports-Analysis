ASSESSMENT AND INCENTIVE SYSTEMS

In 2019 UpPER was adopted, a new performance assessment system designed to meet the new development
challenges and place the focus on every single individual, emphasising everybody's specific role and contribution.
UpPER is supported by an intuitive and easy to use digital system which forms part of a broader project to transform
and digitalise HR processes. The Performance Assessment is based on 3 indicators, shared between managers and
employees at the start of the year. In order to foster continuous dialogue, during the assessment cycle managers can
provide employees with feedback on the indicators that have been assigned, also thanks to the use of a specific app,
enabling them to receive notifications of training opportunities, in line with other skills mapping and training processes.
For the Group’s Risk Takers and Middle Management the assessment system adopted is known as Managers’
Performance Accountability and is based on transparent, objective and measurable qualitative and quantitative KPls
identified in accordance with the goals of the Business Plan and also useful for measuring managerial qualities.
Among the non-financial KPls for 2020, the CEO was assigned a Social and Environmental Impact KPI (Impact
& ESG KPI). This KPI will be evaluated according to specific drivers aimed at monitoring the issue from various
perspectives including the Group’s inclusion in the sustainability indexes of specialist companies, the support for the
Green and Circular Economy, the Group’s commitment to impact financing to foster inclusion and support for youth
employability (see the Report on the policy regarding remuneration), as well as the promotion of art and culture. The
Impact & ESG KPI is then declined within the organization, beginning with the CEO’s first line, on the basis of the
levers used by Risk Takers and the Middle Management.

As for the International Subsidiary Banks, the New Performance Appraisal Tool - NewPat, system that provides
performance evaluation, was launched. After its extension to all people in the head office departments in 2018, in
2019 a project was launched to review the incentive system for the people of the sales network in accordance with the
Group’s policies. This is expected to be implemented by the end of 2020.

In 2019 around 700 Group people (52% women, 48% men) were involved in managerial potential assessment days
with the aim of creating management development groups to be nurtured on an ongoing basis. Around 100 women
participated in a female talent promotion project in the Corporate & Investment Banking Division.

In accordance with the Business Plan, to maximise internal equity, external competitiveness and a culture of meritocracy,
Intesa Sanpaolo has consolidated the introduction of a system to map the organisational positions in the company
called Global Banding. Taking account of factors like complexity, type of influence and impact on the Group’s results
and strategy, Global Banding objectively evaluates the relative value of different organisational roles and represents in
a more organic and objective way - both externally and internally - the responsibilities of each Manager, also through
the adoption of an international title valid for managerial positions in Italy and abroad.

 

As for its Incentive Systems, the Group has both short-term and long-term Plans for the entire workforce. For the

Group’s Risk Takers and Middle Management there is an annual Incentive System connected with the Managers’

Performance Accountability system according to which a bonus is awarded upon the fulfilment of certain goals in

accordance with the rules outlined in the Remuneration and Incentive Policies.

As regards the rest of the workforce, in order to continue rewarding all employees for their contributions to achieving

the goals of the 2018-2021 Business Plan, second-level agreements were signed on 10 October 2019 for the pay-out

of the 2019 Variable Result Bonus (VRB) and the Protection Excellence System (PES), the latter of which dedicated

to Network staff involved in offering insurance products, in accordance with the goals of the Business Plan which

foresees strong investment in this sector. The aim of the 2019 VRB is to reward the increase in profitability and

productivity obtained by achieving the results of 2019, that are identified in the agreements in relation to the different

company levels of reference. Due to its variable nature, the 2019 VRB is a one-time bonus and the cash sum of the

reward recognised to every employee consists of three parts linked to specifically identified economic and financial

parameters and to specific clusters of Group employees:

* The basic bonus, for every company level, role or seniority level, is designed to reward individuals for the collective
contribution made, supporting those with lower salaries as part of an internal equality policy;

* The additional bonus that recognises the contribution made to the results of the relevant department and varies
according to role or seniority and professional category;

* The excellence bonus, which rewards individual merit and the distinctive contribution made to achieving the
