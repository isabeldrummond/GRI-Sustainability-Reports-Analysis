and landscapes requiring restoration work, by initiating the ninth census. In February 2019 the results of the
initiative were presented: more than 2.2 million Italians voted to give a future to the places dear to them, more
than 37,200 places reported, 6,412 municipalities involved (80.6% of Italian municipalities). Today the FAI
census has become one of the most surprising social aggregation tools in our country. Over the nine editions,
there have been 7.2 million reports made of sites, ranging greatly in type, across Italy. This is proof of an
increasing need to safeguard the historic heritage and identity of Italy. In November 2019, 27 new projects
involving the restoration, recovery and safeguarding were announced. This brings the total number of projects
financed thanks to the FAI census to 119, returning works of art and places to the community.

In 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo renewed its support for the "FAI Brumotti per I’Italia" project, a 17-stage, 1,600 km
cycling trip to discover the most beautiful parts of Italy and to celebrate art, culture and solidarity. An itinerary
travelling throughout the peninsula from North to South, organised by Vittorio Brumotti with FAI (the Italian
Environment Fund) in partnership with the Bank, which involved three significant stages: at the end of June
in Orvinio, one of the reported places not to be forgotten; then in Naples at the Pausilipon Children's Hospital
and finally in Matera, Culture Capital 2019, places that symbolise Intesa Sanpaolo's commitment to culture
and society.

Editorial and film-related initiatives were also promoted, such as Bookcity, Turin International Book Fair, La
Milanesiana, Torino Film Festival with the pre-opening event dedicated to Torino Citta del Cinema 2020, Capri
and Hollywood — The International Film Festival, Festivaletteratura of Mantua, Premio Campiello, Premio
Gambrinus - Giuseppe Mazzotti. As part of the cultural initiatives that the Bank has been carrying out for several
years in partnership with the City of Turin, in 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo also supported "Ripensare le biblioteche
civiche torinesi" (Rethinking Turin's Civic Libraries), a project for the renewal of Turin's civic libraries that
envisages the adoption of a new card and the inclusion of the library system in a circuit of partnerships with the
book and culture supply chain to strengthen its social impact, the redesign of its website and communications
on social channels, as well as the creation of a new graphic image.

Also for 2019, the partnership with the Trento Festival of Economics revolving around the theme "Globalisation,
nationalism and representation" was renewed, in order to reflect together with political and institutional
representatives on the interactions between political conflict and economic conflict, looking beyond the Italian
case and focusing on relevant changes in American economic policy and the uncertainties of European
economic and political unification.

For the fifth consecutive year, Intesa Sanpaolo also supported the Festival Citta Impresa ("Enterprise City")
in Vicenza. The event has become a place for debate on the issues of the economy and local communities:
each year the event turns the spotlight on the great Italian manufacturing cities, following and interpreting the
development trends and the great urban and anthropological transformations of local regions and production.
Intesa Sanpaolo also took part in the Limes Festival, which saw Italian and international experts coming
together in Genoa for three days of conferences and round tables on the most current geopolitical issues.

As evidence of its strong commitment to Southern Italy and Culture, the Bank was a Gold Partner of Matera
European Culture Capital 2019. Throughout 2019, Matera hosted a series of original and inclusive events,
exhibitions, workshops and cultural productions. The Bank's support was also evident in a programme of
events open to the public, organised in collaboration with some of the country's great names like Umbria Jazz,
Cameristi della Scala, Biennale Democrazia and Classica HD and with local personalities like the artist Pietro
Paolo Tarasco who was born there.

Intesa Sanpaolo supports research as a means to promote new economic and social development opportunities,
with collaborations with leading foundations and institutions, and also learning opportunities for young people
and for promoting the inclusion of women in the workplace. Along the same lines, there has also been the
collaboration with the Intercultural Centre of the City of Turin: the Centre provides training to first and second-
generation immigrants on issues forming the basis of intercultural relations, which can help bolster a sense of
community and belonging to the city. On a similar note, Intesa Sanpaolo has been working in cooperation with
Biennale Democrazia (Democracy Biennale), a permanent workshop on democratic practices and civilised
coexistence.

Finally, we would like to spotlight the Concert Giornata della memoria (Remembrance Day), an annual event
organised by the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory of Milan in collaboration with Associazione Figli della Shoah,
the Jewish Community, Fondazione Memoriale della Shoah and Fondazione CDEC for the "International
Holocaust Remembrance Day" celebrations. The Lideriadi choir performed Leonard Bernstein's "Chichester
Psalms", with the students of the Conservatory as orchestra, soloists and conductor.

Worthy of mention is the partnership with the Intercultura Foundation, which promotes and organises
international exchanges between young students. The Bank has partnered with the Intercultura Foundation
since 2004 to support the promotion of the culture of dialogue and the training of secondary school students in
a multicultural context through intercultural exchanges abroad, to experience a period of life and study abroad,
hosted by local families and attending the local school.
