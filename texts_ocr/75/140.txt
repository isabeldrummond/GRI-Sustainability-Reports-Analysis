SUSTAINABILITY BOND

In 2019 the new Sustainability Bond Framework was redacted ahead of the issue of the Sustainability Bond to
support (new or existing) loans and projects for the Green Economy, the Circular Economy and also for social
purposes. The Framework was prepared in line with the international standards drawn up by ICMA, in particular
with the (2018) Green Bond Principles, the (2018) Social Bond Principles and the (2018) Sustainability Bond
Guidelines.

In November 2019, Intesa Sanpaolo successfully completed the placement of the first Sustainability Bond
focused on the Circular Economy, intended to support the loans granted by the Bank under the 5 billion euro
credit plafond dedicated to the Circular Economy.

The 750 million euro issue, against a demand of over 3.5 billion euro, was mainly subscribed by institutional
investors: Asset Managers (75%), Banks and Private banking (10%), Public Entities (10%), Insurance and
Retirement Funds (4%).

Thanks to this issue, the Green Bond Ratio, the percentage of outstanding green bonds at the end of the year
out of the total amount of outstanding Senior Preferred and Covered Bonds intended for institutional investors
(five-year moving average), is equal to about 3.3%.
