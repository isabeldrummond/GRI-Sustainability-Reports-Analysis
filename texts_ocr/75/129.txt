Direct environmental impacts

COMPANY POLICIES

Intesa Sanpaolo's commitment to the environment takes the form of self-regulated environmental and
energy instruments that define the strategic and operational guidelines which underpin the Group’s
environmental protection initiatives and its efforts to reduce its environmental footprint. The Group’s
Code of Ethics and the Rules for environmental and energy policy, approved by the top management,
define the principles and Guidelines that regulate the environmental responsibility of the Group and
the monitoring of the direct and indirect impact of its activities. With reference to the direct impacts
on the environment, arising from the Bank's operations, some time ago, Intesa Sanpaolo adopted in
Italy an Integrated Health and Safety, Environmental and Energy Management System, implemented in
accordance with the most important reference international standards (ISO 45001, 14001 and 50001),
and subject to annual certification by an independent, third-party body.

In addition, in order to translate the environmental protection commitment into concrete actions, the
roles of Energy Manager and Mobility Manager were established, responsible for ensuring constant
oversight in areas within their remit.

A dedicated structure — Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) — has the task of overseeing the areas
that fall under the Group’s social and environmental responsibility, including the more specific issue of
climate change.

The Safety and Protection Head Office Department, which reports directly to the Managing Director
and CEO, is responsible for the coordination and maintenance of the Integrated Management System
adopted by the Group, along with activities connected with Energy Management.

In addition, pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 152/2006 and as amended, in 2019, the Head of the
Safety and Protection Head Office Department was also appointed Environmental Officer and given
broad decision-making, organisational and spending powers, including the preliminary approval of any
change in the production process that may be relevant for environmental purposes.

Moreover, the Group closely manages the risks connected with climate change by promoting adaptive
behaviour or conduct designed to mitigate this phenomenon, while simultaneously developing a culture
focused on prevention. For a detailed analysis, reference is made to the section Management of potential
risks and impacts related to climate change (see page 46).

CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION PLAN

In accordance with the environmental responsibility commitments undertaken by the Group, since 2009 Intesa
Sanpaolo has set mind to long-term goals through the creation of specific action plans. The first Intesa Sanpaolo
Environmental Plan covered the 2009-2013 period, and was followed by the plan relating to 2013-2016. Both Plans
set measurable goals in the areas of energy savings, economic savings and the reduction of CO, emissions. The
scope of the plans, limited to Italy in the first Plan, has gradually increased with the inclusion of various International
Subsidiary Banks.
In 2017, CSR, in association with the Real Estate and Logistics, Procurement and Safety and Protection Head
Office Departments, the International Subsidiary Banks Division and the Chief Operating Officer and Chief IT, Digital
and Innovation Officer Governance Areas, drafted a new Environmental Plan - the Climate Change Action Plan
- with targets for 2022 and 2037. This Plan was reviewed by the Risks Committee and approved by the CEO. In
the Plan, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group outlines its goals as regards reducing the CO, emissions associated with its
activities, taking 2012 as its base year, including for the emission factors, in order to historicise the results achieved.
CSR will monitor the achievement of the targets on an annual basis and the results will be analysed with the relevant
competent structures. The monitoring of the Environmental Plan highlighted for 2019 a trend in line with the CO,
emission reduction forecasts.
The goals for 2022 include a reduction of 37% in absolute emissions connected with energy consumption (direct
and indirect) compared with 2012 (a 33% reduction was already recorded in the period 2012-2019).
The Plan also includes objectives related to consumption and energy production from renewable sources. In
particular:
* an increase in the use of renewable energy sources, from 76% at the end of 2012 to 81% by the end of 2022;
* the maintenance of electricity production levels from photovoltaic energy (over 1,000 MWh in 2016), taking
account of the restrictions and characteristics of the real estate assets.
Finally, in accordance with the international climate change agreements, long-term targets for 2037 have been set
which will be monitored and possibly reviewed at 5-year intervals.
