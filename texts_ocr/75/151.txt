SUMMARY OF ISSUES EMERGING FROM THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS

For each of the stakeholder groups involved in the engagement activities, the main findings that have emerged
also with respect to the issues investigated are set out below.

Employees: the company's solidity is also confirmed in 2019, it being one of the central aspects for employees
who show Satisfaction and awareness of the reliability of their employment situation. As regards the enhance-
ment and development aspects, there are strong views regarding growth opportunities and professional skills
enhancement. Greater emphasis is also being placed on the aspects related to the integration of employees,
linked to the recent acquisition and reassignment initiatives and in line with the bank's increasingly clear com-
mitment in the areas of inclusion and non-discrimination.

The implementation of the initiatives envisaged in the Business Plan has led to the confirmation and growth of
some positive trends already recorded. Among these, the strengthening of smart working and the attention to
work-life balance play an important role. The employees who were consulted recognise the validity of Intesa
Sanpaolo's welfare policies, identifying as an additional improvement objective its increasingly effective disse-
mination in all corporate organisations, including through the involvement of middle managers. In the context
of customer relations, the employees’ attention shifts towards digitisation and paperless initiatives, also thanks
to the commitments set out to this effect in the Business Plan.

On the basis of what emerged from the meeting with the Trade Unions, Intesa Sanpaolo's choice to carry out
a half-yearly non-financial reporting is welcomed by the employees, who consider it an additional and signifi-
cant element for monitoring the objectives pertaining to sustainability. The disclosure of information on Intesa
Sanpaolo's commitments and on the results achieved in terms of sustainability thus encourages a more wide-
spread shared corporate culture on these aspects.

Customers: listening to customers has shown that the aspects relating to the company's value and solidity
remain of great importance, in particular corporate customers confirm a high attention to the Group's capita-
lisation. The integrity in corporate conduct continues to be fundamental for retail customers. Considering the
aspects of economic, social and environmental sustainability that do not directly concern customer relations,
the aspects related to the environment emerge above all others from the listening activities in 2019. This em-
phasis is probably influenced also by the international media context and, for businesses, by the publication of
guidelines, especially in the context of the European Action Plan to finance sustainable growth. For customers,
the attention to environmental aspects translates especially into the contribution that the Bank can make to the
transition to a green and circular economy and to the fight against climate change. In particular, there was an
increase in interest in the issue of green bonds. The trend to shift attention from the Bank's direct environmen-
tal impacts to indirect ones is now established. In the area of social issues, a high interest in supporting non-
profit organisations and in the social and cultural development of the community is maintained. The attention
