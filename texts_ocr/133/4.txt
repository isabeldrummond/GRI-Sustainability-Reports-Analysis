How do we realize it? Through men and women that are part of our Team, who believe in these values and
make them a source of attraction, inspiration and action for our clients.

This is what we do: advisory services to plan, develop and monitor internal control and governance systems
and Sustainability Reporting and Integrated Reporting processes.

This has been our vision since the foundation of the Company. In 2017 we tried to decline our philosophy
considering the wider context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) promoted by the United Nations.

On September 25", 2015, the United Nations approved the Global Agenda for sustainable development,
together with 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) declined in 169 Target, planned to be achieved
within 2030.

The current development model is considered to be unsustainable in all its dimensions (environmental,
economic and social dimension). The real disruptive aspect of the Agenda consists in going over the idea that
sustainability is exclusively linked with the environment. Most of all, it endorses an integrated vision of the
different dimensions of development.

Each Country (with no distinction between developed, developing and emerging country) is asked to
promote a more sustainable way of living. Additionally, each country is committed to designing its own
sustainable development strategy to reach SDGs’ Targets.

The fulfilment of the Agenda requires a strong involvement of the entire society: from organizations until the
public sector, from citizens until philanthropic institutions, from universities and research centres until
cultural and educational operators.

Aware of the contribute that each organization can offer in fulfilling the Global Agenda, we compared our
vision of sustainability with SDGs objectives, and we identified three aspects in which the impact of our
operations is undeniable:

established time limit.
