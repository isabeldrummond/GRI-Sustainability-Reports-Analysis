The applied National Collective Agreement pertains to the Service Sector and, given the young age of the
Team, we do not have different contractual frameworks given the lack of managers and executives in our
current organogram.

In 2017, besides the ordinary retribution, Euros 7 thousand were distributed concerning 2016 targets
(approximately 4% of 2016’s revenues) and our 2017’s target amounted to Euros 4 thousand (approximately
2% of 2017’s revenues) which will be distributed in 2018. The difference in terms of amount and effects on
revenues, between the two fiscal years, depends on 2017 turnover and on revenue increase from 2016 to
2017.

The variable compensation scheme (which is linked to individual and business results) that is currently in
place, is divided in the following pillars:

- Production premium: is equal to a % of a target turnover;

- Market performance premium: measured on the contribute that every member of the Team realises
for the acquisition of new clients and or consulting agreements;

- Personal performance premium: is equal to a variable amount and linked to the achievement of
different objectives that have been assigned in the previous year.

This scheme, which has been set up since the beginning of the Company, is going to be modified in 2019 due
to the introduction of a welfare system aimed at rewarding employees with plans that better meet their
attitudes and needs, without restricting premiums to a mere economic amount. We are convinced that the
personal growth of each Team’s member also requires time to take care of themselves (in the widest sense)
considering their individual attitudes.

Today VIVIDA is managed by a sole Director; we aim to change the governance structure within 2020,
creating a Board of Directors that better represents gender equality among its members.

Occupational health and safety are fundamental subjects for the proper management of a company. From
some years, this concept has become wider and now it includes psychophysical well-being, whose indicators
are: low absenteeism and low injury-rate, few overtime hours, low turnover-rate and long permanency in
the Company.

Being a consulting firm, the risk of occupational injuries is low. Additionally, we carry out regular monitoring
activities of our working conditions, complying with normative standards and applied laws (Italy Legislative
Decree April 9°", 2008 n. 81 “Testo Unico di salute e sicurezza sul lavoro”). In support of this, VIVIDA is not
exposed to the risk of occupational disease and there was no event of work-related injury accident in 2017.

Absentee rate? is 4,1%, which corresponds to 9 lost days because of illnesses. Days of parental leave have
been 32. There is any lost day because of strike or permit for Trade Unions duties. Overtime hours up to 31*
December 2017 are 14, less than 1% of total worked hours.

c) VIVIDA’S economic performance

For us “value” means the ability to transform our advisory services in a real support for clients. The Direct
Economic Value Generated and Distributed (EVG&D) shows VIVIDA’s ability to create wealth and distribute it
to its stakeholders, representing a concrete conjunction between economic/financial data and non-financial
information. Therefore, one of our main objectives is to spread, through our advisory activity, the culture of
