inherent to those of our Team. Comparing these two years, 2016’s commissions required a more
frequent support (in terms of skills) of external experts.

- Employees: their value approximatively represents a quarter of VIVIDA’s EVG&D. We know it is not
enough. We are growing in terms of professionality and complexity and our objective is to achieve
the 50% of the average value produced. Obviously, this ambitious objective, that becomes reality
through economic recognition and employee’s welfare plans, will be possible in the medium term,
after the achievement of expected revenues results.

- Partners: our policy is to store dividends. Our achieved net result represents a value that we will
invest in the growth of VIVIDA and its people. Today, after nearly 4 years of business, we started
thinking about the development of VIVIDA in the next future. In the following years, these thoughts
and reflections will be translated in a development project, not only from a dimensional point of
view, but also from a cultural one.

- Depreciation and amortization: it represents the dimension of investments started in April 2016,
when we moved to our new office in Via Verdi 23. Now, spaces are big enough to host a Team of
8/10 professionals and, first, we wanted them to stay in a comfortable and pleasant space, rather
than a place where employees just work, considering that we spent there most of our time.

5. VIVIDA’S ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT
a) Transport

For us, living and working responsibly means being sustainable also from the environmental point of view.
We believe that this is a “sine qua non” condition of doing business, especially nowadays that, more than
ever, there is this widespread awareness that every company can actively contribute to the global transition
owards economies that take care of the environment, are energy-efficient and are interested in individuals’
well-being.

n pursuing this objective, we are inspired by the Precautionary Principle*, as promoted by the United
Nations. From our vision, this Principle means finding solutions as soon as we understand the potential
negative impact of our activity. This Principle helps us in mitigating and solving our impacts, where possible.
t is an approach that we use also with our clients and employees.

With this first sustainability report, we started to monitor our environmental footprint and outline our
approach towards the environment. The reported results represent our point of departure, that will help us
0 progressively improve and find our most "sustainable path”, allowing us to reduce our environmental

 

impact.
