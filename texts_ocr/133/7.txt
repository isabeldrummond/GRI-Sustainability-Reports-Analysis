and dynamic Team, always available to cooperate and help each other in every situation. For this reason, we
completely rely on them.

Clients

Over the years, our networks allowed us to expand VIVIDA’s presence in strategic areas of our Country.
VIVIDA’s network is composed by both small and big enterprises that require constant support and
assistance. Our projects are complex, and they need a constant presence.

Professionals

Given the complexity of the business contest, we are aware that meeting clients’ needs just by ourselves is
increasingly more difficult. For this reason, we have developed strong professional relationships to ensure an
appropriate and complete service in challenging engagements too when our competences are not enough.
Mutual trust and shared willingness to offer added value are at the heart of every VIVIDA’s partnership.

Suppliers

Also, in the supplier’s selection process, VIVIDA considers that the careful and the respect towards the
environment and our society are fundamental parameters. For this reason, when possible, we select
suppliers that come from close areas, that care about the quality of the products and that minimize their
environmental and social impact.

The community

We often work far from our Headquarters, but we are an entrepreneurial reality that cares and lives in its
local community. The community is a fundamental stakeholder for VIVIDA and, when possible, we are proud
of helping institutions, schools and universities, associations.

Banks

VIVIDA’s set up was supported by Banca Etica, with which we share values and projects. Thanks to our
common vision, we have built a strong and lasting relation, that is going to create mutual value.

This first sustainability report has allowed us to reflect on different stakeholder categories that are
influenced by VIVIDA’s actions. We did not activate a real stakeholder engagement process during 2017, but
we are going to study the best approach for 2018, considering the dimensions and the complexity of the
organization.

d) Materiality and Disclosure Management Approach

Because of what previously communicated, the Materiality Analysis has been done “internally” and it has
allowed us to identify the relevant aspects that represent our current organization.

The Materiality Principle says that a sustainability report should include only relevant aspects (that means
aspects which reflect significant impacts concerning economic, environmental and social fields) which
influence stakeholders’ decisions. This selection can be done through the materiality analysis, which allows
to identify material aspects to include in the report.

Being our first sustainability report, we chose for an internal “desk” analysis that includes all the information
that we considered to be relevant for our stakeholders. The criterion that we have used for selecting the
information was the Disclosure Management Approach, which is based on the following factors:
