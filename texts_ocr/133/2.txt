1. OUR FIRST SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

Many times, | have heard people saying, “We are not as big and organized to start a sustainability project” or
“Why should we do it?”. It is difficult to find a convincing answer to these objections, especially when
managers’ horizon is limited and they are unable to understand the opportunities that a transparent report
can offer. | am referring to strategical opportunities or chances to increase the overall portion of shared
value.

For this reason, few years after our foundation, we thought it was the moment to start our sustainability
journey, convinced that it is going to help us in setting our medium and long-term goals, with more
awareness and focus.

VIVIDA’s sustainability report represents, in my opinion, an experience from which everyone can learn
something, in fact, everyone can write his or her own sustainability report given that we all use resources
and give back the effects from their usage.

Knowing how your own company operates is fundamental: this awareness allows you to understand the
impacts, both positive and negative, that it may have towards the society and the environment. Nowadays,
being “transparent” and explaining how an organization produces social benefits (internal and external) is an
increasingly more urgent and current issue. The sustainability report is a tool for setting medium and long-
term actions, it facilitates the contact with the external reality and gives to the organization a better
perception of the impacts of its activities.

Thanks to the sustainability report, we can finally start our journey, with the aim of setting challenging goals,
but always considering our dimension and complexity, with the certainty that this exercise will enrich our
experience during the time.

For us, the willingness of being “responsible” is not only a “manifesto” or a good intention, but it is a
coherent conduct embedded in the whole Team.
