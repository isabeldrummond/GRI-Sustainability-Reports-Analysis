2. FROM THE LATIN “VIVIDUS”
a) The Team

The Latin attribute “VIVIDUS” refers to a vigorous, determined and firm behaviour. These adjectives are the
driving engine of the Team.

VIVIDA & Partners was set up in 2014 and is the result of the initiative of professional experiences from
different contexts, especially Big Four.

Carlo, Andrea, Mara, Chiara & Chiara are the soul of the Team.

b) Partners and associations

Not only the people who have invested in the share capital of the company, but our partners are also our
clients, the professionals with which we share complex projects, our suppliers and our bank.

We have built strong and lasting relations with all of them since we believe that we can create value for the
whole society only through the mutual exchange of knowledge.

VIVIDA’s professionals participate in the following organizations:

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Gold Community: VIVIDA, through its
FE membership in the GOLD Community, actively supports GRI’s mission in
\ developing guidelines for sustainability reports based on transparency, with the

GRI
Nese aim of widening their adoption from worldwide organizations.

in 1972 and recognised as Italian affiliate of |.|.A — Institute of Internal Auditors. It

1A is the world’s leading entity for standards, certifications and training concerning

Associazione Italiana . .
Internal Auditors the Internal Auditor profession.

c) Governance

VIVIDA’s governance is extremely simple. Now there are only two shareholders (but our goal is to increase
them): Carlo Vasile, the founder, has most of the shares and is the sole director.

VIVIDA does not have a Statutory Board of Auditors, nor has it a legal auditor since it does not satisfy, at this
time, quantitative thresholds set by the Italian Regulator.

The corporate governance is managed by the sole director, who collaborates with external providers to
comply with accounting, tax, labour and corporate duties.

3. VIVIDA, NOT ONLY GREEN
a) Our vision

We strongly believe that behaviours based on respect and attention for people, society and the environment
are the foundations to create shared value in all its dimensions. This is our “why?”
