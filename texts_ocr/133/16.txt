‘an Fair-trade products: the products that we buy ensure the protection of the territory and its
community.

Among these products, we list coffee pods, chocolate and other snacks and beverages.

In 2017, the total spending on local suppliers accounted for 31% of the overall expense. Our supplier
selection process is still not supported by a formalized system of environmental/social assessment. As future
objective, we commit ourselves to implementing and creating a supplier database, that will support our
selection process, following specific guidelines.

In our activity, the elements that impact the most are paper, toners and water plastic bottles.

In 2017, we used only 2 reams of paper (equivalent to 1.000 sheets of paper), while for what concerns toner,
starting from the purchase of the printer in May 2016, only the black one (1 toner) was refilled at the end of
the year. This demonstrates that we do not like to print, except when it is strictly necessary. Nowadays
technology, cloud and electronic archive are tools that we use for reaching this important objective.

We still need to improve in the reduction of plastic waste, due to the daily use of plastic bottles. Aware of
the damages caused by the huge quantity of plastic scattered around the environment, and after having
monitored our 2017 plastic footprint, we are considering different alternatives and solutions to adopt in
2018. The objective of our reflection is finding out an alternative to plastic bottles that is less environmental
affecting and, at the same time, adequate to our reality.

Our 2017 consumption of plastic, that amounts to 438 water bottles, is represented as follow:

N° WATER PLASTIC BOTTLES eS TOTAL EUROS

In general, VIVIDA’s objective is the reduction of waste and its proper disposal, following a recycling vision. In
any case, our activity entails neither production waste nor waste with relevant impacts on the environment.

In 2017, VIVIDA was not subject to any monetary or non-monetary sanction regarding non-compliance
behaviours with environmental laws and regulations.

6. A DAILY COMMITMENT
a) VIVIDA’s social engagement

Sustainability, in its wider meaning (economic, environmental and social), is an essential part of our
corporate strategy. During 2017, VIVIDA set objectives regarding social sustainability that has realized
through two different modalities:

- Donations: we foster the development of Piacenza community supporting local no-

profit associations, among which Club Alpino Italiano (CAI). For example, VIVIDA

contributed to the organization and the co-financing of a cultural event in June 2018 at

CAI’s site.

- Collaboration with universities: thanks to the strong relationship with Universita

Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, we actively collaborate to the growth of university students
and to their job placement through the realization of workshops and internships. For instance, a
