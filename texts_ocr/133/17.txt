student started an internship in September 2017 (and then hired in March 2018) and another
started a curricular internship in February 2018.

In VIVIDA’s vision, the support to initiatives/people/Institutions should not become either an economic
dependency or a tie, rather it should be a stimulus. We are convinced that whatever mean of contribution,
economic or effective, should be addressed to create additional value and, therefore, support growth. Only
when these conditions are in place, we are ready to get in the game.

b) 2018-2019 objectives

Figured out what emerged in 2017 and verified our alignment towards the 3 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) before mentioned, we list in the following chart our main objectives in the short run:

Even though VIVIDA is a small company, we aim at defining the guidelines
that characterise our conduct - 2018.

We will find an efficient alternative to water plastic bottles to reduce the
quantity of PET — 2018.
PET REDUCTION

We commit ourselves to adopting solutions for a greener mobility for
commuting (from home to work and to clients’ offices) to reduce CO2

iS CARS REDUCTION emissions — 2018.

We will try to introduce a monitoring system for waste production inside

the office — 2018/2019.

We aim at creating a welfare plan for all employees, because we would
like to offer them additional tools for nourishing their attitudes and
ambitions, for satisfying their desires or necessities — 2019.

Initiative (GRI) guidelines.

In 2016, GRI published updated “Sustainability Reporting Standard” which replaced G4’s guidelines. These
standards can be applied following three different approaches: core, comprehensive or GRI — referenced.

Considering the complexity of our company, its dimensions and our possibility to collect the information, we
decided to adopt the “core” approach, defined by GRI as follow:

“The Core option contains the essential elements of a sustainability report. The Core option provides the
background against which an organization communicates the impacts of its economic, environmental and social
and governance performance’.

New standards guidelines have been re-organised in a modular structure with Universal Standards and Topic-
Specific Standards, linked one another. The three Universal Standards introduce the reporting principles and
