explain how to create a sustainability report (GRI 101 — Foundation); they provide information regarding the
organization and its reporting practices (GRI 102 — General Disclosure) and explain why the topic is material
with its impacts (GRI 103 - Management Approach).

The application of the Materiality Principle, stated by GRI 101, allows to identify the topics with the most
important impacts and which are relevant for stakeholders, therefore it helps in the selection of material
Topic-Specific Standards for the organization. They cover economic impacts (200 Series — Economic Topics),
environmental impacts (300 Series — Environmental Topics) and social impacts (400 Series — Social Topics).
The feature of “Materiality” must be applied to the content and to the quality of information included in the
report.

More precisely, to define the content of our sustainability report, we considered the following principles:

- Stakeholder inclusiveness: the reporting organization shall identify its stakeholders and explain how it
has responded to their reasonable expectations and interests.

- Sustainability context: the report shall present the reporting organization’s performance in the wider
context of sustainability.

-  Materiality: the report shall cover topics that reflect the reporting organization's significant
economic, environmental, and social impacts; or substantively influence the assessments and
decisions of stakeholders.

- Completeness: the report shall include coverage of material topics and their Boundaries, sufficient to
reflect significant economic, environmental, and social impacts, and to enable stakeholders to assess
the reporting organization’s performance in the reporting period.

To define the quality of the reported information, we considered the following principles:

- Accuracy: the reported information shall be sufficiently accurate and detailed for stakeholders to
assess the reporting organization’s performance.

- Balance: the reported information shall reflect positive and negative aspects of the reporting
organization’s performance to enable a reasoned assessment of overall performance.

- Clarity: the reporting organization shall make information available in a manner that is
understandable and accessible to stakeholders using that information.

- Comparability: the reporting organization shall select, compile, and report information consistently.
The reported information shall be presented in a manner that enables stakeholders to analyse
changes in the organization’s performance over time, and that could support analysis relative to
other organizations.

- Reliability: the reporting organization shall gather, record, compile, analyze, and report information
and processes used in the preparation of the report in a way that they can be subject to
examination, and that establishes the quality and materiality of the information.

- Timeliness: the reporting organization shall report on a regular schedule so that information is
available in time for stakeholders to make informed decisions.

Exceptions

Being our first sustainability report, there are neither “restatement” of information provided in the previous
years, nor variations concerning relevant aspects to report.

The frequency of reporting and updating of the document is annual. 2017 sustainability report is not submitted
to external independent assurance.
