b) Energy consumption

Our energy consumption is limited to the use of working places. We only use electricity for turning on lights
and electronic devices while, only in winter, natural gas for heating the offices. To ease comparisons
between the different resources, we transformed the quantitative data in metric tons of CO2 equivalent.

O For what concerns electricity, in 2017 we have consumed 1.037 kWh, which correspond to 0,72
metric tons of CO2 equivalent.

For what concerns natural gas, in 2017 we have consumed 1.344 smc, which correspond to 2,8
metric tons of CO2 equivalent.

In conclusion, our emissions are both direct and indirect: the first ones (Scope 1) are related to fuel
consumption (natural gas, LPG, oil) therefore they include heating and commuting (driving from home to
work or to clients’ offices); the second ones (Scope 2) are related to electricity consumption. Therefore, we
can resume the overall quantity of CO2 emissions as follow:

 

 

GHG EMISSIONS olen g 2017 TONS OF CO2
Indirect GHG Emissions — Scope 1

e = Natural gas 1.344 smc 2,80

e Transportation 104.925 km 9,50
Direct GHG Emissions — Scope 2

e — Electricity 1.937 kWh 0,72
TOTAL 13,02

 

 

 

c) Water, paper and...

We care about the quantity and the quality of consumable materials that we use in our daily activities. When
possible, we select suppliers who respect environmental and social parameters.

Here we explain the requirements that we take into consideration and that influence our decisions in the
supplier selection process:

® Geographic location: areas close to the place where we work.

The furniture in our office is realized, in part, by local artisans that, thanks to the high quality of their
manufacture, gave to the spaces a peculiar aspect. When possible, we try to prefer geographic proximity also
for the selection of services (for example, computer assistance, electricians and carpenters) with the aim of
reducing GHG emissions, a natural consequence of trucking.

@d

Concerning the selection of stationery, dishes, toilet paper and kitchen towels, we verify that they are
produced with reused or recyclable materials.

Ecological and sustainable materials: pvc-free, recyclable or created with reused materials.
