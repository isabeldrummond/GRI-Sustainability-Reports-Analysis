Each VIVIDA’s employee is qualified by a bachelor’s or master’s degree, from the economic or humanistic
field; in addition to this, some employees are further qualified by major in Corporate Social Responsibility
Management or Internal Audit.

b) Quality is the biggest award

We believe that human capital is our biggest resource because VIVIDA’s value and quality become reality
exclusively through our professionals.

To facilitate employees’ work-life balance, we have introduced Smart-working practices. Thanks to IT
technology, they enable employees to work outside the office wall, without any time or space restriction.
Each employee, whose activity can be performed remotely, can benefit from Smart-working practices, with
no negative effects on the productivity, on expected results or on colleagues’ work. During 2017, 3 resources
benefited from this practice.

The average Gross Annual Salary for category and gender has been calculated for employees of both genders
and refined from the misrepresented effect of part-time contracts. No differences in the amount of women’s
and men’s salaries that have the same professional experience and contract (part-time vs full-time) have
been reported.
