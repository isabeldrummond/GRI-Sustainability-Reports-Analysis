FCA Adoption is the adoption by the Company of high schools located
near FCA plants. Adopted schools participate in a comprehensive
work-school program. Students have the opportunity to learn from
FCA managers about the various professional paths available in a
global company. They can participate in typical work situations such as
meetings, brainstorming, on-site audits and systems analysis. In 2018,
1,400 students from 15 high schools were enrolled in this program.

FCAe_discovery is an online product for students, with tutors
available to assist when needed. The content teaches students
about all aspects of a company from the inside out, with a special
focus on the automotive industry. Because this project is provided
online, any school in Italy has the opportunity to participate, even
if they are not located near an FCA facility. In 2018, approximately
7,300 students took part.

Winning Futures

FCA is helping challenged high school students in the U.S. through
the Workforce Prep program offered by Winning Futures. Workforce
Prep is an in-school mentoring and leadership skills development
program that addresses the critical need to better prepare students
for life and careers after high school. Through a €43,600 grant from
the FCA Foundation in 2018 and the support of FCA employee
volunteers, students gained critical workplace skills and hands-
on experience, empowering them with the tools, knowledge and
motivation they will need to realize a meaningful career and upward
mobility.

School LEAP Program

Fiat India Automobiles Private Limited (FIAPL) supports the School
LEAP program which aims to improve access to quality education for
students through digital literacy and effective teaching and learning
tools. The program also strives to enhance the learning environment
and improve educational outcomes. The School LEAP program was
launched in six government schools in Shirur (India) for class 1 to
7 standard. The initiative will focus on overall school development,
with the involvement of students, teachers, the school Management
Committee, parents and the local community.

MeccaniCotto

FCA’s parts and service brand, Mopar, leads the MeccaniCotto project
in collaboration with the Cottolengo school in Turin (Italy). Cottolengo,
which has a two-century history of helping the disadvantaged,
focused their 2018 efforts on bringing autistic students into the
program. This initiative is aimed at helping young students enter the
working environment, providing them with the necessary skills to
work in vehicle maintenance. Mopar supplied the school with working
labs, tools and equipment, and provided training on quick service
processes and standards to Cottolengo’s trainers.

Michigan Council of Women in Technology

FCA is engaged in a number of initiatives to promote studies and
careers in technical fields among segments of the population that
may be under-represented in science, technology, engineering and
math (STEM) vocations. We partner, for example, with the Michigan
Council of Women in Technology (MCWT) Foundation on programs
such as “GET-IT” (Girls Exploring Together Information Technology).
This after-school team activity runs throughout the school year
and is designed to encourage high school girls to consider and
ultimately pursue a STEM-related career. In 2018, FCA hosted 75
young women from Detroit-area schools for a “GET-IT” event at our
facility in Auburn Hills (U.S.). The day offered an opportunity for the
students to meet with FCA employees and explore technologies
such as augmented reality with the professionals responsible for
implementing them. The program also helps prepare students
for college, strengthening their teamwork, problem-solving and
organization abilities. Throughout 2018, FCA employees volunteered
nearly 400 hours to a variety of programs offered with MCWT.

Masters in Manufacturing 4.0

To train graduates for a role within the manufacturing industry, FCA’s
production systems company, Comau, collaborated with Politecnico
of Turin (Italy) to create a Masters in Manufacturing 4.0 program.
Funded by the Region of Piedmont, this two-year postgraduate
program is designed to attract the best graduates in engineering
from Italian and foreign universities, and provide them specialized
training in industrial automation. The curriculum also includes
a focus on environmental sustainability and vehicle emissions
reduction. Courses are taught in part by Comau managers and
are conducted entirely in English, with 660 hours of project work
at Comau in the second year. Many engineers were hired into the
Comau apprenticeship program from the seven graduating classes,
a clear indication of the success of the program.

Rota do Saber

FCA launched the Rota do Saber program in 2015, near the
Company's plant in Goiana (Brazil). This program trains elementary
school teachers and school administrators to improve public
education. In the city of Igarassu, where the program has been in
place for three years, the Basic Education Development Index in
elementary school grew 46%, from 2.8 to 4.1, exceeding the target
of 3.8 defined by the Brazilian Government. In 2018, the Rota do
Saber initiative was expanded to the city of Betim, reaching an
additional 30,000 students, 1,000 teachers and about 69 schools.
