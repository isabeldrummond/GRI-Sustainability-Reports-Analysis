FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION
AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

FCA respects workforce members’ freedom of association,
and publicly affirms this commitment in the FCA Human Rights
Guidelines. These Guidelines state that business partners and
suppliers with whom the Group does business are also expected
to adhere to our standards, including, but not limited to, human
rights. Moreover, the Sustainability Guidelines for Suppliers
describe expectations for Group suppliers and sub-tier suppliers
worldwide.

Workforce members are free to choose to join a trade union
in accordance with local law and the rules of the various
trade union organizations. FCA recognizes and respects
the right of our employees to be represented by trade unions
or other representatives established in accordance with the
locally applicable legislation and practice. When engaging in
negotiations with representatives, FCA’s actions and behavior
seek a constructive approach and relationship. As confirmation of
the importance the Group places on social dialogue, trade union
representatives from Group companies were invited to participate
in the all-day event when FCA presented the 2018-2022 business
plan in June 2018.

At December 31, 2018, 88.8% of employees worldwide, including
Sevel (Italy), were covered by collective bargaining agreements
at any level, based on an average figure that covers a variety
of situations in accordance with regulations and practices in
the various countries. In nonunionized companies, 97.7% of
employees not covered by collective bargaining benefit from
conditions that are supplemental to, or better than, the minimum
required by law.

In 2018, a survey covering approximately 89% of the total
workforce worldwide, including Sevel (Italy), showed that
83.5% of employees were covered by representative bodies.
Representative bodies, generally elected by local plant workers,
are entitled to be informed and consulted, and negotiate on
specific issues as provided by law or applicable collective
agreements.

In the European Union countries, employee representative
bodies are established for companies or sites where employee
numbers exceed the minimum limits specified by national laws
or procedures. In the NAFTA region, representatives are present
at sites where a trade union has been established. In China, FCA
employees are free to form a representative council in accordance
with national labor laws, local rules and regulations.

In most countries, dialogue occurs through industrial and
employers’ associations to which the Group companies belong.

In 2018, an analysis was carried out in those countries that have
not ratified fundamental International Labour Organization (ILO)
Conventions on freedom of association or the right to organize
and collectively bargain. It covered over 98% of employees at
Group companies in Brazil, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, China,
India and Malaysia, and showed that the application of these
rights and principles is ensured through local legislation.

Relevant examples of collective bargaining agreements in
countries where FCA has a significant presence are summarized
