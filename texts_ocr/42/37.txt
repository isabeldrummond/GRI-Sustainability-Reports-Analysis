Risk management is an important business driver and is
integral to the achievement of the Group’s long-term business
plan. We take an integrated approach to risk management,
where risk and opportunity assessment are at the core of the
leadership team agenda.

Our success as an organization depends on our ability to
identify and capitalize on the opportunities generated by our
business and the markets in which we compete. By managing
the associated risks, we strive to achieve a balance between
our goals of growth and return and the related risks.
