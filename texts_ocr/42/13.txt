ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS

Gathering stakeholder input to determine materiality is an ongoing
process. As a global enterprise with a complex, intricately connected
value chain, FCA engages with a wide range of stakeholders,
including employees, customers, suppliers, dealers, institutions,
investors, trade unions, associations and local communities.
Because they either affect or are affected by our decision-making
processes and associated actions, they help us to better identify
risks and opportunities, as well as align our objectives to social,
technological and regulatory changes around the globe.

Our FCA sustainability-focused Stakeholder Engagement Guidelines
form the basis for this continuous dialogue. They help define the
goals of the dialogue, set the criteria for identifying and prioritizing
stakeholders, and provide a general framework for sustainability-
related stakeholder engagement activities.

We annually conduct surveys and stakeholder engagement activities
related to sustainability topics, and work to expand and innovate our
dialogue with stakeholders in the belief that these activities are an
essential part of a robust sustainability program.

In each of the regions where FCA operates, our stakeholder initiatives
are adapted to locally relevant topics.

The regional results from our stakeholder engagement survey and
events are analyzed to address differences and guide, globally, the
review of potential updates in FCA’s material sustainability topics.

In 2018, more than 5,000 internal and external stakeholders
worldwide completed our revised online survey regarding
sustainability topics. We also gathered qualitative data and captured
some key topics and concerns through a free text field in the survey,
intended to explore new or emerging material topics.

Our “live,” or face-to-face, stakeholder events each year reflect our
efforts to reach a broad spectrum of key stakeholders of all ages.
We work with representatives across FCA to identify which groups
or individuals can most effectively help us explore the relevant and
material topics we identified for 2018. Below are some examples of
our 2018 engagement activities.

Engaging Employees

FCA employees play a particularly vital role in our sustainability efforts
and are the focus of several stakeholder engagement activities each
year. Our interaction with employees serves a two-fold purpose: to
communicate to them the importance of the work they do every day
to strengthen FCA's sustainability profile, and to learn potential areas
for improvement from them.

Engaging Hourly Plant Workers

To extend the reach of our sustainability messaging, we engaged
approximately 700 hourly workers at our Mirafiori plant in Italy
through a specially-designed sustainability training event. This
training consisted of six modules, each lasting four hours, on FCA’s
impact related to a wide variety of economic, environmental and
social topics. Employees gave the training high marks, when asked
to evaluate its effectiveness.

New Employee Orientation

In 2018, FCA conducted a number of activities among our newly-
hired employees to promote sustainability awareness and encourage
them to become sustainability advocates. A dedicated focus on
sustainability was included in new hire orientation sessions and
round table talks in various locations.

Sustainability Boulevard - Innovative Training Program

FCA’s innovative learning program, the Sustainability Boulevard,
was extended into 2018. This virtual platform engaged employees
worldwide by testing their sustainability knowledge and offering
ways they can contribute to the Company's sustainability profile.
The Sustainability Boulevard represents one area, or “district,” of our
game-based learning project around which new training programs
are being developed. Nearly 40,000 employees had the opportunity
to participate, with approximately 1,900 actively engaged with the
learning game within the platform. In 2018, this initiative received the
HR Excellence & Innovation Award. The Award is open to companies
operating in Italy with the purpose of disseminating best practices in
the workplace and human resource management.

Sustainability Business Challenge

Top performers from the Sustainability Boulevard training were
invited in 2018 to participate in a Sustainability Business Challenge
offered jointly by FCA’s Training Management and Sustainability
organizations. This initiative assigned participants from seven
countries a real business case related to enhancing FCA'’s
sustainability profile. Through teamwork, the selected employees
built connections across several regions and business functions;
learned more about FCA’s sustainability practices; and developed
concrete solutions to communicate FCA’s sustainability approach
inside and outside the Company, including ideas for employees to
contribute directly to FCA’s activities. The teams’ final proposals were
evaluated by a Steering Committee consisting of FCA executives,
providing an opportunity for participants to interact with senior
management.

Following completion of the Business Challenge, participants
were surveyed about their experience. Fully 100% of respondents
reported that their understanding of sustainability topics improved
during this initiative.
