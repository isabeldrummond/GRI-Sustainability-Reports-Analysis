> 01_MESSAGE TO STAKEHOLDERS_MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND THE CEO.

The other significant technological shift that we are likely to see in
the near future is related to electrification, which we also addressed
in our business plan. Our expectation is to continue reducing CO,
emissions through a combination of technologies aligned to the
vehicle mix, consumer needs and regulatory framework in each
market. By 2022, we intend to offer 12 electrified propulsion systems
on global architectures spanning the full range of vehicle segments
and over 30 vehicle nameplates with electrified solutions.

The objectives we have set for the future, together with the significant
steps already taken, are clear evidence of our business principles
and determination to ensure that the achievement of financial targets
goes hand-in-hand with respect for all stakeholders.

Among our sustainable initiatives in 2018, we implemented around
5,000 environmental projects at our plants around the world,
reducing our carbon footprint per vehicle produced by 27 percent
compared with 2010 and reducing waste generated per vehicle
produced by 62 percent compared with 2010.

Our corporate citizenship efforts are rooted in the FCA Code of
Conduct and are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals.

We strive to enrich the vitality of the communities where we live and
work by creating jobs, giving back through employee volunteering
and providing financial support through our charitable initiatives.

During 2018, Group employees around the world volunteered
thousands of hours in support of a wide range of social projects.

We also aim to offer our employees an inclusive work environment,
where everyone feels respected and valued, and we are proud to
have our efforts recognized by organizations such as the Thomson
Reuters D&l Index, which included FCA among the top 100 most
diverse and inclusive organizations in the world.

We decided to name our FCA Student Achievement Awards in
honor of Sergio Marchionne, which is a way to reaffirm his principles
and beliefs by supporting the most talented and deserving children
of our employees.

The results we achieved, in terms of both growth and value, were
possible because of what FCA is today.

We are a strong, competitive group that possesses some of the
most innovative technologies and one of the most extensive product
ranges and strongest brands in the world.

We are a flexible yet cohesive group, with a global footprint, and solid
enough to cope with any unexpected changes in market conditions.

We wish to thank all of our shareholders and stakeholders for your
support, whether you have been with us for many years or just a few
months. Your trust is fundamental for FCA as we embark on the next
phase of our development.
