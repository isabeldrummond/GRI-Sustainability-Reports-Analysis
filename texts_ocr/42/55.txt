e At the beginning of 2018, activities of Comau Poland Sp. z 0.0.
were terminated and the company was put in liquidation. This
decision was due to the repositioning of Comau to align with
current market demands for new products, technologies and
services, and the reorganization of the Comau European footprint
in line with emerging business opportunities. With a view to
limiting the related social impact, an agreement was reached with
all the trade union organizations.

In the NAFTA region, the Company has been realigning our
capacity to meet the demand for SUVs and trucks, utilizing the
existing plant infrastructure. To support the change, the Company
continues to utilize flexible operating patterns at NAFTA region
facilities and assess the number of manufacturing employees
needed to support our current and anticipated production
volumes. This assessment also includes additional engineering,
research and development and other highly skilled employees
to support product development, sales, marketing and other
corporate activities.

e In Argentina, the company utilized flexible operating patterns in

order to support the production of the new Fiat Cronos model.

Minimum Notice Period
for Operational Changes

Although regulations and practices from a local, regional and
national level can vary, FCA strives to keep employee representatives
involved when operational changes impact employees.

Within the European Union (EU), Directive 2001/23/EC stipulates
that when a transfer of an undertaking, business, or part of
an undertaking or business occurs as a result of a legal transfer
or merger, a disclosure and consultation process is required
with employee representatives. The procedure must be initiated
reasonably in advance of the transfer. FCA companies comply with
this Directive as implemented by the relevant laws and regulations of
each EU member state.

The agreement for the FCA European Works Council also specifies
conditions when employees are to be informed and consulted.

Outside the European Union, local laws and practices apply:

e U.S.: A federal law known as the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act (WARN Act), which applies to both
unionized and nonunionized employment sites, requires an
employer to give a minimum of 60 days’ advance notice of any
action that constitutes a plant closing or mass layoff. Several
states also regulate required notice periods for certain operational
changes.

Canada: Notice of termination regulations vary by province.
In Ontario, where the majority of the Canadian workforce is
employed, notification must be given at least eight weeks prior to
termination for employees with eight years or more of service. The
remaining FCA Canada LLC employees are located in Alberta and
Quebec, where the maximum notice requirement is eight weeks
for employees with more than ten years of service.

At unionized sites and/or plants in the U.S. and Canada, the level of
union involvement is normally defined by the collective bargaining
agreement signed between the company and the trade union and
is applicable at the plant level. The agreements usually specify the
information and consultation procedures to be followed in such
circumstances. At nonunionized plants, it is common practice
to make a company-wide announcement to all employees of
organizational changes relating to outsourcing, giving reasonable
prior notice of the operation.

e Mexico: Companies are required to notify the Federal Arbitration
and the Conciliation Board, as well as the trade unions, prior to
any large-scale employee layoffs or plant closures. In Mexico,
according to Federal Labor Law, prior to any large-scale employee
layoffs or plant closures, companies are required to inform the
Federal Labor Agency and the union. According to FCA’s Union
Bargaining Agreement, in case of any large-scale employee
layoff, the Company and the Union will agree to the terms and
conditions applicable to such layoff. However, no notification
period is expressly defined in Mexican labor law.

China: Labor Contract Law states that all operational changes
such as reorganizations, restructuring, or actions reducing
the workforce by 20 or more employees or less than 20 but
accounting for 10% of company employees must be notified to
the labor union or to the employees 30 days in advance. The
company must also provide the local labor authorities with a
workforce reduction plan.
