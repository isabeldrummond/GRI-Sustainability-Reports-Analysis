> 01_MESSAGE TO STAKEHOLDERS_MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND THE CEO.

The agreement to sell Magneti Marelli, a transaction which is expected
to close in the second quarter of 2019, will create one of the world’s
leading independent automotive component suppliers, recognizing
the full strategic value of our components business. Not only will
it provide a secure and exciting future for Magneti Marelli and its
employees but it will also allow us to further strengthen our balance
sheet and reward our shareholders with an extraordinary dividend.

Our consistently strong performance has resulted in ratings
upgrades from each of the three major credit rating agencies.

Adjusted EBIT for the year came in at a record €7.3 billion”,

Adjusted net profit climbed 34 percent to a record level of €5.0 billion”
and net profit was up 3 percent to €3.6 billion".

Worldwide combined shipments totaled 4.8 million units and net
revenues were up 4 percent to €115.4 billion.

Looking at our mass-market operations by region, NAFTA posted a
strong performance, attaining a record high in Adjusted EBIT, up 19
percent at €6.2 billion, with a margin of 8.6 percent. In the United
States, we reported the highest retail sales in 17 years, with both
Jeep and Ram brands hitting new records. We also completed
the most complex and intensive phase of the realignment of our
manufacturing footprint in the Region, in response to a continued
shift in demand towards trucks and SUVs.

LATAM posted robust growth with Adjusted EBIT more than doubling
from the previous year to €359 million and margin increasing by 250
basis points to 4.4 percent. In Brazil, we finished the year in a leading
position in three of the most important segments - pickups, light
commercial vehicles and SUVs - while in Argentina we improved our
market share despite the severe economic crisis in the second half
of the year.

Results in APAC were disappointing, Adjusted EBIT showed a loss
of €296 million, impacted by trade and regulatory challenges due to
market weakness and increased competition and reflecting lower
shipments from our Chinese joint venture.

In EMEA, performance was adversely affected by several factors,
including the transition to new emissions regulations. Lower volumes
and pricing actions in response to this transition, as well as higher
advertising costs to support the growth of Jeep brand, led to a
decrease in Adjusted EBIT to €406 million. Net revenues came in at
€22.8 billion, in line with prior year.

There was also a positive contribution from Maserati, although the
results were below the 2017 level, primarily due to market challenges
in China, as well as inventory management actions and lower
volumes in North America and Europe.

On the product side, we increased our offering with several key
vehicle launches.

Jeep launched: the all-new Grand Commander in China, a premium
seven-passenger SUV exclusive to the Chinese market; the all-new
Wrangler in Europe and Japan; the new Cherokee in Europe, China
and Japan; the new Renegade in LATAM. The all-new Gladiator, the
most capable mid-size pickup truck, made its worldwide debut at
the Los Angeles Auto Show.

Alfa Romeo revealed the new Stelvio and Giulia Quadrifoglio
Nurburgring limited editions, with 108 models of each produced to
commemorate the 108th anniversary of the brand.

At the New York International Auto Show, Maserati debuted the
Levante Trofeo V8 which will be sold in markets around the world.

Ram launched the all-new 1500, which has already won two of the
most prestigious awards in North America: 2018 North American
Truck of the Year (NACTOY) and Motor Trend Truck of the Year.

And we began 2019 with the reveal of the all-new Ram Heavy Duty
at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

As part of our commitment to stay at the forefront of the rapid
technological changes that are transforming our industry, we are
pursuing a multi-partner strategy for the development of advanced
driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies, working
with companies who are leaders in their respective sectors.

With Waymo, Google’s self-driving car project, we further
strengthened our partnership in 2018, announcing an agreement to
deliver up to an additional 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans
to support the launch of the first autonomous-car taxi service. We
also dedicated a new facility at our Chelsea Proving Grounds in the
United States for further development and testing of autonomous
vehicles and advanced safety technologies.

In addition, we are partnering with BMW for Level 3 autonomy and
APTIV for advanced driver assistance retail solutions, as these
initiatives provide the opportunity to fully leverage the capabilities of
each partner.

We believe that choosing the right technology at the right moment
is key to our ability to lead the way in the future of transportation,
especially now as emerging technologies are revolutionizing the
concept of personal mobility.

We are ready to tailor both the technologies and the platforms not
only to meet but also to shape that new vision.

Including Magneti Marelli, which is classified as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2018.
