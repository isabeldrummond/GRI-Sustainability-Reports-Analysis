FCA uses our best efforts to ensure that the Code is regarded as
a best practice of business conduct and observed by those third
parties with whom we maintain business relationships of a lasting
nature such as suppliers, dealers, advisors and agents. Group
contracts worldwide include specific clauses relating to recognition
and adherence to the principles underlying the Code of Conduct, as
well as compliance with local regulations, particularly those related to
corruption, money-laundering, terrorism and other crimes constituting
liability for legal persons.

The Code may be consulted and downloaded from FCA's website,
the employee portal and other employee communication channels
aimed at reaching the entire workforce. Copies can also be obtained
from Human Resources, the Legal Department or Internal Audit and
Compliance.

FCA disseminates the Code of Conduct and the values of good
governance to employees. The level of knowledge of the Code
of Conduct is measured via training with modules that test
comprehension. Completion rates are closely monitored.

During 2018, FCA offered training on conflict of interest, export
controls, anti-corruption, anti-trust, compliance with the Italian
legislative decree nÂ° 231/2001 (where applicable), corporate
governance and human rights, totaling roughly 138,000 individual
training sessions for FCA employees.

Acting with Integrity

The FCA Code of Conduct clearly and affirmatively requires
employees to report issues of non-compliance. Unless local law
provides otherwise, employees must report violations of law,
regulation or Company policy of which they become aware, including
but not limited to, issues involving vehicle safety, vehicle emissions,
financial reporting, or reports to governmental authorities. Any failure
in reporting such violations could place the Company at risk, and may
be the subject of disciplinary action.

FCA\s workforce and business partners can always effectively, and in
most countries anonymously if desired, communicate any concern,
including any vehicle safety, emissions or regulatory concern, or any
conflict of interest, through the Ethics Helpline.

The Ethics Helpline offers a worldwide, common and independent
intake channel via telephone (38 dedicated numbers in 22 languages)
and web to report any concerns of alleged situations, events, or actions
that may be inconsistent with the FCA Code of Conduct. It is managed
by an independent provider, available 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. FCA has chosen this reporting channel to meet compliance
needs and maintain a consistent reporting environment.

In addition, the FCA Ethics Helpline also allows employees,
suppliers, dealers, consumers and other stakeholders to request
advice about the application of the Code of Conduct (for example,
to verify definitions of terms or restrictions under the Code).

FCA employees may also seek advice concerning the application
and interpretation of the FCA Code of Conduct by contacting their
immediate supervisor, Human Resources representatives, or the
Legal Department.

Violations of the Code of Conduct are identified through:

reports received through the Ethics Helpline

e reports made to management or Human Resources

periodic activities carried out by Internal Audit and Compliance
e checks forming part of the standard operating procedures.

FCA analyzes and investigates the allegations received through the
Ethics Helpline; the results and any potential actions are assessed
by the Ethics and Compliance Committee at the regional level and,
where deemed necessary, escalated to the global FCA Ethics and
Compliance Committee. The relevant internal functions are notified
of the violations. The FCA Audit Committee is periodically updated
on the status of the allegations with a specific focus on significant
cases.
