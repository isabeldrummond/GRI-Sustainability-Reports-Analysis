BUSINESS MODEL AND VALUE CHAIN

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is a global automotive
group engaged in designing, engineering,
manufacturing, distributing and selling vehicles,
components and production systems worldwide
through 102 manufacturing facilities and 46 research
and development centers. The Group’s automotive
brands are: Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge,
Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia, Ram,
Maserati, the SRT performance vehicle designation
and Mopar, the parts and service brand.

In addition, FCA operates in the components and production
systems sectors under the Teksid and Comau brands. The Group
also provides retail and dealer finance, leasing and rental services
in support of the car business through subsidiaries, joint ventures
and commercial agreements with specialized financing services
providers.

FCA has operations in more than 40 countries, customers in more
than 135 countries, and business partnerships with suppliers and
dealers on a global scale. Due to the complexity of the automotive
industry’s value chain and product offering, FCA impacts a large
number and wide variety of stakeholders. We aim to create value
through our relationships and connections with customers,
employees, dealers, suppliers and communities, among others.
We recognize that our environmental and social activities affect not
only our aspiration to grow the business but also our commitment to
positively affect our world.

Emerging trends, evolving consumer attitudes and regulatory
requirements influence not only which products and services we
develop, but also how we develop them. FCA incorporates the
concept of a circular economy into our business approach, focusing
on reducing waste in every link in the value chain from vehicle
design through production, distribution, use and eventual reuse of
materials.

Central to FCA’s approach is the belief that effective, lasting
solutions to climate change and other pressing environmental and
social issues can only be achieved through an integrated approach
that combines individual and collective commitment; an effective
multi-stakeholder strategy; investment in enabling premium
processes and technologies; and the incorporation of circular
economy principles in operations. All of these elements are an
integral part of FCA’s model of operating responsibly.

On June 1, 2018, the Group revealed the 2018-2022 business
plan with a focus on technology development: autonomous driving,
vehicle connectivity and electrification deployment. Among other
things, the plan anticipates that we will offer 12 electrified propulsion
systems (battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, full hybrid and mild
hybrid) in global architectures spanning the full range of vehicle
segments. The plan also anticipates that by 2022, 30 nameplates
will feature one or more of these systems.

Our efforts to achieve progress toward the business plan reflects
our commitment to create long-term value responsibly, with full
recognition of the broader role the Company plays.

To achieve our objectives, the Group targets:

© a governance model based on transparency and integrity

safe and sustainable products

© acompetitive product offering and innovative mobility solutions

° effective communication with consumers

* constructive management and professional development of
employees

safe working conditions and respect for human rights

¢ mutually beneficial relationships with business partners and local
communities

processes to reduce impacts on the environment.
