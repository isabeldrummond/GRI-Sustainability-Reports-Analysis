COMPENSATION
AND REWARD

FCA is committed to offering a total compensation system based on
equitable and fair criteria, providing an inclusive work environment
and equal opportunities for workers. By rewarding employees’
abilities and efforts, the Company’s compensation philosophy
acknowledges the value of a high performance culture and the
importance of a market-driven approach.

The Company has defined a compensation system that involves
several components. This comprehensive package rewards
employees for their contribution to the Company’s results, provides
development opportunities, and allows them to share in the business
success they help create.

FCA reviews many factors to determine base salary, benefits and
variable incentives, and strives for fair and objective treatment for
employees around the world. The specific criteria for compensation
adjustments focus on competitiveness with respect to market
position, giving priority to top performers. Variable compensation
and career development are impacted by individual contribution,
which is vigorously evaluated through a common performance and
leadership management framework that is deployed throughout
the entire organization, under which employees are assessed on
an annual basis. Additionally, the Group monitors the application
of our core equity and fairness principles relative to compensation
levels, annual salary reviews and promotions. Managers and human
resource professionals utilize defined guidelines, which are reviewed
annually, in making compensation determinations.

Benefits

In 2018, FCA reviewed the various company compensation
and benefits available to the entire workforce and found that
approximately 72% of employees are eligible for a supplementary
retirement plan. During 2018, approximately 79% of these
employees participated in this type of plan, representing roughly
57% of the total employee base.

Supplementary retirement plans provided by the Group fall into two
categories: defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.

Company-provided health plans are also available for FCA
employees, and more than 73% of the surveyed population
participated in a company-provided health plan. Childcare services
are offered at some locations to help employees achieve work-life
effectiveness by responding to the needs of the family.

The Group promotes a healthy lifestyle through comprehensive
wellness programs and access to dedicated fitness facilities, which
are available in certain areas.

WORK-LIFE BALANCE

FCA offers programs and tools to help employees balance their
personal and professional lives. Depending on the employee location
and local requirements, FCA provides guidelines, processes,
technology enablers, tools, and collaborative workspaces to address
the expectations of an evolving labor market.

Operational needs, the business climate, and compatibility of job
assignments are considered as employees and managers explore
options that enable positive work-life integration. Advancements
in technology have allowed us to rethink traditional processes and
increase efficiency while supporting our commitment to the well-
being of our employees. Arrangements and initiatives to improve
work-life balance include flextime, job-sharing, part-time or reduced
hours, telecommuting, compressed workweek/summer hours,
parental leave and other leaves.

In 2018, an assessment of Group companies revealed that roughly
19% of employees were covered by one or more of the available
flexible working arrangements. Specifically, 3.5% of the workforce
is employed part-time, of which about 52% are women; 2.6% took
parental leave related to childbirth and care; approximately 8.7%
participated in other types of leaves; and 3.8% were covered by other
types of work schedule flexibility (e.g., flexible working hours, working
from home, job-sharing). The actual figure may be considerably
higher, as this percentage does not include participation resulting
from informal agreements with local managers, which may not be
formalized or tracked.

The Group supports equitable choices for maternity, paternity and
adoption benefits, which encourage employees to balance parental
responsibilities with their careers. While labor law requirements may
vary from country to country, parental leaves are provided to all
employees to the extent required to comply with local regulations.
In some countries, the Group exceeds local requirements with
dedicated policies.
