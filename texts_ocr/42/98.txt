> 05_PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY CHAIN _SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT

As directed by Substances of Concern regulations such as the
European Union’s REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization
and Restriction of Chemicals), we require our suppliers to use
chemicals whose contents meet our current standards for the
management of Substances of Concern.

The Group conducts thorough on-site audits to examine the
supplier's environmental management methods. These audits
include a rigorous inspection of proper environmental management
system documents and their mode of distribution in the work
environment; accountability for ensuring compliance with the
environmental management system; training programs provided
to employees; goals to improve environmental performance; and
any environmental certifications held by the supplier. In order to
prevent, mitigate or redress a negative impact encountered during
inspection, a joint action plan is developed with the supplier.

Through recycling or remanufacturing, FCA partners with our
suppliers to reduce the environmental impact of the components
we buy from them. For example, in collaboration with one of our
electric battery suppliers, we developed a program to repurpose
lithium-ion batteries for non-automotive applications such as
motorized wheelchairs. For more information, see the Vehicle End-
of-Life Management section elsewhere in this report.

To promote awareness among suppliers of their potential impact on
climate change, particularly regarding greenhouse gas emissions,
261 suppliers were invited to participate in the CDP Supply Chain
program in 2018. Of those invited, 185 suppliers disclosed (71%
response rate), attaining an average score of B- (on a scale from
AtoD-).

FCA works with CDP to support this engagement and boost
supplier response rates through dedicated supplier training
webinars. This training aims to communicate the importance and
benefits from transparently reporting on impacts. Approximately
78% of responding suppliers reported scope 1 and scope 2
emissions.

By 2020, the Group expects to monitor 90-100% of top Group
suppliers’ CO, emissions (accounting for about 57% of annual
purchases by value) through the CDP supply chain program.
In 2018, disclosing suppliers accounted for approximately 55% of
FCA annual purchases by value from direct and indirect material
suppliers.

SUPPLIER HUMAN RIGHTS
AND LABOR PRACTICES

The respect and support of fundamental human rights is essential
for building a better future for the Company and the communities in
which we do business. This belief is contained in the FCA Human
Rights Guidelines, which the Group promotes within our sphere of
influence. In these Guidelines, we express the expectation we have
of our suppliers, contractors and other business partners to adhere
to these standards.

FCA is conscious of, and continues to be committed to, the safety
and integrity of our global manufacturing supply chain, with special
focus on countries exposed to human rights abuses or armed
conflict. The responsible procurement of raw materials for our
vehicles is vital. Although the source of any raw material may be
several tiers removed in the supply chain, we recognize its place in
our sourcing process.

Through engagement with several multi-stakeholder organizations,
both within and outside the automotive industry, FCA addresses not
only the needs, but the opportunities that exist through ethical and
conscientious procurement practices during the mineral extraction,
trade and processing stages. We are engaged in initiatives such
as the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) Corporate
Responsibility Steering Committee, which leads auto industry
engagement in cobalt, mica, and Conflict Minerals activities and
relationships, and the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI).

FCA‘s approach over the years has been built on assessments and
competency-building initiatives. Self-assessment questionnaires are
used to monitor the suppliers’ management systems with respect
to basic human rights, health and safety in the workplace and fair
working conditions. Suppliers are also expected to establish a
management system to systematically assess occupational health
and safety risks; to measure performance through key indicators;
and to extend their health and safety policies to their contractors.

Finally, FCA expects suppliers to take appropriate steps to prevent
child labor and forced or compulsory labor, as well as to recognize
the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining.
