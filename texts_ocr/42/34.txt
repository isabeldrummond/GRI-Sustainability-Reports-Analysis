The auditable universe of FCA companies is assessed annually
for significant risks, including those related to corruption on the
basis of quantitative criteria: location, activity, and sector, as well
as qualitative criteria such as interviews with senior management
and professional opinions. The most relevant risks arising from
the assessment are audited to ensure 100% coverage every three
years of all commercial companies, and every five years for all other
companies.

Human Rights

The Group is committed to the prevention of adverse human rights
conditions. FCA requires adherence to internationally recognized
principles for the respect and support of fundamental human rights
in all geographic areas where the Group operates.

FCA promotes these principles and expects our suppliers,
contractors and other business partners, with whom we do
business, to adhere to these standards.

The FCA Human Rights Guidelines, which are publicly available, are
consistent with the spirit and intent of the United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights (Ruggie Framework), the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Companies, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles
and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organization, and the
U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015.

The Human Rights Guidelines cover the rights we seek to ensure for,
and with, our major stakeholders:

Employees: FCA prohibits the use of child and forced labor. We seek
to provide a diverse and inclusive workplace, free from discrimination
and harassment. We recognize and respect workforce membersâ€™
freedom of association and are committed to providing employment
conditions that are competitive and compliant with all applicable
employment, wage and working hour laws. FCA conducts all of
our worldwide operations with the highest regard for the health and
safety of our workforce in accordance with applicable laws and is
dedicated to consistently improving health and safety measures to
help ensure that the potential for injury in the workplace is minimized.

Customers: FCA is committed to offering safe, reliable, high-quality
vehicles to our customers.

Communities: FCA is committed to socially responsible engagement
with the communities where we have operations.

Business partners and suppliers: FCA expects our suppliers,
contractors and other business partners with whom we do business,
to adhere to our human rights standards. They are also required
to comply with all occupational health and safety related rules and
regulations, and to adopt measures and standards that contribute
to an overall improvement in occupational health and safety
performance throughout the value chain.

Our due diligence processes include actions to safeguard against
human rights abuses in our business and in our supply chain.
