Insurable Environmental Risks

FCA uses an innovative environmental risk management
methodology developed in collaboration with Environment,
Health and Safety (EHS) departments across the Group, a major
international consultancy and certification firm, and an insurance
partner. This program, which has become a cornerstone of the loss
prevention activities of FCA, enables the Group to:

e obtain objective and quantified assessments of its insurable
environmental exposures

e improve risk profiles of each functional area to minimize
environmental risk costs

° understand and clearly communicate priorities and benefits

e inform the insurance market of activities to prevent and mitigate
potential environmental losses

¢ obtain environmental insurance coverage appropriate to the level
of risk exposure and potential loss

° execute prevention activities in line with Group strategies.

Ninety-two percent of FCA’s worldwide total insured value was
analyzed and quantified using this methodology.

To validate information collected through 68 self-assessments, 23
ad hoc on-site visits have been conducted at Group sites considered
representative in terms of size, activity and geographical distribution,
since the launch of the project. In 2018 alone, there were 25 self-
assessments and 4 ad hoc on-site visits. The visits were conducted
by environmental risk engineers from a leading global environmental
risk insurer to validate the consistency of the self-assessments and
identify possible improvement opportunities.

These activities enable the development of the Group’s environmental
maps, which provide a quantification of the overall level of risk,
using a scientifically-based certified self-assessment tool. Results
presented to the insurance market confirm that FCA's environmental
risks have been adequately identified and quantified and are properly
managed, enabling the Group to secure comprehensive global
insurance coverage.

Earthquake Risk Project

A robust risk management decision-making process requires
quantitative estimates of expected losses due to seismic events.
In the last decade, seismic events affecting industrialized countries
demonstrate that a structured risk-engineering program based on
sound risk estimation is vital to control exposure to potential property
damage and business interruption.

Fiat Chrysler Risk Management, in collaboration with specialized risk
consultants and universities, developed the Integrated Approach to
seismic risk assessment and management, a multi-level framework
that allows simultaneous seismic risk assessment and rational
allocation of available resources. Unlike traditional approaches to
seismic risk, this methodology encompasses individual quantification
of all basic components of that risk: the seismic hazard of the site,

the expected building structural response, and the unique economic
activities and asset values.

In 2018, the collaboration consolidated the application of the
Integrated Approach to key Group sites worldwide. In particular:

e the Level 1 analysis, which is aimed at quantitative and transparent
seismic risk prioritization, covered 14 sites, bringing the total to 77
sites since the launch of the project

e the Level 2 analysis, providing quantitative seismic loss
assessment, was applied to locations identified as top risks
during the Level 1 analysis, bringing the total to five sites since the
launch of the project

e the Level 3 analysis, consisting of on-site earthquake-specialized
loss prevention engineers developing dedicated risk mitigating
recommendations, was not applied to any plants in 2018.

Flood Risk Project

An effective and objective flood risk assessment requires updated
risk maps obtained using advanced modeling tools. To confirm the
effectiveness of FCA methodologies, Fiat Chrysler Risk Management
has formed a working team consisting of specialists from the loss
prevention engineering departments of four recognized insurance
and reinsurance global leaders. Enabled by their natural hazard
research centers, the reinsurance companies provide mapping tools
based on geomorphological satellite imagery and mathematical
modeling for the first macro analysis of the risk portfolio. The
engineering departments of the insurance companies provide
their risk analysis based on visual and instrumental interpretation
techniques along with field checks.

This methodology for industrial flood risk assessment was applied
to 136 sites globally, and identified 78 sites where a second flood
risk study is recommended. Nineteen second level studies were
completed in 2018.

Parking Lot Project

This global project aims to assess and proactively manage natural
hazard risks that expose finished FCA vehicles stored in parking lots
to damage such as fire, hail, natural hazards and external exposure.

An international team comprised of logistics and risk management
specialists and supported by the Group risk engineering provider
developed a risk mapping tool to:

° collect key data to quantify and compare risks on accumulation
and potential exposures

e produce both global exposures and specific hazard risk maps
highlighting top risks and priorities

e define both prevention and protection risk treatment priorities and
outline the most appropriate action plans.

By the end of 2018, the project was expanded to 237 vehicle parking
lots in 35 countries.
