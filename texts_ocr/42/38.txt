RISK MANAGEMENT

The management and mitigation of risks to our
business encompass a broad array of possibilities,
including socio-economic uncertainty; regulatory
initiatives; competitive actions; industrial accidents;
natural disasters; risks posed by climate change;
liability claims and lawsuits; portfolio management
and investor decisions; employee health, safety,
and retention issues; and similar exposures within
the FCA supply chain.

Whether considering local, regional or global risks, their impact
can range from minor to significant. They are often tangible —
usually quantified in financial terms — or more qualitative, such as
reputational risk among consumers, business partners or investors.
After first identifying the risks, we take preemptive steps to reduce
the likelihood of occurrence, develop plans for responding to events
should they occur, and where possible and economically feasible,
secure insurance to cover potential losses.

The three primary elements of the globally-integrated FCA
approach are:

e the Enterprise Risk Management process, which increases
visibility to key risks that could hinder FCA’s ability to achieve our
strategic goals. All regions collaborate to identify and prioritize
risks based on impact and vulnerability, determine the acceptable
risk tolerance, and monitor mitigation actions and risk metrics for
key global risks throughout the year.

the Business Continuity Management process, which establishes
and validates a structured approach to restoring normal business
operations after major disruptions - typically those events that
impair production across multiple days and/or manufacturing plants
the Loss Prevention process, which identifies conditions that
could result in property and business interruption losses; assigns
probability and estimates the impact; implements optimized
prevention, protection, and risk transfer countermeasures; and
monitors the process for effectiveness. These activities are not
only focused on the more common fire and natural hazard risks,
but have been extended to several other pure risks through the
development of innovative risk engineering solutions.

The risk management process used by FCA is a factor in our
sustainable development and provides a competitive advantage in a
fast-changing and challenging global business environment.

ENTERPRISE
RISK MANAGEMENT

FCA’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) model defines a risk as
any event that could impact the Company's ability to achieve its
objectives.

Our approach to managing those risks is based on the framework
established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) and was adapted to the unique
needs of the Group. Adhering to the core elements of business
planning, execution, monitoring and adapting allows us to manage
by making informed, risk-based decisions. By incorporating best
practices identified during evaluations of other industrial groups, we
can better respond to new requirements or to significant emerging
issues such as climate change, macroeconomic developments, or
joint ventures. More than 50 risk drivers have been identified, which
are further broken down into approximately 100 potential events.

The analysis of potential risks is:

e dynamic: due to periodic evaluation of the main risks with
follow-up and monitoring of mitigating actions identified and/or
implemented

predictive: through prospective risk assessment

cross-functional: through risk assessment with direct involvement
of business areas.

We appoint ERM coordinators for each operating segment of the
Group. They coordinate and conduct cross-functional meetings with
the heads of key operating segments. These meetings provide the
forum to facilitate discussion, identify and evaluate potential risks,
and formulate risk mitigation plans.

An enterprise risk assessment is performed annually, based on a
bottom-up approach beginning with the functional areas, and
concludes with the review by the regional Risk Management
Committee. Regional/company Chief Executive Officers and/or
Chief Operating Officers of these operating segments review and
approve their respective risk assessments and submit these results
to the central ERM team. The central team consolidates results
into a Group report for review and validation with the Global Risk
Management Committee and Group Executive Council. As part of
the consolidation, significant global focus risks are identified and risk
dashboards are created to monitor major risk indicators as well as
current and go-forward mitigation efforts. Once validated, results are
submitted to the Audit Committee, assisting the Board of Directors
in their responsibility for strategic oversight of risk management
activities.
