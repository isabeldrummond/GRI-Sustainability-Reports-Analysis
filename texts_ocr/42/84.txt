As the needs of our customers around the world continue to evolve,
so does the value of personalization and easy access to information.
FCA provides opportunities for customers to interact with the dealer
network; research products and services; and learn about our
brands through a wide variety of channels, often before an in-person
sales or service experience.

Vehicle shopping solutions in various markets use virtual and
augmented reality to enable customers to customize and experience
vehicle details in real-time, even when they do not have access to
the physical vehicle. Initiatives like the Abarth AR (Augmented
Reality) and the Jeep Adventure Reality applications for mobile
devices offer customers a cyber experience to help them configure
the vehicle and make their purchase decisions. A similar approach
was launched in 2017 in Turin (Italy) that allows potential customers
to configure an FCA vehicle through an immersive experience using
virtual reality headsets. The solution was made available during
2018 in other countries at temporary or pop-up stores in highly
frequented areas such as shopping malls. In addition, FCA provides
customers in selected countries, directly or through partnerships
with major providers, the ease and convenience of shopping for a
vehicle online. This approach allows customers to take delivery of
the vehicles at their local dealers, combining online purchasing with
human interaction.

FCA also offers innovative features and solutions to support new and
unique market expectations. For example, connected services such
as the Uconnect Skill for Amazon Alexa allows vehicle owners to
conveniently search for destinations from the comfort of their home,
then send it their vehicle for easy navigation directions.

Dealer Network Development

The dealer network plays a pivotal role in developing relationships
and building trust with FCA’s customers. To support the role of the
network, FCA develops training programs to enhance sales and
service personnel knowledge and skills. The Group offers targeted
training through live and web-based courses, including online tools
such as virtual classrooms, tablet applications and in-dealership
mobile tools.

Training content varies by market and changes over time to
reflect brand presence, model launches, process improvements,
customer expectations and advancements in vehicle features.
Content included in training developed for sales, after-sales and
technical personnel covers an extensive range of topics, such as
customer experienced-based processes and skills; product and
vehicle systems knowledge; and environmental and safety features
of the Group’s vehicles. Depending on the topic, dealer personnel
demonstrate comprehensive knowledge by completing a series of
courses, skills assessments and certifications.

Developing the network goes beyond providing training and
communication tools for existing network employees. It also means
looking forward and supporting additional educational opportunities.
Examples of such programs include:

e Degrees@Work and Degrees@Work Family programs. U.S.
dealership employees and their families are offered the opportunity
to receive a no-cost, no-debt college degree. The programs
enable dealerships to attract top talent, improve the skill set of
existing employees, lessen the burden of paying for college for
families and increase employee retention. By the end of 2018,
more than 3,300 dealership employees and family members have
taken advantage of this opportunity.

Mopar Career Automotive Program (CAP). This study and
internship program is offered by a network of schools in the U.S.
that utilize an FCA-specific curriculum to train high-potential,
entry-level automotive technicians for employment at FCA
dealerships. Mopar CAP has created strategic partnerships with
automotive technical colleges primarily in metropolitan areas of
the U.S. In addition, Mopar CAP LOCAL, which was established
in 2015, continues to grow the network of schools in the U.S. by
enlisting schools in secondary and rural markets. At the end of
2018, there were 96 Mopar CAP and CAP LOCAL schools, an
increase of approximately 8% over 2017, supporting more than
8,900 active students.

TechPro? program. This international project is a three-year
program for selected students who receive theoretical and practical
knowledge from Salesian Vocational Training Center instructors
who have received professional training by FCA employees. The
training centers are designed and equipped by FCA and reflect
the same service standards as the FCA dealer network. Second
and third-year students gain important hands-on experience
through internships and apprenticeships. In 2018, more than 650
students in Italy were enrolled in TechPro? apprenticeships, with
41% of them within the FCA dealer network. Around the world,
more than 5,000 students, including the students in Italy, took
part in the program and received approximately 4.5 million hours
of training in seven languages and 60 locations.
