In 2018, FCA announced the planned transformation of the Fiat
Rivalta plant in Italy into a PDC serving Europe, the Middle East, Africa
and additional markets. This former vehicle production plant will be
converted into an energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable parts
and accessories storage and distribution warehouse. The new facility
will support over 5,000 locations, significantly improving delivery time to
dealerships, increasing customer service as a result.

The environmental performance of our PDCs is monitored regularly.
Results are communicated and shared among employees to increase
their level of awareness and encourage direct involvement in initiatives
aimed at improving sustainability performance.

In the LATAM region, the PDC in Hortolandia (Brazil) neutralized its
carbon emissions in 2018. The impact on the climate became zero as
a result of its use of 100% renewable energy, cleaner fuels, and the
quantification, reduction and compensation of CO, emissions. The
results of these activities were certified by a third party.
