A protected area (site of regional, national or EU importance, special protection zone, oasis, etc) is a geographically defined area that is designated, regulated or managed to achieve specific conservation
objectives. An area of high biodiversity value is an area that is not subject to legal protection, but is recognized by governmental and non-governmental organizations for its significant biodiversity.

FCA reported no significant direct or indirect impacts on biodiversity.
FCA reports only on locations or plants included in protected areas or that have an active biodiversity project in their respective areas.
