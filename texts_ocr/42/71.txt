We pursue compliance with fuel economy and greenhouse gas
regulations in the markets where we operate through the most
cost effective combination of developing, manufacturing and selling
vehicles with better fuel economy and lower emissions, purchasing
compliance credits and paying regulatory penalties. The cost of each
of these components of our strategy has increased and is expected
to continue to increase in the future. As the costs of each of these
components, particularly the relative costs of each component,
changes, we intend to adjust our strategies in an effort to maintain
the most cost effective means of complying with the regulations.

The 2018-2022 business plan presented our expectation to continue
reducing CO, emissions through a collection of technologies that will
vary by market, and align with the vehicle mix, consumer needs and
regulatory framework.

The regulatory environment outlook across our four major regions
shows continued consistent CO, reductions, ranging from 25-30%
between 2018 and 2024. This anticipated regulatory stringency
balanced with customer preferences guides research and
development for future products and will be highlighted below by
region and key product segment.

NAFTA

The U.S. policy is complex with three separate CO, regulations, but it
also contains a flexible array of new technology incentives to encourage
industry movement toward an electrified future. For instance, U.S.
regulation includes a tax credit to consumers of up to $7,500 to jump
start demand, which is required given relatively low fuel prices and
increasing consumer preference for SUVs and trucks in the market.

American consumers tend to have long commutes and ready access to
charging capability at home. FCA plans, by 2022, for 20% of our overall
fleet (including commercial vehicles) to be high voltage, with a focus
on plug-in systems, 15% of the fleet to be equipped with mild hybrid
systems and 65% to retain conventional internal combustion engines.

LATAM

With its ability to grow sugar cane in high volume, Brazil is able to
address CO, reduction with a different approach. Today about 30% of
vehicle fuel usage in Brazil consists of sugar cane produced ethanol.
Sugar cane ethanol is 80% renewable from “well” (or field) to wheels
and provides approximately 12.5% CO, reduction on an equivalent
30/70 fuel mix E100/E22 basis. The Brazilian government recently
launched a plan (RenovaBio) to improve quality and productiveness
of ethanol, targeting an increase of share on Ethanol E100 in the fuel
matrix from the current 30% to 40% in 2022 and to 55% in 2030. In
addition, the Brazilian government and FCA are working very closely
on research and development opportunities to further reduce CO,
emissions through improvements to ethanol-fueled engines.

Brazilian consumers already widely use ethanol fuel, readily available
in the current retail fuel market. FCA believes that Brazilian fleet CO,
reduction targets will be met through 2025 with increased usage and
efficiency of its ethanol based engines and without any high voltage
electrification.

APAC

China is leading the rapid change in this region. The Chinese
government has stated intentions to become the global leader in
electrification in the next decade. The regulatory policies include
credit multipliers and incentives for new energy vehicles which are
defined as battery electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell vehicles.

Some large cities provide consumers with license plate incentives
for new energy vehicles. Given these incentives can be as high as
€11,000 per vehicle, we believe they will be successful in driving the
market toward electrification.

From a consumer perspective, China has the highest number of first
time car buyers in the world. Since much of the vehicle consumer
demographic resides in urban areas, access to public charging
is expected to be a critical element to achieving China’s electrified
objectives.

FCA’s plan is, by 2022, for 15% of the overall fleet (including
commercial vehicles) to use high voltage electrification, with the
highest penetration of full battery electric of any region, 20% of the
fleet to be equipped with a hybrid system and 65% of the fleet to
retain conventional internal combustion engines.

In contrast to China, India continues to be a very cost sensitive market
with a developing infrastructure. As a result, increased regulatory
requirements are expected to be met through application of shared
conventional technologies with limited dependence on electrification.

EMEA

Europe represents the most challenging combination of regulatory
stringency and consumer price sensitivity. The EU is driving a step
function reduction in CO, in 2020, and metropolitan areas are
implementing low emission zones in an attempt to improve air quality
in city centers. Conventional internal combustion engine applications
will likely be restricted, especially with aging vehicles. The CO,
financial penalty structure is very significant.

Many consumers in Europe need reduced cost of vehicle ownership
given high fuel prices and pressure on disposable income. As the
demand for diesels continues to decrease, FCA intends to use
mild hybrids as a replacement. The region will need to address
the development of charging infrastructure so that zero emission
vehicles are more convenient for consumers.

FCA’s plan is, by 2022, for 20% of the overall fleet (including
commercial vehicles) to use high voltage electrification, 40% of the
fleet to be equipped with a mild hybrid system and 40% to retain
conventional internal combustion engines.
