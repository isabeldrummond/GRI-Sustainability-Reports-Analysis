Engaging Associations
and Institutions
FCA’s approach to engaging public institutions, industry

associations, and other organizations aims to make a positive
contribution to business conditions that are competitive, as well as
sustainable over the long term.

In Europe, the Group belongs to trade associations such as
the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA)
for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. ACEA represents
manufacturers with production sites in the European Union (EU).
The Association’s mission is to define common interests, policies
and positions in the framework of a dialogue with European
institutions and other stakeholders. In addition, ACEA is engaged
in communication activities about the role and importance of the
automotive sector for the entire EU economy, and undertakes a

priority areas: connected and automated driving; competitiveness,
market and economy; environment and sustainability; international
trade; research and innovation; safety; and transport policy.

automakers. The group’s mission is to promote policies that support
automakers in building cars and light trucks that are safe, reliable,
energy efficient, clean and smart. The organization provides a unified
voice on behalf of FCA US and the U.S. auto industry on regulatory
and legislative matters at the federal and state levels.

In Brazil, the Group has long been an active member of the
