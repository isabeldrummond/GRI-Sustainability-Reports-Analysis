Additionally, a new cubing methodology for parts was introduced
for inbound truck transportation. We avoided more than 4,000 tons
of CO, and reduced transport by approximately 4.2 million km by
working with partners to optimize daily material releases and more
fully utilize transportation resources.

PACKAGING AND PROTECTIVE
MATERIALS

FCA works to reduce packaging and protective material consumption
while meeting quality requirements and reducing the risk of damage.
Each packaging solution must be uniquely adapted to both the
individual part and the destination plant. To reduce waste, this also
means identifying or creating a reusable solution when possible.
Where reusable containers are not the optimal solution, the Group
seeks to apply recovery processes which enable repurposing of the
material.

Investments in the returnable container fleet and improvements in
container fleet management allow greater flexibility in scheduling and
decreased demand for expendable packaging. Initiatives include:

e A program to recycle more than 136,000 wooden pallets saved
over €330,000 in 2018 while lowering the environmental impacts
of producing and delivering those pallets.

e FCA optimizes the management of returnable containers in
North America through a Regional Container Pooling Center
for upstream freight. This process efficiently directs containers
where needed, resulting in a reduction in transportation costs,
travel time for containers, handling costs, and possible double
handling. In 2018, the Regional Container Pooling Initiative
avoided approximately 1,700 tons of CO, emissions.

e FCA continued container audits in 2018, resulting in the recovery
and proper allocation of more than 80,000 returnable containers
from 221 supplier locations in North America. These reclaimed
assets further reduced the need for expendable cardboard
packaging.

e Packaging insert reuse programs implemented during 2018 led to
the diversion of approximately 100 tons of packaging waste from
landfill and saved more than €140,000.

e For international shipments, several density improvements,
packaging optimization initiatives and the shift to different materials
resulted in a reduction of nearly 500 tons of wood and more than
70 tons of cardboard.

PARTS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS

FCA has more than 50 Parts Distribution Centers (PDC) worldwide
which are responsible for warehousing and managing the efficient
delivery of spare parts to our dealers and distributors.

Our PDCs are progressively adopting World Class Logistics (WCL),
an approach based on World Class Manufacturing, that seeks
to enhance safety, ergonomic and eco-compatibility as well as
transport flow optimization. WCL also helps to significantly reduce
the environmental footprint of logistics activities at PDCs, reducing
waste while enabling a productive and efficient high-volume flow of
goods and materials.

The PDCs in Centerline and Winchester (U.S.) achieved the WCL
Bronze Level in 2018, along with the None and Volvera (Italy) PDCs
which were already Silver Level. In addition, all FCA Parts Distribution
Centers located in the U.S., Canada and Mexico are ISO 14001
certified, with 12 of these sending zero process waste to landfill. Two
U.S. PDCs achieved LEED certification; the Romulus facility is a U.S.
Green Building LEED Gold certified building; the Winchester facility is a
U.S. Green Building LEED Silver certified facility.

FCA works to improve efficiency in the transportation of parts both to
and from our PDCs. FCA is piloting a process for more efficient trailer
loading, showing more than a 20% increase in trailer cube utilization and
an overall reduction in distance traveled.

To more efficiently stock and move parts, we have developed a
demand forecasting tool to better predict which parts and quantities are
needed in specific markets. The goal is to provide excellent service for
customers by meeting the demand for parts, while maintaining optimal
inventory levels.
