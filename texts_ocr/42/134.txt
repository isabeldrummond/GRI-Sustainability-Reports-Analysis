DEFINITIONS, METHODOLOGY AND SCOPE

The FCA NV Sustainability Report, now in its 14"
edition, is a voluntary document issued by the
Group according to GRI Sustainability Reporting
Standards issued in 2016 by the GRI-Global
Reporting Initiative” to provide stakeholders a
comprehensive picture of FCA activities, results
and commitments in the economic, environmental
and social spheres.

This appendix provides a methodology guide.

Unless otherwise specified or required by the context in which they
are used:

e the terms “FCA,” “Group” and “Company” refer to all
companies consolidated within Fiat Chrysler Automobiles
N.V. for accounting purposes (see subsidiaries consolidated
in the FCA NV Annual Report)

e the term “company” is used with reference to a selection among
the following entities: FCA Italy, FCA US, Maserati, Comau, Teksid,
FCA Services and other companies

e the term “FCA US’ refers to all companies consolidated within FCA
US LLC for accounting purposes (see subsidiaries consolidated
in the FCA NV Annual Report)

e the term “FCA Italy” refers to all companies consolidated within
FCA Italy S.p.A. for accounting purposes (see subsidiaries
consolidated in the FCA NV Annual Report)

e the term “operating segment” refers to the segments of the
Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer
for making strategic decisions and allocating resources and
assessing performance. They include four regional mass-market
vehicle operating segments: EMEA (Europe, Russia, Middle East
and Africa), NAFTA (U.S., Canada and Mexico), LATAM (South
and Central America) and APAC (Asia and Pacific countries) and
the Maserati global luxury brand operating segment. The results
of our Magneti Marelli business were previously reported within
the Components segment along with our industrial automation
systems design and production business and our cast iron and
aluminum components business. Following the classification of
Magneti Marelli as a discontinued operation for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (refer to the 2018 FCA
Annual Report, Note 3, Scope of consolidation), the remaining

activities within the Components segment are no longer
considered a separate reportable segment as defined by IFRS 8
and are reported within “Other activities.” Other activities include
the results of our industrial automation systems design and
production business and our cast iron and aluminum components
business, as well as the activities and businesses that are not
operating segments under IFRS 8 — Operating Segments.

e the term “customer” as used in this Report refers to the end user
of our products or services.

Unless otherwise indicated or required by the context, the
information and data contained in this Sustainability Report relate to
financial year 2018 (January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018) and to all
FCA companies worldwide falling within the scope of consolidation
at December 31, 2018.

In order to ensure that information is comparable and meaningful
over time, some data for past years was restated to ensure
comparability in terms of scope. This report excludes information
relating to our Magneti Marelli business® to allow comparability with
the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements, where Magneti
Marelli’s operations met the criteria to be classified as a disposal
group held for sale and a discontinued operation pursuant to IFRS
5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Information relating to 2017, 2016 and 2010 has been re-presented
to exclude Magneti Marelli. For historical data and information
previously published and over which the independent auditor carried
out a limited assurance engagement, please refer to 2017 and 2016
Sustainability Reports respectively.

We monitor our operations through the use of several non-generally
accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) financial measures:
Net debt, Net industrial debt, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and
Taxes (Adjusted EBIT) and Adjusted net profit; for reconciliations of
each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable measure included in our Consolidated Financial
Statements, refer to the 2018 FCA Annual Report on the Company’s
website at www.fcagroup.com.

The exclusion of any geographical area, Group company, or specific
site from the scope of reporting is attributable to the inability to
obtain data of satisfactory quality, or to its immateriality in relation
to the Group as a whole, as may be the case for newly-acquired
entities or production activities that are not yet fully operational.

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a multi-stakeholder process for the development and disclosure of Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. The GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards offer an
international reference for the disclosure of governance approach and of the environmental, social and economic performance and impacts of organizations.
® The exclusion only concerns Magneti Marelli discontinued operations; selected minor activities have remained in scope and data related to these have been included throughout the Sustainability

Report within “Plastic Components’, a portion of “Other Activities”
