Talent Attraction

FCA recognizes the ever-evolving expectations of our workforce,
especially as they relate to rewards and challenges that may be
different from those of the past. Aligning FCA’s current and future
needs with skilled professionals, whether those already part of today’s
workforce, or those just beginning their career, makes attracting
and retaining talented individuals a top priority at each step from
recruitment through retirement.

FCA has been involved for 13 years in supporting university teams
that design and manufacture prototypes to compete in the European
Formula SAE events. FCA offers the teams our technical support
during the Italian competition held at the Circuit in Varano de’ Melegari
(Italy).

For five years, FCA has partnered with the Society of Automotive
Engineering's Collegiate Design Series on a car-building competition
that takes students from the classroom to the race course in both
Formula and Baja vehicle classifications. Student teams from several
universities work with more than 60 FCA engineers, and are provided
the opportunity to test their vehicles at the Chelsea Proving Grounds
(U.S.). Through this program, the students develop many of the skills
used at FCA every day, including project management, budgets,
timing, design, building, testing and validation. Many student team
leaders manage teams of 15 - 50 students, helping them build
leadership skills and learn how to manage people to give their best
effort - attributes highly desired in the workplace.

To support FCA efforts to attract the best talent, we sponsor programs
such as the U.S. National Black MBA Association Graduate Student
Case Competition. This annual event enables talented, high-potential
MBA candidates from the nation’s leading business schools to
compete for €43,600 in scholarships. The solution they present gives
these students an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and
problem-solving skills to a multi-sector panel of business executives.

We also have strategic relationships with several universities to
help bridge the gap between the classroom and the Company.
These collaborations are designed to combine classroom education
with hands-on industry-level experience. This gives students the
opportunity to receive specialized instruction that caters to their
career interests, while nurturing the skills needed for FCA’s future
workforce.

In Italy, a new four-year agreement was recently signed to continue
the collaboration between FCA and the Politecnico of Turin for the
Automotive Engineering degree program. This program focuses
on three main areas: teaching, research and internationalization.
FCA employees are involved in lecturing and coordination activities.
In 2018, FCA granted €1.6 million to support this degree program.

Talent Management, Retention
and Succession Planning

FCA provides the means for our workers to grow professionally,
which helps us retain and develop talented and motivated
employees. The Human Resources organization, managers and all
other employees share duties and responsibility in this development,
and this cooperation creates an attractive working environment and
a workforce equipped to respond to the challenges of our industry.

Performance and Leadership Management (PLM) is the appraisal
system adopted worldwide to assess the performance of
management, professional and salaried employees. This individual
performance assessment process is one of the elements upon
which the variable compensation is based.

The PLM process provides the framework for talent management
and succession planning. This rigorous, global process helps identify
individuals with the technical and managerial skills needed for FCA
and our employees to succeed.

Through PLM, specific targets are established to guide and assess
employees in relation to their results and behaviors. Complete
performance and leadership evaluations were conducted during
2018 for approximately 53,000 FCA employees. Sustainability
targets are embedded into the business and thus are part of
organizational objectives used for annual performance evaluations.
This process encompasses virtually all salaried employees, with
further details to be found in the Facts and Figures section of this
report.

Talent reviews and succession planning processes are designed
to create opportunities for individuals to develop the leadership
skills necessary to further FCA’s future growth. Such opportunities
include assignments to other geographic or business areas as well
as engagement with senior management. Approximately 6,000
internal mobility opportunities were made available to FCA salaried
and hourly employees worldwide. This approach helps protect the
Company's future, leveraging our workforce by preparing the next
leaders for their roles.
