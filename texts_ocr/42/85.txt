Customer Support

FCA provides a variety of communication channels for our
customers throughout the ownership experience that offer not only
product information but also specific support within the markets.
Examples range from online chatbots to smartphone applications
that allow users to schedule service appointments and receive
recall information. These solutions provide convenient access to
information and improved customer service.

To strengthen connections with our customers and address
customer complaints, FCAâ€™s social media teams monitor digital
media channels, such as Facebook, Twitter and automotive blogs.
Owner sites are available within most markets to provide our
customers with information about vehicle maintenance and services;
accessories and merchandise; and vehicle recalls.

In addition to websites, smartphone applications and digital media
channels, FCA has dedicated customer contact organizations in
all regions to ensure strong and global management of customer
contact activities worldwide. Customer Contact Centers (CCC),
together with dealers, are among the primary channels of
communication between customers and the Company. There are 26
CCCs worldwide, with approximately 1,500 agents and supervisors
who handled approximately 28 million customer contacts in 2018,
offering a variety of services including information, complaint
management and, in some locations, roadside assistance.

FCA Customer Contact Centers manage the entire process, from the
first contact with the customer until a response is given or a concern
is resolved, ensuring resolution in the shortest possible time. They
provide multilingual support with a strong focus on employing native
speakers of 28 languages. FCA believes that skilled, knowledgeable
and motivated agents are essential for a high level of customer
satisfaction. For this reason, in 2018 the Group offered nearly 99,000
hours of agent training on new products, behaviors and processes,
as well as systems and new procedures.

FCA took a significant step in recall customer outreach in the U.S. in
2018 by launching an all-new Customer Relationship Management
system for our CCC specialists. The planning, process and actual
contacts for all recall outreach, including phone, postal mail and
digital, is now managed by the Customer Care team.

FCA also regularly engages with customers to provide information
regarding the proper use of our products and services; potential
risks or hazards; safety and usage instructions; disposal of the
vehicles; and warnings. This information is provided through a variety
of methods including owner and maintenance manuals; information
labels and product advertising; the dealer and service network; and
Customer Contact Centers, among others. With our global focus,
the Group sells our products and services to consumers in more
than 135 countries worldwide, and is subject to numerous laws and
regulations governing product information.
