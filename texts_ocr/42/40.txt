LOSS PREVENTION
MANAGEMENT

Natural hazards can threaten the Group’s physical assets and
business continuity. Industrial losses from natural disasters such as
earthquakes, flooding, tornadoes or severe storms, are on the rise.
Climate change will further alter the magnitude and frequency of
these incidents, and may introduce new hazards in areas that have
not previously experienced them.

FCA employs a risk management policy strongly focused on loss
prevention and mitigation to help prevent property damage that
could result in interruptions to our business. To be effective, loss
prevention must be embedded in day-to-day activities, in new
projects and initiatives, and is supported and promoted by the
organization’s highest levels of management.

More than 10 years ago, FCA created a center of competence whose
mission is to develop advanced and innovative engineering solutions
related to physical risks created by natural events. The goal of the
competence center is to reduce the detection time of new natural
hazard risk-related events and to quickly initiate loss prevention or
mitigation practices and procedures. Its focus is the allocation of
resources and efforts among risk reduction, risk sharing, disaster
response and recovery efforts.

Specific activities include monitoring and insuring against pure
risks - such as fire, explosions, and natural disasters - and playing a
central role in managing events that have the potential to impact the
continuity of operations or integrity of physical assets at the Group’s
1,033 sites worldwide covered by the insurance programs.

Our Risk Management policy aims to ensure that the Group has a
consistent basis for measuring, controlling, monitoring and reporting
risk at all levels. Four pillars describe our approach:

© preventing accidents or mitigating their effects

e adopting higher international standards for risk prevention

e minimizing the cost of risk by optimizing loss prevention,
investment, self-insurance and risk transfer programs

¢ centralizing and consolidating relationships with global insurance
markets.

The Loss Prevention Management process is conducted with the
support of external consulting firms that specialize in industrial risk.
They use field audits to provide an impartial, in-depth and consistent
assessment of risk across the Group.

During 2018, FCA’s risk management entities were responsible for
managing 151 sites worldwide, representing 82% of total insured
value, based on 2019 insured values. To ensure that industrial risk
is adequately and efficiently monitored, more than 95% of FCA’s
total insured value managed by Fiat Chrysler Risk Management
is surveyed at least once every three years and more than 50% is
surveyed annually. In 2018, 77 sites, representing approximately
81% of FCA‘s insured value, and 198 new projects were inspected
or monitored to ensure conformity with international standards in
loss prevention.

In 2018, FCA invested €21.2 million in targeted loss prevention and
physical risk mitigation measures that led to a reduction in overall
loss expectancies of approximately €0.94 billion during the year.
Figures relate to the insurance year from July 1, 2017 to June 30,
2018.

By concentrating and strictly controlling the fire protection investments
at selected vital sites, an overall Global Efficiency Index (GEl) of 2.27
was achieved, representing a reduction of €100 of Loss Expectancy
for every €2.27 invested. The Global Efficiency Index for loss mitigation
(GEl = cost of protection/reduction of expected damage) is recognized
as a measure of effectiveness for industrial risk management. These
actions made it possible for FCA to maintain 74% of the total insured
values certified by the insurance market as Highly Protected Risk (HPR).
The HPR system reflects the highest level of loss prevention practice
and protection standards in combating property damage risks. Such
practice and protection standards must be assessed and certified by
external, internationally-recognized experts.

To bolster the sustainability and resilience of the Group, the
risk management function launched several forward-looking
and innovative risk engineering approaches and solutions to
better understand the impacts of natural hazards and respond
appropriately. The ability to assess losses and costs associated
with natural hazards is essential for better hazard mitigation. This
proactive approach will continue to reduce the detection time of
newly developing or changing risks, and to promptly adapt the FCA
loss prevention and mitigation practices and procedures.

The following projects are core operational activities:

e insurable environmental risk management
e earthquake risk re-engineering project

e flood risk re-engineering project

parking lot risk management

e supplier risk management

cyber risk management.

Further, the Group is developing ways to analyze the risk of tornadoes
at the most exposed sites, while identifying countermeasures to
mitigate their impact.
