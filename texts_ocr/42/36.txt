In the U.S., we have targeted actions in support of the U.S. EPA/
NHTSA's goal of increasing industry year-over-year average fleet
wide fuel economy performance. We have set year-over-year fuel
economy reduction targets, including the achievement of at least a
five to 15% improvement in fuel economy for major renewals of FCA
US vehicles compared with replaced vehicles/models. This target
has been achieved, and in some cases surpassed, in the years since
it was established.

Global goals for our manufacturing plants include:

* reducing energy consumed per vehicle produced by 30% from
2010 to 2020

* reducing CO, emissions per vehicle produced by 32% from 2010
to 2020

¢ reducing water consumption per vehicle produced by 40% from
2010 to 2020.

FCA is also helping mobilize suppliers to become actively involved in
cutting greenhouse gas emissions: we have set a target to monitor
CO, emissions of at least 90% of top suppliers (accounting for about
57% of purchases by value) by 2020.

Transacting Business Legally

Included in the FCA Code of Conduct’s Principle “Transacting
Business Legally” are, among others, rules related to anti-bribery,
anti-corruption, competition law and government and public
institution relations.

FCA is committed to compliance with all applicable anti-corruption
laws that govern our operations. No FCA director, officer, employee,
agent, or business partner may directly or indirectly, give, offer,
promise, or authorize bribes, kickbacks, payoffs, or other improper
payments or transfers of anything of value to any government official
with the intention to influence such official in the performance of his or
her official functions and thereby secure a business advantage. FCA
also prohibits facilitating payments or “grease payments” as well as
commercial bribery, i.e., transactions not involving government officials.

These principles apply to third parties that act on FCA’s behalf.
Each FCA company that engages third parties to act on its behalf
must ensure that such representatives sign written agreements that
contain clauses that require their compliance with anti-corruption
laws, and that the representatives are subject to the Company’s
applicable due diligence procedures, if any.

FCA also conducts appropriate due diligence investigations prior
to any merger and acquisition transaction, and ensures that the
final agreements in any such transactions include appropriate
anti-corruption representations, warranties and related clauses.

FCA\‘s record keeping and internal accounting and control Practices
and Procedures are designed to ensure integrity and accuracy in the
recording and reporting of all business transactions.

Alleged violations are reported through the FCA Ethics Helpline,
as well as through the same channels as other types of potential
violations.

Compliance with competition laws is also crucial to the Group’s
reputation. To fulfill FCA’s commitment to compliance in this
area in all countries where we do business, FCA has adopted a
comprehensive compliance program, which includes Competition
Guidelines, periodic training, awareness and counseling.

When dealing with our business partners, our workforce is expected
to always maintain the highest degree of integrity and to act solely in
the best interests of the Company.

Conflicts of interest may arise when members of FCA’s workforce
engage in activities or have interests that compromise the interests of
our Company, because these activities or interests may compromise
objective business decision making or otherwise interfere with the
performance of work-related duties.

Thus, in order to assist the workforce in the management of conflicts
of interest or any potential conflicts, in 2018 the Group implemented
a new module to submit a disclosure through the FCA Ethics
Helpline.

As reported in the FCA Code of Conduct, the Group is committed to
conducting our government and public institution relations, including
lobbying, in accordance with applicable laws and ethics rules as well as
in full compliance with the Code and any applicable local procedures.

Political contributions by the Group are only allowed where permitted
by law and must be authorized at the appropriate level within each
Group company. In 2018, no contributions were made by FCA to
political parties.

Legal Proceedings

Various legal proceedings, claims and governmental investigations
are pending against the Group on a wide range of topics. The Group
monitors the status of pending legal procedures and consults with
experts on a regular basis.

During 2018, the Group has not received an individual final judgment, or
group of related final judgments, relating to a breach of i) environmental
legislation, ii) rights of local communities, iii) privacy, iv) product liability,
v) corruption, vi) unfair competition, intellectual property and antitrust,
vii) contractual liability, viii) product and service information and labeling,
ix) litigation with suppliers or x) human rights that would be considered
material to the Group's operations.
