Engaging Youth

Many of FCA\‘s sustainability events are designed to engage youth,
particularly millennials, in dialogue about the future of mobility. These
activities range from classroom working groups and presentations in
high schools and universities, to role-playing exercises. In addition,
several departments at FCA regularly reach out to students to
engage them in design or science, technology, engineering and
math (STEM)-related initiatives.

Summer Intern Event

During 2018, we turned to our student interns for a fresh look on two
important topics: the future of mobility and human rights in the supply
chain. Student interns represent a rich cross-section of constituents.
They are members of our workforce during their internship; they are
consumers; they are part of the academic community; and they are
future leaders in the public and/or private sectors.

Workshops held in our U.S. technology center served a two-fold
purpose: our interns learned about sustainability at FCA, and we, in
turn, furthered our understanding of the economic, environmental
and social impacts that the Company and our stakeholders are
facing. To make things more interesting for all involved, the two
events were structured around role-playing.

At the first event, the students broke into teams, with each
assuming the identity of a major player in the automotive eco-
system: manufacturer, technology or mobility service provider, utility
company, community leader and consumer. The challenge was to
identify what the business of moving people and goods will look like
in 2025 from a variety of perspectives, and evaluate how mobility
can more explicitly benefit society. The teams presented a diverse
set of ideas focused on bringing affordable, accessible, efficient,
safe and enjoyable mobility to a broader consumer base, while
easing urban congestion. Among the concepts that were explored
were autonomous and connected vehicles, shared rides, partial
ownership, electrification and the subscription model.

The second workshop consisted of interns working in our
Purchasing and Supply Chain Management organizations, whose
challenge was the topic of responsible sourcing, specifically related
to the safety and integrity of the global supply chain with respect to
potential human rights issues. Our interns learned that FCA believes
the responsible procurement of raw materials for our vehicles
is essential, even if the source of the raw material is several tiers
removed in our supply chain. By taking on the roles of automaker,
Tier 1 supplier, sub-Tier supplier, nonprofit organization, and worker,
the students examined a multi-stakeholder approach to this issue
that involves a collaborative effort among the various industries,
regulatory agencies, non-governmental organizations, customers,
and suppliers.

Engaging the Supply Chain

Because suppliers represent such an essential element in FCA’s
value chain, we engage extensively with them on sustainability
topics. This engagement includes, among other activities, a
dedicated sustainability class as a component of Supplier Training
Week; one-on-one benchmarking and mentoring; and coordinating
peer-to-peer coaching activities. Topics include aspects of FCA's
expectations for suppliers, including responsible working conditions,
environmental impact, ethics, and tools for reporting to FCA.

In Brazil, FCA conducted training with leading suppliers on climate
change and greenhouse gas inventory. We also participated in an
initiative promoted by the industry association FIEMG in partnership
with FCA in the State of Minas Gerais, aimed at strengthening the
automotive industry. This project focused on helping to increase
productivity and competitiveness among micro- and small-sized
companies within the automotive supply chain.
