CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE

   
 

 

The foundation of FCAâ€™s governance model is the Code of KEY FIGURES
Conduct and a collection of supporting statements, including

guidelines, that reflect our commitment to a culture dedicated

to integrity, responsibility and ethical behavior. 1

The Company governance model regulates the decision- Code of Conduct
making processes and the approach used by the Company
and our employees in interacting with all stakeholders.

 

This model is supported by the whistleblowing process for
reporting situations, events, or actions which may be inconsistent 1 2 Principles
with the FCA Code of Conduct; an advanced risk management for ethical behavior

system; and an ongoing alignment with international best
practice and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
