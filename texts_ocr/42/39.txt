Key global risks identified in 2018 include risks related to product
quality and customer satisfaction; product portfolio and technology
strategy; technology development and product launch; talent
management; interruption of critical supplies and supplier quality;
regulatory compliance and commercial policies. Each key global
focus risk has been classified by risk categories and control
measures and mitigating actions are subsequently defined for each
identified risk.

For further details, see Significant Risks Identified and Control
Measures Taken in the 2018 FCA Annual Report.

BUSINESS CONTINUITY
MANAGEMENT

Managing business operations and returning to normal production
schedules when a catastrophic event causes a major disruption
requires planning and discipline. These potential events include
natural disasters, pandemics, facility issues, cyberattacks, or
unforeseen events within our supply chain. Our business continuity
management is a structured and disciplined approach to reducing
the likelihood and severity of disruptions, and reducing recovery time
in the event of a disruption.

The business continuity management process has four elements:

° Critical production processes for each plant are mapped to key
inputs, including facility infrastructure, process equipment, data
technology, human resources, and suppliers. Current recovery
strategies are documented. Data is made available to employees,
and knowledge can be shared across business units and plants.

e An enterprise impact analysis is created to identify plant
interrelationships, and the resultant financial impact of each
plant. Financial impact is also determined for individual vehicle or
component product lines within each plant.

e Key operational risks and mitigation initiatives may then be
associated to any facet of the production system until resolved.

e ABusiness Continuity Plan is developed to summarize information
required for business recovery. A flexible approach allows each
plant to develop a situation-specific response. Elements of the
plan are tested annually, at a minimum, through a simulation
exercise.

The results and priorities of the Business Continuity Management
process are reviewed regularly by management.

By the end of 2018, Business Continuity Plans had been developed
for 21 of the higher-risk manufacturing plants in the United States,
Canada and Mexico, accounting for approximately 80% of FCA’s
total NAFTA revenue attributed to vehicle sales. Plans have also
been developed for a core set of supporting corporate functions in
the U.S., Canada and Mexico that most directly impact operations.

Disaster Recovery Management is complementary to business
continuity management as it entails strategies and processes to plan
for, respond to, and recover from significant business disruptions
impacting Information and Communications Technologies (ICT).
Many business functions are extremely time sensitive and cannot
be interrupted for an extended period of time. Accordingly, disaster
recovery’s goals include minimizing downtime and restoring
business operations, and supporting applications within acceptable
time frames.

The Disaster Recovery Team oversees program administration,
governance, and compliance. The Chief Information Security Officer
is responsible for ensuring that the Disaster Recovery program is
executed within ICT.

Disaster Recovery enables FCA to:

e help ensure the safety and well-being of personnel, customers,
and other individuals conducting business at FCA

e minimize the loss of data, revenue, and customers in the event
of a disaster

e meet our contractual and legal obligations.

Because disruptions to business operations may also impact
non-manufacturing activities, FCA Services has also put Business
Continuity Plans (BCP) in place in its operations. FCA Services is
the shared service center dedicated to supporting FCA’s worldwide
processes and activities within Finance, Taxation, HR Services
and Customs. The FCA Services Business Continuity Plan follows
the best practices and requirements of international standards
(FCA Services is ISO 27001 certified) and focuses on the safety of
employees and on continuity of services.

This Plan includes:

e Policies and Procedures followed by all FCA Services countries

e Enterprise Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis
to identify the risks and evaluate financial, reputational and
operational impact. To mitigate the risks, action plans and new
countermeasures are implemented.

e Key Performance Indicators to assess the correct alignment of all
parties with the BCP requirements and the full achievement of all
objectives

e Business Continuity Plans with all steps and actions to be taken
in case of a disruption

e disruption scenarios to be prepared addressing adverse situations

© consistent control and monitoring of events that could impact the
business

e testing, from simulation exercises to full testing, to ensure the
validity of the plan and involve and train employees

e Business Continuity Plan enhancements as a result of testing
performed.

All FCA Services Business Continuity activities are reviewed every
year by a Steering Committee as well as by internal and independent
external auditors to assure the correctness and consistent
improvement of the Business Continuity Plan.
