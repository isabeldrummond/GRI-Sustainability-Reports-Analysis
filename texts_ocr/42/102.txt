LOGISTICS OPERATIONS

Key elements of successful logistics operations
include reducing stock and material handling, and
delivering only what is needed, where it is needed,
at the right time. At FCA, we work together with
our suppliers and logistics partners to improve
processes by re-engineering material flows and
packaging, and applying just-in-time methodology.

FCA Global Purchasing and Supply Chain serves as the link between
Group plants, the supplier network and dealers by managing
transports among these parties. The logistics operations are
handled by a variety of internal and external operators, depending on
the origin and destination of the goods. The Company has adopted
Logistics Guidelines that provide direction on how to optimize
transport fleet characteristics and apply methodologies to reduce
the impact of freight and vehicle movement.

The Company's logistics approach focuses on:

e the optimization of logistics flows and the adoption of low-
emission transport vehicles to improve performance and minimize
impacts on the environment

e the implementation of emerging solutions and technologies to
protect parts and decrease the use of packaging and protective
materials to save resources.

We monitor our logistics performance to identify areas of
improvement and actions needed, and transparently communicate
our related environmental and social impacts to stakeholders.

 

LOW-EMISSION TRANSPORT

The use of low-emission trucks for transport contributes to reducing
FCA‘s environmental impact. Where possible, the Group transport
fleets are adopting alternative fuel solutions to improve performance.

The Group’s own transport fleet - FCA Transport in the U.S. and
Canada, and i-FAST Automotive Logistics in Europe - includes trucks
that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas
(LNG) for the delivery of finished vehicles. This fleet of nearly 200
trucks achieved a reduction of approximately 3,500 tons of CO,
emissions in 2018.

Other FCA affiliations that foster eco-friendly logistics include our
partnership with SmartWay, a collaboration between the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and the freight industry. The
partnership has expanded to Canada and is designed to help
companies reduce the carbon footprint of their transport operations.
In Mexico, carriers participate in a similar program called Transporte
Limpio (Clean Transportation).

TRANSPORT OPTIMIZATION

Optimizing transport networks, modes and capacity improves
efficiencies in the supply chain. By tailoring leading global practices
and initiatives and limiting the travel required to move finished
vehicles and parts, FCA's logistics operations supply our plants and
dealerships effectively and efficiently.

Network optimization focuses on the route design from origin to
destination and minimizing the distance and cost. Efforts such
as removing intermediate storage locations and considering the
locations of potential suppliers are among the actions taken.
One example in 2018 involved reducing the distance parts were
shipped internationally by optimizing consolidation centers. This
change avoided more than 1.3 million km and approximately
1,500 tons of CO,.

Mode optimization concentrates on the type of transportation such
as road, rail and ocean. The Group explores alternative solutions
for both parts and vehicle distribution, especially for long distance
shipments. For example, we optimized the transport mode from
truck and rail to sea for finished vehicles destined to U.S. dealers
from Mexico, avoiding more than 3,600 tons of CO, in 2018.

Efforts continued in 2018 to implement new, or extend existing,
intermodal solutions which combine different modes of
transportation. Initiatives where sea transportation for vehicle
distribution replaced rail transport in Europe led to savings from both
the economic and environmental perspectives. Approximately 270
tons of CO, emissions were avoided in 2018.

Capacity optimization centers on maximizing the use of available
space while considering equipment capacity and routes. For finished
vehicles, a smart-loading method is used to increase the number of
units on rail cars by combining vehicles of various dimensions to fully
utilize rail capacity. This process of optimizing the loads reduces the
number of rail cars necessary, increasing efficiency and reducing
costs as well as carbon emissions.
