RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

FCA’s global research and development activities
are aimed at improving the design, performance,
safety, fuel efficiency, reliability, consumer
perception and sustainability of the Group’s
products and services.

During our 2018 sustainability-focused stakeholder engagements,
FCA stakeholders reconfirmed research and innovation as one of the
key material topics for the Group.

In 2018, the Group invested approximately €3.5 billion in research
and development, representing around 3.2% of net revenues from
industrial operations. Approximately 18,000 employees at 46 locations
worldwide were involved in the Group’s innovation activities, continuing
to generate a significant intellectual property portfolio. At year-end
2018, FCA had 5,726 patents and patent applications, and 1,941
protected product designs. Patent applications are filed in Europe, the
U.S. and around the world to protect technology and improvements
considered important to our business.

Important areas of focus for the Group’s research and development
activities and business plan include:

e continuing to collaborate and partner with technology and
auto industry leaders - these initiatives provide the opportunity
to leverage each other's capabilities and achieve the synergies
and economies of scale needed to advance the development of
autonomous driving technologies

© continuing to invest in a suite of technical solutions to keep pace
with evolving regulatory requirements in each region while, at the
same time, enhancing the specific strengths of our brands

© expecting to offer more than 30 vehicle nameplates with electrified
solutions.

The global innovation and product development activities are
centrally coordinated by the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). In
particular, the CTO leads FCA Research and Development (R&D)
and is responsible for stimulating opportunities for synergies and
technology transfer across the entire enterprise.

The primary FCA R&D facilities are located in Turin and Modena (Italy),
Auburn Hills (U.S.) and Windsor (Canada). In 2018, a new facility was
dedicated at FCA’s Chelsea Proving Grounds (U.S.) to further develop
and test autonomous vehicle and advanced safety technologies. The
facility was built for testing various levels of autonomy and enables
the Company to evaluate FCA vehicles using test protocols from third
parties, such as the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS),
U.S. New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) and European New Car
Assessment Program (EuroNCAP), plus additional electronic brake
test simulations.

INNOVATION AND COLLABORATION

FCA fosters innovation by encouraging creativity among our
workforce, as well as through collaboration with suppliers and
external organizations such as universities, research centers and other
institutions. Inviting, including and empowering diverse viewpoints can
promote more effective collaborations, innovation and better decision
making.

Product and process improvements may also result from suggestions
and ideas from other FCA areas, in addition to Engineering. In 2018,
the global World Class Manufacturing program that promotes
employee suggestions to improve processes produced 2.4 million
suggestions. The most actionable suggestions were implemented
and the project owners were recognized for their contributions.

Among other methods, FCA stimulates innovation internally through
training and workshops at our Innovation Spaces located around
the world. The Innovation Teams support employees with idea
generation, problem solving, process optimization, and strategy
and vision development. Creative and unique approaches are
used to unlock alternative thinking and generate new solutions.
One interesting technique explored is biomimicry, an approach to
innovation that seeks solutions to human challenges by emulating
nature’s designs and processes.

Collaborative Research

The Group engages in long-standing collaborations with universities,
research centers and other industrial players, through research
groups and joint projects. These close ties are instrumental in
encouraging creative thinking, rewarding talent and leveraging
synergies. Collaboration is promoted in many different ways by the
individual FCA companies and across the Group.

FCA\‘s collaboration with Politecnico of Turin (Italy) and the University
of Windsor (Canada) through the International Dual Master’s Degree
(IDMD) Program demonstrates our commitment to global research
and internationalization. Additionally, FCA completed the Leadership
in Automotive Powertrain (LEAP 1) project with McMaster University
(Canada) to develop next-generation, energy-efficient, high-
performance, cost effective electrified powertrain components
and control systems suitable for a range of vehicle applications.
This collaboration has been renewed for three years as the “Car of
the Future” project, and has contributed substantially to technical
advancements, but just as importantly, to the expansion of existing
FCA employee competency and to new employees engaged in the
field of hybrid and electric vehicle technologies.
