As part of our initiative to internally identify and mitigate any related
risks, the following tools have been developed:

1. an annual survey aimed at detecting any case of child and forced
labor at worldwide FCA companies, including those located in
countries that have not ratified ILO Conventions on these issues.
In 2018, no incidents of child labor or forced and compulsory
labor were reported in any of the companies mapped.

2. a Human Rights self-assessment performed by the Internal Audit
department as part of the standard internal audit process, in order
to cover due diligence requirements of the UN Ruggie Framework
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Checks are also
performed in those countries with a high risk based on the yearly
Audit Plan.

Areas covered by the self-assessment include:

© Child labor and young workers
¢ Forced labor

e Freedom from discrimination

© Conditions of employment

e Security

e Supply Chain Management

In 2018, the human rights self-assessment compliance checklist
was performed by individual legal entities and reviewed by Internal
Audit and Compliance, with a coverage of 74% of the FCA workforce
worldwide, involving the following countries: Argentina, Brazil,
Canada, China, Italy, India, Mexico and the U.S.

Alleged human rights violations are reported through the same
channels as other types of potential violations, including the FCA
Ethics Helpline and the telephone contact list available on our
corporate website.

Data Privacy Rights

In the conduct of our business operations, FCA collects a significant
amount of personally identifiable information related to employees,
contractors, suppliers, customers and any other persons with
whom we have a relationship. FCA considers the personal rights
and privacy of each and every individual to be fundamental in
our business relationships and intends to protect values such as
confidentiality and personal data protection rights.

FCA aims to operate in accordance with the laws and regulations
around the world that govern the collection and processing of
personal data. Our Code of Conduct and Data Privacy Guidelines,
available on our Company website, provide guidance on the
management of personal and sensitive data, and the prevention of
potential privacy and security risks and incidents.

Environmental Protection

FCA is conscious of the effect that our activities and products have on
society and the environment, and of our role in developing solutions
to reduce our environmental footprint. We foster environmental
protection in our overall approach to business and have established
Environmental Guidelines, publicly available on our website, to
promote and instill these efforts as applied to our products and our
operations.

We evaluate the impact of our vehicles on the environment throughout
their entire life cycle. Our approach to responsible vehicle development
includes dedication to efficient powertrains, improved aerodynamics,
weight reduction, safety, quality, increased use of renewable materials,
and alternative mobility solutions. We believe that immediate and
tangible results can best be achieved by combining conventional and
alternative technologies, while recognizing and accommodating the
different economic, geographic and fuel requirements of each market.

In our industrial operations, FCA has adopted World Class
Manufacturing (WCM), a structured production system that promotes
sustainable, systematic improvements aimed to evaluate and address
all types of wastes and losses (including injuries) at our manufacturing
operations by applying methods and standards with rigor, and with
the involvement of the entire manufacturing workforce.

Responsibility for protecting the environment rests with everyone at
FCA, as well as with our business partners and the customers who
drive our vehicles. We encourage the safe and eco-friendly use of our
products, providing customers and dealers with information regarding
the use, maintenance and dismantling of vehicles and other products.
We expect our non-managed operations such as suppliers, dealers,
contractors, business partners, licensees, and joint venture partners
to comply with all environmental-related regulations and to contribute
to an overall improvement in environmental impact throughout the
value chain. We encourage our employees to take an active part in
our efforts to protect the environment, and provide a wide range of
engagement opportunities, communications and training activities to
support this objective.

FCA acknowledges the challenges posed by climate change and as
a result, has set targets that contribute to the goal of transitioning to
a low-carbon future.

To reduce the impact of our vehicles, we strive to reduce CO,
emissions and improve fuel economy in response to the unique
regulatory requirements of FCA’s major markets.

In the European Union (EU), FCA has set a target to achieve a 40%
reduction in CO, emissions by 2020 compared with the baseline of
2006 for mass-market cars sold in Europe.
