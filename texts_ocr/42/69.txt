Included in FCA's electrification roll-out is the Jeep Renegade Plug-in
Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) that has been scheduled for market
launch in early 2020. The Jeep Renegade PHEV will be produced at
the Melfi plant (Italy). Leveraging the already installed vehicle platform
and PHEV elements that underpin Jeep Renegade, the European
Jeep Compass also will be produced at the Melfi plant. Both
vehicles were presented at the 2019 Geneva International Motor
Show. Applying the same flexible platform and PHEV technology,
activities will also commence to prepare the Pomigliano plant (Italy)
to produce an Alfa Romeo Compact Utility Vehicle (CUV). A Fiat
Panda Mild Hybrid Vehicle (MHV) will also be launched in Pomigliano.
FCA also announced the installation of a full Battery Electric Vehicle
(BEV) platform applied on the new Fiat 500, capable of scaling
to other applications worldwide. The new Fiat 500 BEV will be
manufactured at the FCA Mirafiori plant (Italy).

In February 2019, FCA announced plans to invest a total of $4.5
billion in five of our existing U.S. plants, and to work on building
a new assembly plant in the city of Detroit. This action would
increase capacity to meet growing demand for our Jeep and Ram
brands, including production of two new Jeep-branded white space
vehicles, as well as electrified models. The proposed projects would
create nearly 6,500 new jobs.

Transmissions and Driveline

Our transmission portfolio includes manual transmissions, dual dry
clutch transmissions and automatic transmissions.

Our automatic transmission portfolio includes 8- and 9-speed
units developed in an effort to provide our customers with
improved efficiency, performance and drive comfort. Long travel
damper and pendulum damper technologies are used to allow
the engine to operate at a lower speed and higher torque. In this
area the engine is more efficient at converting the fuel energy to
mechanical energy.

Other improvements are used to reduce the power consumption
of the transmission. The second generation TorqueFlite 8-speed
improves transmission efficiency via improved line pressure
control and reduced clutch drag. The addition of transmission
oil heaters allows for the transmission to quickly warm up to
operating temperatures and improve transmission efficiency. FCA
is investigating many other technologies to increase transmission
system efficiency such as selectable one-way clutches and reduced
oil viscosity.

In support of global fuel consumption and CO, requirements, FCA has
developed our first dedicated hybrid transmission, the eFlite, used
in the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid. The new eFlite hybrid transmission
architecture is an electrically variable front wheel drive transaxle with

70

a split input configuration and incorporates two electric motors, both
capable of driving in full electric mode. The lubrication and cooling
system makes use of two pumps, one electrically operated and one
mechanically driven. The FCA team expects future hybrid vehicle
portfolio growth with the eFlite transmission and similar electrified
propulsion systems.

ALTERNATIVE FUELS

FCA’s vehicle emission reduction strategy includes the use of
alternative fuels, from natural gas to biofuels, offering technologies
that are aligned with the fuels available in various markets, and
capable of reducing emission levels.

Natural Gas

FCA is among the EU-market leaders in compressed natural gas
(CNG) propulsion. Since 1997, the Group has sold approximately
760,000 natural gas-powered cars and commercial vehicles.
Natural gas is one of the most economical fuels available and
a viable alternative to traditional fuels. It produces a low level of
regulated emissions and studies have shown it generates 23% less
CO, emissions compared with gasoline. In addition, natural gas
has the potential to become a renewable fuel source in the form of
biomethane.

Biomethane: a Renewable Fuel Source

Biomethane, which is produced by upgrading biogas, has the
same properties and uses as fossil natural gas. Biogas is derived
from organic materials such as manure, crop residues and organic
municipal waste. A natural gas vehicle can also run on biomethane
and, on a well-to-wheel basis, produces roughly the same level of
CO, emissions as an electric-powered vehicle running on electricity
generated from renewable fuel.

FCA is engaged in several projects to promote biomethane as a
sustainable solution for transportation. Among these initiatives,
a Fiat Panda Natural Power vehicle was delivered in 2017 to the
CAP Group, the utility company that manages water works, sewage
and treatment facilities in metropolitan Milan (Italy). Since then, the
Fiat Panda Natural Power has recorded thousands of kilometers
fueled by the biomethane made by the CAP Group from sewage
sludge and waste water. In 2018, the project was included within the
“Zerosprechi” campaign and presented to the Italian Parliament as a
circular economy best practice.
