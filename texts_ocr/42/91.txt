Other Emissions

Estimated emissions of other substances, based on direct fuel
consumption for energy production, slightly increased in 2018.
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions increased as a result of higher
natural gas consumption, while Sulfur Oxides (SOx) emissions
increased as a result of the increased production at our foundries.
Dust also increased slightly.

WATER MANAGEMENT

FCA aims to responsibly manage our entire water cycle, starting
from water withdrawal from municipal water suppliers or natural
sources; through use and reuse of recycled water for cooling,
cleaning and sanitation; and the discharge in public sewer systems
or surface water bodies, which occurs after passing through a
wastewater treatment process.

FCA has focused particularly on the adoption of technologies and
procedures to increase recycling and reuse of water and decrease
the level of pollutants in discharged water. We periodically map
the availability of water resources around the world, correlating
the quantity of water available with the quantity consumed in
each region. The Group adopted a new risk assessment method
in 2016 to evaluate water stressed areas. We conduct scenario
analyses to identify those plants located in areas where water is
considered a limited resource.

As a result of improvements in water cycle management and
measures taken to reuse water in industrial processes, FCA reduced
2018 water withdrawal by 29% compared with 2010 (from 30.6 to
21.7 million m%). Projects to cut the quantity of water withdrawn led
to an overall savings of about €2.5 million in 2018. A 99% recycling
water index resulted in 2.3 billion m® of water saved.

In 2018, water withdrawal per vehicle produced at mass-market
vehicle assembly and stamping plants was approximately 38%
lower than 2010.

In addition to minimum standards of legal requirements, FCA
regularly measures and analyzes the quality of wastewater to
provide a comprehensive view of FCA’s overall impact on water
quality to maintain levels well below legal limits. Of 106 total plants
(including four joint ventures) active in 2018, all were serviced by
either an internal or external wastewater treatment system. No
significant spills were reported.

The recycling index is calculated on the basis of total water requirement, which is the sum of
water withdrawn and water recirculated in the plants.
