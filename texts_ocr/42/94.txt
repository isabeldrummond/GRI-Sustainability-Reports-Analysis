SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT

The selection of suppliers with proven capabilities
in quality management, market understanding, and
readiness to innovate is critical in distinguishing
our products from those of the competition.
By working with our suppliers to create responsible
procurement practices, we can limit exposure to
unexpected events and supply disruption, while
building long-term core competence that can drive
sustainable growth over time.

FCA Purchasing, the organization responsible for supplier
management, sets global purchasing strategies and oversees the
integration of processes worldwide. This organization also works
with automotive peers and non-automotive counterparts to integrate
key environmental, social, and governance considerations into
global purchasing decisions. Our buying teams work with suppliers
and colleagues from many internal functional areas to develop and
execute sourcing strategies as well as support the ongoing selection,
management and development of our supply base.

FCA\s supplier relationships are driven by our Foundational Principles
that provide the framework we use internally and in working with our
suppliers. Focused training events take place across FCA's regions
to promote awareness and observance of these Principles, and it is
our goal that they be reflected in all supplier relationships:

1. Integrity - Trust and be trustworthy

2. Mutual Transparency - Share expectations and information

3. Proactive Collaboration - Work together effectively and efficiently

4. Personal Accountability - Take ownership and accept responsibility

5. Empathy & Advocacy - Respect and support each other

6. Sense of Urgency - Act quickly and decisively

7.Continuous Improvement - Share best practices

8.Long-Term Mindset - Make decisions that foster sustainable
relationships.

Our suppliers include both direct material suppliers that produce
the parts and components that make up our vehicles, as well as
indirect suppliers, who provide the goods and services needed to
run our operations. We have a global network of more than 2,400
suppliers, ranging in size from small operations with few employees
up to very large companies, which supply us with everything
from basic materials to state-of-the-art componentry. Our supply
base is concentrated, with 150 strategic suppliers accounting
for approximately 60% of direct material purchases by value.
The Group classifies suppliers as being strategic through a formal
process based on the following criteria: allocated spending amount;
production and spare parts capacity; technical and commercially-
viable alternatives; and the value of Group procurement orders as a
percentage of the supplier's annual turnover.

FCA‘s operations impact local economies and, whenever possible,
we utilize local suppliers near major locations of operation. This
generates direct and indirect income and employment opportunities
in the communities where the business is located, in both developed
and emerging economies, while minimizing transport-related
environmental impacts. Local suppliers are those with manufacturing
operations that supply an FCA plant located in the same country.
For example, in recent years more than 75% of our spending at our
plants in Brazil has originated from in-country suppliers.

SUPPLIER TRAINING
AND COLLABORATION

FCA’s communication with our suppliers is based on the trust and
transparency outlined in our Purchasing Foundational Principles.
Through a variety of channels, we strive to promote innovation,
quality products, efficiency, best practice sharing and sustainability
concepts. We engage with our suppliers through, among other
methods, Technology Days, industry and supply chain organizations
and events, extensive training, and one-on-one dialogue.

 

Technology Days
with suppliers

In 2018, FCA and our suppliers participated in 74 Technology Day
events. These events encourage collaboration with suppliers on
innovative solutions for features, efficiencies and quality, and allow
suppliers to share some of their latest technological developments
and concepts for the future.

Supporting our efforts to engage sub-tier suppliers, FCA also
hosts Technology Open House events which allow Tier 2 or Tier
3 suppliers to present commodities, technologies or services to
specifically-defined FCA audiences they might not otherwise reach.
In 2018, 24 Technology Open House events were held.
