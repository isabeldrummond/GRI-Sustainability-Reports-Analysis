WASTE MANAGEMENT

To reduce the consumption of raw materials and related environmental
impacts, FCA has implemented procedures to pursue optimal recovery
and reuse with minimal waste. We strive to recycle what cannot be
reused. If neither reuse nor recovery is possible, waste is disposed of
using the method available that has the least environmental impact
(waste-to-energy conversion or treatment) with landfills used only as a
last resort. In 2018, 63 FCA plants sent zero waste to landfills.

As a result of continued improvements in waste management, FCA
achieved a 4% reduction of waste generated in 2018 compared
with 2017. In 2018, these efforts saved about €4 million. In addition,
revenues of about €72 million were generated by selling recoverable
waste to companies that use it to generate new products or energy.

Further, the Group carefully manages the amount of hazardous waste it
generates - in accordance with applicable regulations in each jurisdiction
- and places particular importance on reducing the generation of such
waste, since by its very nature it is often less suitable for recovery.

Through appropriate environmental practices, total hazardous waste

decreased by 51% compared with 2010 baseline levels.

Total waste generated 875,170 914,891 1,317,015

In mass-market vehicle assembly and stamping plants, the quantity
of waste generated per vehicle produced in 2018 decreased by 8%
compared with the prior year (from 90.8 to 83.3 kg/vehicle produced),
and by 62% compared with 2010 (from 217.2 to 83.3 kg/vehicle
produced). The significant decrease from 2016 to 2017 was the result of
waste reduction initiatives and the alignment in NAFTA to country-specific
waste exemptions. Hazardous waste per vehicle produced decreased
62% compared with 2010 (from 8.2 to 3.1 kg/vehicle produced).

In 2018, the waste recovery rate in mass-market vehicle assembly
and stamping plants was around 96% and the percentage of waste
sent to landfill was around 3%.
