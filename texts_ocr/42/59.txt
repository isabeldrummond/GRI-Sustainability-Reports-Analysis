ADVANCING EDUCATION

A significant portion of FCA’s community engagement is focused
on education and helping develop the workforce of tomorrow.
We partner with academic and nonprofit organizations across the
globe to promote educational opportunities, and subsequently,
employability. These partnerships include programs to mentor youth,
encourage them to remain in school, and help them develop the life
and technical skills necessary to succeed. Many of our initiatives
aim to expand science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)
skills and opportunities, as the demand for skilled professionals is
expected to continue to grow across the automotive industry.

e.DO Experience for Young Generations

In 2018, FCA’s production systems brand, Comau, launched a
program of innovative training courses in Italy centered on digital
transformation and robotics. More than 5,000 students had the
opportunity to participate in the “Robotic Experience” project, which
is offered from elementary to high school. The courses range from
basic digital literacy to advanced programming certifications, and
include training for teachers. e.DO, a modular robot that Comau
created for the program, engages and entertains students while
teaching basic coding, robotics and STEM skills. The training
can lead to completion of the Patentino della Robotica (Robotics
License), which is recognized by the Italian Ministry of Education
as work-related learning that can be used as certification for future
employment.

Based on the success of this program in Italy, Comau launched a
similar robotics training project in China, in cooperation with the
Xingiao Vocational and Technical School. In 2018, more than 100
teachers and students participated, and the initiative received
recognition from the Shanghai Songjiang Government.

FIRST Robotics

FCA and the FCA Foundation aim to engage students in STEM-
related activities at a young age through programs such as FIRST
(For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), an
international, not-for-profit organization founded to inspire young
people’s interest and participation in science and technology.

In 2018, the FCA Foundation awarded approximately €470,000
in grants to FIRST programs in the U.S. and Canada. More than
90 FCA employees served as team mentors to guide 120 student
teams at the grade school, high school and middle school levels
to design, build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks
against a field of competitors. Through this process, students learn
basic physics, electrical and mechanical engineering, and machining
skills, as well as teamwork and collaboration.

The FIRST Robotics Championship was held in Detroit in 2018, with
the FCA Foundation serving as the Volunteer Sponsor for the event.
Approximately 700 robotics teams from 37 countries participated.
Teams supported by FCA mentors earned top honors, including
the highest honor given at the competition, the Chairman’s Award,
which recognizes the team that best represents the model for other
teams to emulate. Another supported team was a member of the
four-team alliance that took first place, winning the FIRST Robotics
Competition. Other teams were recognized with the Engineering
Inspiration Award, Creativity Award, Entrepreneurship Award, and
the Innovation in Control Award.

The FCA Foundation increased its support for FIRST programs in
underserved communities, including providing funding at the middle
school level. This will help build a pipeline of young students and
inspire them to maintain interest in STEM fields throughout their
academic careers.

Alternanza Scuola-Lavoro

Alternanza Scuola-Lavoro is an initiative administered by the Italian
government that aims to familiarize high school students in Italy
with real working situations. The program offers an alternative to
traditional classroom learning through work-school programs at a
variety of companies. To support the initiative, FCA launched the
FCA for Education project in 2016. FCA for Education consists
of two initiatives: FCA Adoption and FCAe_discovery. These two
projects represented an FCA investment of approximately €142,000
in 2018 and roughly 5,850 hours volunteered by FCA employees.
