European Union

In Europe, emissions are regulated by the European Commission
(EC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
(UNECE). The EC imposes standardized emission control
requirements on vehicles sold in all 28 EU member states, while
non-EU countries apply regulations under the UNECE framework.

Euro 6 emission levels are in effect for all passenger cars and light
commercial vehicles and require additional technologies, which
further increase the cost of diesel engines compared to prior Euro 5
standards. Further requirements of Euro 6 have been developed by
the EC and became effective for all new passenger cars registered
after September 1, 2018. In addition, a new test procedure to directly
assess the regulated emissions of light duty vehicles under real driving
conditions became effective for newly homologated passenger cars in
2017 and will become effective for all new passenger cars registered
in 2019 and for new light commercial vehicles registered in 2020.

Each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific sales-weighted
fleet average target for CO, emissions as related to vehicle weight.
This legislation sets an industry fleet average target of 95 grams of
CO, per kilometer starting in 2020 for passenger cars (130g/km until
2019).

The EU has also adopted standards for regulating CO, emissions
from light commercial vehicles (LCVs). This regulation requires that
new light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average CO, target of 147
grams of CO, per kilometer in 2020 (175g/km until 2019).

In December 2018, the European Institutions agreed on new CO,
emissions targets starting from 2025 and 2030: 15% reduction
from 2021 levels in 2025 (both passenger cars and LCV) and a
37.5% reduction for passenger cars and 31% reduction for LCV in
2030 from 2021 levels.

A new regulatory test procedure for measuring CO, emissions and
fuel consumption of light duty vehicles, the World harmonized Light
vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), entered into force on September 1,
2018 for all passenger cars. The WLTP is expected to provide CO,
emissions and fuel consumption values that are more representative
of real driving conditions.

In the European Union (EU), FCA has set a target to achieve a 40%
reduction in CO, emissions by 2020 compared with the baseline of
2006 for mass-market cars sold in Europe.

In the EU, the average CO, emissions of the Group’s mass-market
cars is 125.3 g/km in 2018. This represents a 17% decrease
compared with 2006 (the benchmark year used in EU regulations
to set the 2012-2015 and 2020 targets), and a 23% reduction
compared with 2000, which was the first year the EU Commission
monitored average emissions.

The Group’s average CO, emissions in 2018 was affected mainly
by three factors that led to an increase compared to 2017:
the decrease in diesel vehicle sales in favor of gasoline vehicles;
the shift of sales to high-end segments; and the new engine
calibration and commercialization of vehicles compliant with
the new Euro 6d-TEMP standard, which includes the new Real
Driving Emissions (RDE) test to verify emissions under real driving
conditions.
