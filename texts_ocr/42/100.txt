SUPPLIER DIVERSITY

FCA’s commitment to diversity and inclusion also extends to our
supply chain. FCA believes the diversity of our suppliers should
reflect the diversity of our workforce and the communities in which
we do business. Diversity Suppliers are those that are majority-
owned by recognized minority groups or by women, and which are
certified by relevant government councils.

We work to include diversity and inclusion considerations as an
everyday practice in our dealings with our employees, our dealers,
our suppliers and our customers. With a supplier diversity and
development program that spans 35 years, FCA spent more
than €5.7 billion with Tier 1 and Tier 2 minority suppliers in 2018.
The FCA US suppliers’ External Balanced Scorecard includes a
metric for diversity sourcing at the Tier 2 level.

FCA US was named Corporation of the Year - Tier Il Program
by the National Minority Supplier Development Council for our
success in requiring our Tier | suppliers to do direct business with
diverse suppliers. The Women’s Business Enterprise National
Council recognized FCA US as one of America’s Top Corporations
supporting Women’s Business Enterprises, the only national award
honoring corporations for world-class supplier diversity programs
that reduce barriers and drive growth for women-owned businesses.

FCA was also named “Best in Class” by the Great Lakes Women’s
Business Council for Excellence in Supplier Diversity, and was
awarded Corporation of the Year by the Michigan Hispanic Chamber
of Commerce for leadership and commitment to the Hispanic
business community.

The FCA High Focus program works with suppliers with greater
potential for diverse spend and equips them with the tools and
support to achieve their diversity targets. The diversity spend status
of each supplier is monitored monthly and reviewed quarterly with
them. FCA has provided consistent support for our High Focus
suppliers, resulting in placement of more than €9.3 billion with
certified minority suppliers since the program began in 2010.

FCA supports inclusion across our supply base through the
annual Matchmaker event, which creates opportunities for diverse
suppliers. Completing its 19th year, Matchmaker provided more
than 200 minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned
businesses access to our Tier | suppliers and to decision makers
within our procurement organization. In 2018, the event included
numerous training sessions, including the FCAlnnovate! session, in
which nine minority suppliers were given five minutes to pitch their
companies’ innovative solution to FCA Purchasing representatives
and the High Focus Suppliers. The event also included the W2W
Mixer, a speed-networking event that brought together more than
100 female entrepreneurs and industry leaders to present their
businesses and ideas to FCA executives.

Training, mentorship, scholarship support, sponsorships,
membership and Board and committee participation are some of
the ways we support organizations that include the National Minority
Supplier Development Council, the Canadian Aboriginal and Minority
Supplier Council, the Women’s Business Enterprise National
Council, WBE Canada and WECONNECT International. In addition,
we support veteran-business ownership through membership with
the National Veteran-Owned Business Association and the National
Veteran Business Development Council.
