CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

FCA’s governance supports how we do business
on a daily basis, enabling us to lead the way to
sustainable growth and to create value while
respecting the legitimate interests of stakeholders.

The main elements of FCA’s governance structure are described
below, while full disclosure on this aspect is available in the Annual
Report.

The Board of Directors — composed of 12 Directors, including both
executive and non-executive — is responsible for the management
and strategic direction of the Group. The designation of Directors as
either executive or non-executive is determined by shareholders at
the time of election.

The Board of Directors as a whole is composed of two executive
Directors (i.e., the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer), having
responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Company,
and 10 non-executive Directors, who do not have such day-to-
day responsibility within the Company or the Group. The general
authority to represent the Company shall be vested in the Board of
Directors and the Chief Executive Officer.

It is the responsibility of the non-executive Directors to supervise
the policies carried out by the executive Directors and the general
affairs of the Company and its affiliated enterprise, including the
implementation of the strategy of the Company regarding long-
term value creation. With a view to maintaining supervision on the
Company, the non-executive Directors regularly discuss FCA’s
long-term business plans, the implementation of such plans and
the risks associated with such plans with the executive Directors.
We have determined that eight of our 12 Board members qualify as
independent for purposes of New York Stock Exchange rules and
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.

The Board of Directors adopted a diversity policy for the Board of
Directors (the Diversity Policy), as the Company believes that diversity
in the composition of the Board of Directors in terms of age, gender,
expertise, work background and nationality is an important means
of promoting debate, balanced decision-making and independent
actions of the Board of Directors.

The Company considers each of these diversity aspects key
drivers to support the above-mentioned goals and to achieve
sufficient diversity of views and the expertise needed for a
proper understanding of current affairs and longer-term risks and
opportunities related to the Company's business. The Board of
Directors and its Governance and Sustainability Committee consider
such factors when evaluating nominees for election to the Board of
Directors and during the annual performance assessment process.

The composition of the FCA Board of Directors reflects international
standards:

e there are 12 Directors, ensuring the effective functioning of the
Board and its Committees

e the Board is composed of three women and nine men

e Board member average age is 59

e a skill matrix of the Board members is provided on the corporate
website.

During 2018, there were nine meetings of the Board of Directors.
The average attendance at those meetings was approximately 95%.

BOARD COMMITTEES

The Board of Directors is supported by three Committees:

e Governance and Sustainability Committee
e Audit Committee
e Compensation Committee.

The Governance and Sustainability Committee is responsible for,
among other things, assisting and advising the Board of Directors
with: (i) the identification of the criteria, professional and personal
qualifications for candidates to serve as Directors; (ii) periodic
assessment of the size and composition of the Board of Directors;
(iii) periodic assessment (annually) of the performance of individual
Directors and reporting on this to the Board of Directors; (iv)
proposals for appointment of executive and non-executive Directors;
(v) supervision of the selection criteria and appointment procedure
for senior management; (vi) monitoring and evaluating reports
on the Group’s sustainable development policies and practices,
management standards, strategy, performance and governance
globally; and (vii) reviewing, assessing and making recommendations
as to strategic guidelines for sustainability-related issues, and
reviewing the annual Sustainability Report.
