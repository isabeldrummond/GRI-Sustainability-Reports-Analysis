Safety Insights

FCA has significantly reduced the frequency and severity of work-
related injuries over the past several years through the application of
tools and methodologies provided by the OHSMS and by the WCM
Safety pillar, together with the active involvement of employees,
development of specific competencies and targeted investment.

Work-related injuries are analyzed to determine the causes and to
take appropriate measures to avoid recurrence.

In 2018, the Frequency Rate index was down 22% compared to the
previous year (with 0.07 injuries per 100,000 hours worked) and the
Severity Rate was substantially unchanged compared to 2017 (with
0.03 days of absence due to injuries per 1,000 hours worked).

FCA‘s investment in health and safety, combined with the measures
adopted, have resulted in a progressive reduction in the level of
occupational risk attributed to Group plants in Italy by INAIL, the
Italian accident and disability insurance agency. As a result, the
Group was eligible for “good performer” premium discounts, which
led to savings of more than €120 million from 2012 through 2018.

Occupational illnesses refer to diseases that develop gradually over
time as a direct consequence of occupational activities carried out
by an employee. FCA regularly monitors trends in occupational
illness, and recorded approximately 360 cases worldwide in 2018.
The occupational illness frequency rate was 0.09 cases per 100,000
hours worked (compared to 0.08 in 2017). This indicator (and
changes from year to year) typically bears a low correlation to recent
or current health and safety risk prevention measures because,
unlike the injury indicators, occupational illness can relate to issues
that originated years or even decades prior to being confirmed.
Occupational illnesses are quite complex and are usually related to
risks associated with historical working methods or environmental
conditions that have long since been mitigated or eliminated.
