Quality Processes

For every FCA vehicle, quality considerations ranging from customer
expectations to functional requirements are analyzed from the
earliest stages of design. A cross-functional initiative within FCA
focuses on managing risks and implementing solutions for new
vehicles. The program assesses the risk of items, such as new
vehicle features, during the design phase, which is then evaluated
against existing data and processes to determine if different testing
or timing approaches are needed. The program helps identify and
avoid potential issues earlier in the vehicle development process and
makes implementing solutions more cost effective.

At times, differences in customer expectations or regulatory
requirements within a specific market have an impact on quality
standards. When this occurs, FCA typically applies the most
stringent specifications to all markets. These market-based
differences add complexity and make close cooperation across
regions an essential part of the process. To support global quality
collaboration, the Global Issue Management (GIM) system provides
a single repository that is available in five languages to help
expedite issue resolution across functional groups and regions.
Benefits of the GIM system extend beyond our internal resources
by providing our supply chain access to view and address supplier-
related issues. In 2018, the GIM system moved further up in the
overall vehicle process into the Product Development phase.
By making this improvement, issues are identified and tracked earlier
in one system that can be seen by team members in all regions.

Inside FCA assembly plants, we operate state-of-the-art metrology
centers - high-tech laboratories with a clean-room environment.
The metrology labs use laser scanners and a complex set of
fixtures that mimic the body shop’s process so that engineers and
technicians can assess and mitigate build parameters to evaluate
risk more proactively. All of these tools are used to find and resolve
issues before vehicles are shipped to dealers, and ultimately, to the
end customers. As part of our quality approach, all Group plants
have adopted a Quality Management System that is ISO 9001
certified, and all powertrain plants in Europe are also ISO/TS 16949
certified.

FCA conducts thousands of reliability, capability and durability tests
each year at our proving grounds in Chelsea (U.S.) and Balocco
(Italy). During 2018, a new facility was dedicated at the Chelsea
Proving Grounds to allow for testing of various levels of autonomy
and enable the Company to evaluate FCA vehicles using test
protocols from third parties, such as the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety (IIHS), U.S. New Car Assessment Program (NCAP)
and European New Car Assessment Program (EuroNCAP), plus
additional electronic brake test simulations.

Engineering and Quality teams also study how vehicles perform in
less predictable environments. Reliability test fleet vehicles are driven
day and night on public road surfaces, at high and low altitudes
and through blizzard conditions, as well as dry, desert heat and hot,
humid locations all over the globe. We conduct extreme weather
testing at a number of facilities worldwide, including in Sweden,
South Africa and the Middle East, as well as at a cold weather testing
facility in Fairbanks (U.S.).

In addition to monitoring throughout the product development
process, the Connected Customer Fleet (CCF) program allows
selected customers to participate in an online community to provide
earlier and more extensive vehicle feedback to FCA than traditional
methods. In 2018, FCA implemented a version of the program to
better understand our commercial customers and their duty cycles.
Feedback from these customers is being used to change design
standards and targets. Programs such as CCF help to rapidly
identify and resolve potential issues with new models and improve
customer satisfaction.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

FCA understands that changing customer sentiment and
expectations, along with technology, are impacting how we
interact with customers. As we aim to build loyalty among existing
customers and appeal to potential new customers, we also are
focusing on providing convenient communication channels and
positive experiences. Our dealer network is the primary face-to-
face connection with customers and FCA has worked with our
network to help them update sales and service processes that
accommodate brand values, local requirements, and different
customer needs. Several measures have been implemented over
time to improve processes, customer service standards and service
quality for the Group’s dealer network, the vast majority of which is
privately owned.

Customer experiences are monitored on a market basis through
surveys that provide insight into customer advocacy and satisfaction
with the dealer network. Results are integrated into dealer processes,
customer contact center management, and training programs. One
primary approach used by FCA is an advocacy measurement to
track customer satisfaction. This figure represents the percentage
of customers who are likely to recommend the dealer to a friend or
family member based on their sales or service experience. In the
U.S. and in the EMEA region's major markets, the sales and service
advocacy results remained stable in 2018 compared with 2017.
