Scope 3 Emissions. Real activity data related to routes, distances, frequencies and transport capacities are used in the calculation process. Emission factors are taken from international standards
or governmental agency guidelines, among which: standard EN16258, U.S. Department of Energy, Brazilian Ministry of Transport, DEFRA-U.K. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
