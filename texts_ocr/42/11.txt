MATERIALITY AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

FCA’s sustainability reporting focuses on those topics
that have been determined to be material, that is,
reflecting the organization’s significant economic,
environmental and social impacts; or substantially
influencing assessments and decisions of
stakeholders. These topics include the most important
factors that relate to, and have an impact on, FCA’s
ability to create long-term value for our stakeholders.

Our stakeholder engagement and development of materiality are
conducted in accordance with internationally recognized frameworks
and principles, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), including the

principle of stakeholder inclusiveness; the AA1000 Principles Standard;
the AA1000 Materiality Report guidelines; the AA1000 Stakeholder
Engagement Standard; and the <IR> Materiality Background Paper.

The Materiality Diagram is reviewed periodically, and was updated
for 2018 based on the results of our analysis of material topics. The
diagram represents the relative importance of issues for both internal
and external stakeholders, helping prioritize issues in our reporting
as well as set targets to address the material aspects that have been
identified.

More information on material topics, the associated management
approach and boundaries are reported in the following chapters of
this Report.
