FCA US is a member of the United States Council for Automotive
Research (USCAR), a collaborative technology organization aimed
at strengthening the technology base of the U.S. auto industry
through cooperative research and development. Participation in
USCAR provides access to more than 400 projects with national
laboratories, research centers, industry partners and universities in
conjunction with U.S. DRIVE, a partnership between USCAR, the
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and energy and utility companies.
USCAR is also involved, through collaboration with the United
States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC), with 25 active and
completed advanced battery technology programs with a total
cost-shared value of nearly €73 million. The USCAR/USABC/DOE
collaboration allows for a total of approximately €106 million of cost-
shared funding over a five-year period for the advancement of battery
technology. The emphasis of this collaboration is to accelerate the
development of automotive battery technology among industry
partners within the U.S.

AUTONOMOUS DRIVING

FCA's 2018-2022 business plan, presented in June 2018, describes
the challenges and opportunities presented by the advances in
autonomous vehicle technology. We are devoting resources to
research and develop an approach to address changing consumer
expectations driven by growing demand for safety, convenience,
mobility-as-a-service, connectivity and quality time. Autonomous
technology demonstrates the ability of vehicle systems to take over
an increasing number of tasks which are currently performed by
the driver.

Our plan involves pursuing a multi-partner strategy for developing
advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies,
working with leaders in their respective industries.
