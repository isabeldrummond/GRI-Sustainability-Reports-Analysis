Supply Chain Risk

FCA strives to implement strategies that manage both everyday
and exceptional risks along the supply chain, while better identifying
suppliers throughout its many tiers. It is critical to understand supplier
profiles at lower tier levels to ensure a complete risk assessment
and response in the event of potential supply disruptions. Working
to develop tools that support supply chain mapping has become
an important focus. These data tools can provide FCA with an
advantage of speed-to-resolution and prioritize FCA with resources
over competitors.

Suppliers who are identified under certain risk criteria are encouraged
to work with FCA to ensure that risk management processes in place
are able to secure the flow of key components.

To accommodate supplier size and organizational structure, we have
adopted varied risk assessment techniques. Large, global suppliers
with well-structured risk management organizations are analyzed
with deductive methodologies that measure their risk management
and business continuity processes and procedures. Smaller suppliers
are visited by a specialized loss prevention team that determines their
alignment with international loss prevention standards adopted by FCA
and, where needed, recommend risk reduction action plans.

The process, led by Fiat Chrysler Risk Management and FCA
Purchasing, begins with a simplified, semi-quantitative approach:
already available information (financial, business, industrial and
geopolitical) is used to prioritize suppliers. This helps focus
engineering resources on those crucial suppliers with the greatest
potential impact or loss likelihood to FCA supply chains. A second
step entails a methodology and supporting tool that allows FCA
to assign a risk management maturity index to the supplier risk
management processes. It is based on suppliers with mature risk
management practices managing their risks and minimizing the
probability of an extended production stoppage in one of their key
manufacturing plants. The final step is to work with specialized third-
party risk engineering advisors to conduct focused loss prevention
audits of targeted suppliers to identify and quantify risks that could
impact the supply of components to FCA and develop adequate
action plans to mitigate those risks.

The methodology and reporting tools enable focused loss prevention
supplier audits to be conducted and required information to be
collected to:

e quantify the potential exposure to FCA

e define the fire and natural hazard loss scenarios and quantify the
production downtime

estimate the time to restart and time to resource

e identify potential equipment bottlenecks, critical equipment and
vital Tier 2 or 3 suppliers.

By the end of 2018, this methodology was applied to 52 suppliers
identified as critical by the Purchasing team.

Cyber Risk Management

Fiat Chrysler Risk Management has created varied work groups,
made up of multidisciplinary specialists from FCA internal functions
and departments as well as from insurance companies for
developing advanced and innovative risk engineering approaches
and solutions.

Specialized teams composed of FCA cyber risk experts and
insurance market leaders, and coordinated by the Fiat Chrysler Risk
Management loss prevention team, analyze globally the ICT macro
processes to verify alignment with industry best practices. Where
necessary, they recommend focused improvements that further
enhance their resilience. The risk management function ensures that
this initiative is consistent with other risk management processes in
place.

FCAâ€˜s dedicated cyber risk insurance coverage is designed on the
basis of a comprehensive and thorough analysis of:

e the threats of exposure of vital company assets, including the
information that must be protected and at which level

policies and procedures in place to reduce the risk of attack in the
event of a security breach

e plans and procedures in place to neutralize threats and remedy
security issues.
