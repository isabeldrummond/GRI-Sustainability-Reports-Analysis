Another aspect of supplier engagement focuses on fostering
innovation to improve products, processes and content, often
leading to sustainable solutions such as the use of recycled raw
materials or weight reduction. The Value Optimization SUPER
Program encourages a proactive approach with suppliers.
Economic benefits are shared when innovative manufacturing
technologies and leaner component designs are implemented.

FCA also encourages dialogue with the supply base by working
closely with many industry and supplier organizations. One such
group is the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), which the
Company helped found in 1982. AIAG is a cooperative forum
for the auto industry focused on improving business processes
and practices involving trading partners and peers throughout
the supply chain. In addition to a leadership role on the Board of
Directors with co-leadership within the Corporate Responsibility
Steering Committee, FCA employees are engaged in a number
of other AIAG teams that partner automakers with suppliers.
Many of the initiatives promoted by AIAG focus on sustainability
issues and on streamlining tools and metrics across the industry.
FCA works with AIAG to sponsor smaller companies, including sub-
tier suppliers, to take part in AIAG work groups and to work with
their larger peers on industry solutions.

Additional in-depth training on responsible working conditions
is offered to suppliers in partnership with AIAG. This web-based
training is developed and updated collaboratively with other
automakers and is designed to help protect the rights and dignity
of the workers who make vehicle components. The training
helps to educate and create awareness among the procurement
professionals who make sourcing decisions. It is provided at
no cost to suppliers who take the training, which is available in
eight languages and which is also provided to FCA Purchasing
employees.

FCA periodically hosts Supplier Training Weeks during the
year in Turin (Italy), Auburn Hills (U.S.) and Shanghai (China).
The curriculum covers subjects related to purchasing, quality, supply
chain management, manufacturing, finance, and engineering. The
agenda also includes dedicated classes on sustainability-related
topics such as responsible working conditions, environmental
impacts and ethics. In 2018, more than 5,950 supplier attendees
took part in Supplier Training Weeks and other events. In addition,
we launched Virtual Classroom Offering, in which suppliers take
part in a live, interactive setting from their desktop, avoiding the
expense and extra time of traveling to a training site.

Within FCA’s eSupplierConnect portal, the supplier Learning Center
provides learning opportunities and other resources for suppliers,
including content and presentations for Supplier Training Week.
As the supply base continues to expand globally, it is necessary to
effectively manage training information to enable the development,
delivery and use of this material.

Supplier WCM

FCA Purchasing, with the support of the World Class
Manufacturing Academy and FCA plant WCM specialists, has
continued providing WCM methodology and tools to our suppliers.
WCM support includes plant shop floor assessments for new
launch suppliers and focused improvement activities for those
supporting current production. To maximize the effectiveness of
the program, suppliers and commodities are prioritized based
on their impact on FCA plants, purchasing strategy, and the
supplier's current performance. Particular emphasis is placed on
supplier plants involved in upcoming product launches.

The increasingly global approach to expanding the World Class
Supplier program offers a range of engagements from basic to
advanced WCM support levels for our suppliers. FCA Purchasing
implemented a program in 2018 designed to improve suppliers’
shop floor management and to apply WCM continuous improvement
tools in their facilities. Dedicated trainers from FCA plants provided
weekly guidance and mentoring to improve a supplier's key activity
and performance indicators.

Supplier Awards

In 2018, FCA again honored outstanding suppliers from around the
world during our annual Supplier Award ceremonies. Suppliers were
recognized for their extraordinary commitment to innovation, quality,
continuous improvement and the FCA Purchasing organization’s
Foundational Principles.

A distinct category recognizes companies for their commitment
to sustainability. Suppliers meeting eligibility requirements may
nominate their companies for the award by demonstrating
excellence, innovation and the scope of their sustainability efforts in
environmental, social and governance categories.
