CUSTOMER
FOCUS

 

Among the most material topics for FCA and our stakeholders
are vehicle safety and quality, which are key elements of the
overall customer experience. We also recognize that the
mobility options, support and services that customers may
need are impacted by differences within each market such
as the culture, individual preferences and driving experiences.
With this in mind, FCA focuses on creating a positive customer
experience throughout the purchasing and ownership process
through our dealer network and many communication
channels.
