COMMUNITY

Our community investment activities reflect our
efforts to promote thriving, resilient communities.
In 2018, we committed charitable resources for a
value of about €24 million,” including contributions
from the FCA Foundation.

In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals, our social contribution efforts focus most particularly on
Quality Education; Gender Equality; Decent Work and Economic
Growth; Reduced Inequality; Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure;
and Sustainable Cities and Communities.

The Group's 2018 activities focused on a variety of causes: 35%
for education-related initiatives; 56% for community development
and welfare, including health programs; 9% for emergency relief
and other efforts. Our charitable giving was primarily in the form
of monetary contributions, which made up 84%, and the value of
employee volunteerism, which represented 9%, while the remainder
consisted of in-kind donations (7%).

A portion of the Group’s charitable activities is operated through
the FCA Foundation, which is supported solely by FCA US and
governed by a Board of Trustees consisting of corporate executives.
The FCA Foundation directs its resources toward the focus areas of
youth development, education, community service, and support for
members of the U.S. military, veterans and their families.

The Fundacidén FCA performs a similar role in Mexico.

In addition to monetary contributions from the Company, FCA
encourages our employees to donate their time and skills. During
2018, FCA employees around the world volunteered more than
174,000 hours during work time in support of social projects.

WORKING ALONGSIDE
THE COMMUNITY

FCA recognizes the importance of building strong relationships with
key community stakeholders. By working together, we can best
understand where to apply our resources and make a positive impact
in our communities.

We encourage our employees to lead by example; combining our
charitable financial donations with volunteer opportunities allows us to
address unique local needs as well as foster employee engagement.
Formal policies govern employee volunteer efforts in some regions.
FCA\’s Motor Citizens program, for example, offers salaried employees
in the U.S., Canada and Mexico a variety of engagement activities.

In 2018, nearly 13,000 employees took part in more than 1,800
Motor Citizens volunteer projects during work hours. In other areas,
ad hoc volunteer activities are organized to target specific conditions
and concerns. FCA employees around the world have volunteered
through such activities as donating blood, mentoring youth, cleaning
up streams and rivers, packing and delivering food and other supplies
to those in need, assisting following a natural disaster, among
hundreds of other initiatives.

Examples of regional initiatives illustrate the breadth of FCA’s
engagement:

Revitalizing and beautifying communities,
one neighborhood at a time

Nearly 1,000 FCA Motor Citizen employee volunteers joined
the Detroit-based nonprofit Life Remodeled to help revitalize a
neighborhood in Detroit during 2018. This marked the fourth year ina
row that Motor Citizens have joined forces with Life Remodeled, which
represents the single largest deployment each year of FCA employee
volunteers from the Company's metro Detroit offices and facilities.
During this week-long Life Remodeled project, volunteers planted
trees and perennial plants, built community gardens and installed
little free libraries. Volunteers also helped designate the safest routes
to schools with artwork, upgraded several parks, installed new bus
shelters and added neighborhood signage. In addition to providing
much-needed human resources, FCA US and its charitable arm, the
FCA Foundation, donated a combined €43,600 to Life Remodeled.

In another urban community nearby, FCA employees partnered with
Dream Centers of Michigan on a three-day outdoor beautification
program to spruce up residential streets and parks. Dream
Centers of Michigan is a volunteer-driven nonprofit organization
that serves low-income urban communities through collaboration
with individuals and organizations that invest their time and talent.
Projects included cleaning-up blight, mowing lawns, painting, and
light construction projects.

Big Brothers Big Sisters: mentoring youth in need

In 2018, FCA kicked off the second year of our site-based mentoring
program with Big Brothers Big Sisters, the oldest and largest youth
mentoring organization in the U.S. FCA employees and elementary
school students meet for one-on-one mentoring sessions at our
Auburn Hills location. Employees and students are paired for the
full academic year, participating in fun and challenging goal-setting
activities. Through a grant from the FCA Foundation and the
engagement of employee volunteers, we help provide youth facing
adversity with strong, enduring, professionally supported one-to-one
relationships.
