> 06_SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION_DEFINITIONS, METHODOLOGY AND SCOPE

In some cases, entities that are not consolidated in the financial
statements were included in the scope of reporting because of their
significant environmental and social impacts. In particular:

e Data on occupational health and safety relates to 96 of the 102
plants® (covering approximately 99% of plant workers), to office
facilities (in total covering approximately 100% of Group employees),
and to four plants of companies that are not fully consolidated,
including one joint venture in Turkey and three in China.

e Data on manufacturing environmental and energy performance
refers to 96 of the 102 plants® (covering nearly 100% of the
Group's industrial revenues), and to four plants of companies
that are not fully consolidated, including one joint venture in
Turkey and three in China.

Data reported as a measure of FCA’s impact on the environment
consists of both absolute values, directly correlated to production
volumes and reporting boundaries, and normalized values.
Normalized environmental performance indicators are presented in
order to ensure data comparability from year to year and enable
operational trends to be evaluated. Due to the significant variation in
types of production lines (vehicles, engines, etc.), it is not possible
to present normalized data at the Group level. Normalized data
presented in the “Production” section for energy, air emissions,
water and waste refers to the mass-market vehicle assembly and
stamping facilities, which account for more than half of the Group’s
environmental footprint.

The year 2010 is used as the baseline to measure progress to FCA’s
environmental targets because 2010 was the first year FCA US was
included in the scope of the Group.

Data was collected and reported with the aid of existing management
control and information systems, where available, in order to
ensure reliability of information flows and the correct monitoring
of sustainability performance. A dedicated reporting process was
established for certain indicators, using electronic databases or files
populated directly by the individuals or entities responsible for each
aspect worldwide.

Unless otherwise indicated, all data presented in the Report refers
to the International System of Units and may be subject to rounding.
In some cases, rounding of a very low number may result in a report
of zero.
