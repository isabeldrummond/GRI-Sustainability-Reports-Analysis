VEHICLE SAFETY

Delivering safe products to our customers is a fundamental
and unwavering objective of FCA, and is among the essential
responsibilities described in our Code of Conduct. In 2018, FCA
expanded our communication and enhanced the existing FCA
Ethics Helpline system worldwide to encourage suppliers, dealers
and other stakeholders to report concerns related to vehicle safety,
emissions or regulatory compliance. FCA employees are required
under our Code of Conduct to report such issues.

FCA believes that the automotive industry should adopt a systematic
approach to ensure that vehicle safety remains a fundamental
corporate value that protects drivers, passengers, the environment,
and our communities, in a socially responsible and sustainable
manner. To this end, we launched an internal Vehicle Safety
Compliance Program to apply compliance principles to various
operational functions that are dedicated to the regulatory framework
of our industry. For example, under the program, our Code of
Conduct, management communications, and publicity campaigns
are aligned to reinforce our vehicle safety culture at all levels of the
organization. Similarly, the program applies continuous improvement
methodology to ensure that potential vehicle safety risks are
identified, investigated, analyzed, and incorporated into specific
initiatives and procedures within the Vehicle Safety Regulatory
Compliance group.

Our suppliers have access to a web-based training program
that instructs them on FCA’s expectations and supplier-specific
requirements of the U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Act and regulations of
the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). This
training was launched by FCA in 2017 and incorporated feedback
from NHTSA. In 2018, collaboration began with the Automotive
Industry Action Group and other automakers to make this training
standardized and available throughout the automotive industry.

From a global perspective, the Vehicle Safety and Regulatory
Compliance organizations in the four regions where FCA operates
collectively report to the Company's Chief Technical Compliance
Officer. This alignment further supports sharing information to
harmonize guidelines and processes where possible, given the
regulatory environment.

Safety Research

Our advanced engineering organizations around the world apply
virtual reality methods and innovative technological solutions for
virtual and physical tests. By analyzing the performance of vehicle
safety systems in real-world collisions, we are able to develop future
active and passive safety systems. The engineers develop and
assess effective safety systems and concentrate on various aspects
including safety levels in front, rear and side collisions for vehicles
from different segments; protection of vulnerable road users; and
integration of active and passive safety systems. These efforts
not only strive to help improve vehicle safety but also result in the

consistent implementation of upgrades to our testing equipment and
methodology. In 2018, more than 2,400 impact and crash tests,
including full-scale crash tests, were reviewed globally to understand
performance to vehicle safety standards for vehicle occupants, as
well as pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, more than 850 real
accidents were reviewed at the Pomigliano Technical Center (Italy).

In 2018, a new facility was dedicated at FCA’s Chelsea Proving
Grounds (U.S.) for further development and testing of autonomous
vehicle and advanced safety technologies. The facility features a
dedicated autonomous highway-speed track, 35-acre safety-feature
evaluation area and a high-tech command center.

FCA also actively participates in national and international groups and
projects focused on areas of occupant and pedestrian safety such
as developing new and improved safety standards and automated
driving systems. As an example, the EMEA safety organization is a
member of IGLAD (Initiative for the Global Harmonization of Accident
Data), a consortium of auto manufacturers that collects and analyzes
traffic accident data to improve road and vehicle safety. In the U.S.,
FCA collaborates with other automakers to identify technical issues
and conduct research related to vehicle safety through the U.S.
Council for Automotive Research, among others.

Safety Technology and Ratings

FCA is responding to consumer expectations of high tech solutions
in their vehicles by devoting significant resources to research and
develop technologies that enable drivers and passengers to safely
interact with their car and with the world around them. By providing
real-time availability of services and information, FCA is contributing to
improve safety and the mobility experience. For example, Traffic Sign
Recognition uses digital camera technology and navigation-system
data to monitor the roadway for speed limits and relays the information
to the driver.

FCA offers active and passive features for diverse drivers and vehicle
segments, along with tertiary safety elements. The intent of active
safety systems is to help drivers avoid crashes by assisting them to
control their vehicles or alert them to potentially hazardous situations.
These systems monitor surroundings, the status of the vehicle, driver
behavior and include semi-automated technologies that provide
assistance to drivers in certain instances, with the driver retaining
control as needed.

Passive safety systems are designed to help mitigate the effects of
a crash. These include occupant restraint technology and the use
of more advanced materials that enable us to improve crash energy
management.

In the area of tertiary safety, the Group provides emergency rescue
sheets with information to rescue teams or first responders on special
design elements and the position of components to be considered
when assisting the occupants of vehicles involved in an accident.
