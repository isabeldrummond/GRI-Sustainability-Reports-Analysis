United States

In the U.S., vehicle fuel efficiency is measured by fuel economy
expressed in miles per gallon (mpg). An increase in fuel economy
corresponds to an increase in vehicle efficiency, and a corresponding
reduction of fuel consumption and CO, emissions. Several
regulatory agencies, including the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), and the California Air Resource Board (CARB) monitor vehicle
fuel economy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

EPA and NHTSA have issued two joint final rules governing GHG
and fuel economy, respectively, for light-duty vehicles, covering
model years 2012 through 2025. The rules provide for year-over-
year increases in each automaker's average fleet-wide fuel economy,
and corresponding decreases in GHG emissions, through model
year 2025. This standard is currently undergoing a “mid term” review
and may be modified for the 2021 through 2025 model years.

FCA is committed to improving vehicle fuel efficiency and has a target
to actively pursue actions in support of the EPA/NHTSA industry
goal and described the plan for achievement of this objective in the
business plan.

FCA has also set a target to achieve at least a five to 15%
improvement in fuel economy for major renewals of FCA US vehicles
compared with replaced vehicles/models. This target has been
achieved, and in some cases surpassed, in the years since it was
established.

The all-new 2018 Jeep Wrangler, when equipped with the new 2.0-liter
turbocharged variant of the global medium engine family, achieved
an improvement in fuel economy of over 30% versus the preceding
model equipped with the 3.6-liter engine. The 2.0-liter reduces vehicle
energy demand by deploying eTorque assist mild hybrid technology.
The eTorque system captures braking energy and uses it to assist
the vehicle during launch and in other transient situations to reduce
fuel consumption in everyday driving. The all-new 2019 Ram 1500
also offers our new eTorque mild hybrid system and it contributes
toa 10% improvement in fuel economy versus the preceding model
equipped with the 3.6-liter engine.

Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) is the sales-weighted
average fuel economy that a manufacturer’s fleet must achieve.
NHTSA’s regulations set these standards independently for
domestic and imported passenger cars, as well as for light duty
trucks. FCA's truck fuel economy (including SUVs, pickup trucks
and minivans) improved 2.5% from 2017 to 2018, increasing from
27.6 to 28.3 mpg, whereas domestic and import passenger car
fuel economy decreased. Actual fleet performance is dependent
on many factors, including the vehicles and technologies FCA
offers, as well as the mix of vehicles consumers choose to buy. In
response to a continued shift in demand toward trucks and SUVs
in the U.S., FCA is implementing a significant realignment of our
manufacturing footprint and describes this in the business plan.

‘ Data reported to NHTSA is provided by model year, the year used to designate a discrete vehicle model, irrespective of the calendar year in which the vehicle was actually produced, provided that the production
period does not exceed 24 months. Fuel economy is based on the most recent NHTSA required submission, which for 2018 reflects mid-model year data. Previous year data in the table is adjusted to reflect final

EPA/NHTSA reports.

© FCA\s import passenger car fuel economy was first reported in 2014, and includes both mass-market and luxury vehicles sold in the U.S., including Fiat, Maserati, Alfa Romeo and Ferrari brand vehicles. The spin-off

of Ferrari from the Group was completed on January 8, 2016 and is included through 2016.
