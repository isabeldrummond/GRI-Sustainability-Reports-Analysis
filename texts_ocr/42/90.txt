ENERGY CONSUMPTION

The Group seeks solutions in our manufacturing processes that
enable further reductions in our energy consumption, with a
particular focus on decreasing the use of fossil fuels. Over time,
these solutions have generated significant savings in energy-
related costs. In 2018, energy consumption was higher than both
the previous year and the baseline year in absolute terms due to
increased production in the NAFTA region.

At mass-market vehicle assembly and stamping plants, the energy
consumption per vehicle produced increased by approximately 9%
compared with last year (from 5.60 to 6.09 Gu), but still recorded a
decrease of 17% compared with 2010 (from 7.36 to 6.09 Gu).

During the year, the Group rolled out approximately 3,500 projects
to improve the energy efficiency of systems and equipment; to
implement organizational measures such as process redesign and
optimization of plant capacity; and to increase energy awareness
among employees. These initiatives resulted in energy savings of
approximately 1,800 TJ and approximately â‚¬38 million, in addition to
avoiding approximately 145,000 tons of CO, emissions.

C02 AND OTHER MANUFACTURING
EMISSIONS

In 2018, CO, emissions were higher than the previous year due to
increased production in the NAFTA region but decreased by 9%
compared with the baseline year to 3.6 million tons.

years, falling from 0.62 tons per vehicle produced in 2010 to 0.45
tons per vehicle produced in 2018.

In 2018, to support our commitment to reduce CO, emissions, FCA
used energy from renewable sources. In Brazil, where the majority
of our South American plants are located, electricity originated
almost entirely from renewable sources, and our plants in Goiana,
Campo Largo and Jaboatao dos Guararapes obtained certification
as Carbon Neutral. In addition, solar power is used for electricity
and/or heating at some Group plants. Energy from renewable
sources used in Group production processes represented around
15% of total electricity consumption in 2018.
