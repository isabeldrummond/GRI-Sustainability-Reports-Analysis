SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS

Our analysis of material topics, including input from
key stakeholders, contributes to the development
of long-term sustainability-focused targets.

These targets cover priority areas for FCA, such as quality and
safety of vehicles; environmentally responsible products, plants
and processes; good corporate governance; a healthy, safe and
inclusive work environment; respect for human rights and dignity;
and constructive relationships with local communities and business
partners.

FCA establishes sustainability-focused targets and monitors
progress toward achievement through a three-phase approach:

In the Planning Phase, goals are drafted by the Sustainability Team in
collaboration with FCA‘s operating segments, regions and corporate
functions.

SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS

   

: Occupational
: Health and Safety

Corporate Governance
and Values

These proposed targets are submitted to the Group Executive
Council (GEC) which evaluates their consistency with the business
plan and strategy, and either approves or modifies the targets.

During the Management Phase, FCA‘s various operating segments,
regions or corporate functions are accountable for managing projects
and achieving the targets. These organizations take responsibility for
implementing the initiatives by bringing their unique resources, tools
and knowledge to bear in meeting the specific targets.

The Control Phase involves a series of project updates that target
owners provide to the Sustainability Team, which in turn informs the
GEC of ongoing progress.

The FCA Sustainability Report communicates progress toward
achievement of these targets to stakeholders on an annual basis.
