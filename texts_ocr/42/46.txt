DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

At FCA, we embrace a culture of diversity and inclusion that supports
our desire to constantly push ourselves ahead, leading to innovation
and excellence through collaboration and dynamic change.

Employees are expected to follow the business ethics and
behavioral expectations of FCA’s Code of Conduct that details the
Group’s commitment to maintaining a fair, secure, productive and
inclusive workplace for all members of our workforce, one in which
everyone is valued for their unique contributions to the Company.
The Company regards the diversity of our workforce as a key asset
and does not tolerate any form of discrimination.

We strive to ensure equal employment opportunities for members
of our workforce based on merit without regard to race, color,
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, age,
protected veteran status, marital status, religion, national origin,
disability status, genetic information, or other basis protected
by law. Promoting equal opportunities in the workplace is vital to
FCA’s human resources management and the Company’s long-
term success. A wider, more diverse pool of talent improves the
Company's understanding not only of our workforce, but that of our
customer base as well.

Several programs are in place across the Group to foster a diverse
and inclusive work environment among employees. The FCA US
Diversity Council works to foster opportunities for, among others,
women and ethnic minorities. Diversity within North America
is also represented by the Business Resource Groups (BRGs).
The BRGs (African Ancestry Network, Latins in Connection Network,
Asians Connected Together, First Nations, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance, Women’s Alliance and the FCA Veterans’ Group) provide
multicultural learning opportunities, mentoring and networking for
employees, and support for community outreach initiatives and
charitable events.

FCA is aligned with the vision of the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goal on Gender Equality through a number of
activities that aim to advance the role of women in the automotive
workforce. These include, among others, formal processes to
monitor the application of our core equity and fairness principles to
compensation levels, annual salary reviews and promotions, work-
life balance arrangements, and events to foster interest in technical
careers among women.

FCA received a number of recognitions for our commitment to
diversity in 2018. The Company is listed in the Thomson Reuters
Diversity & Inclusion Index, which includes the most successful
companies in promoting and leveraging diversity and inclusion in
the workplace. FCA is the only automotive company to be included
in the 2018 index. We were also recognized as one of Diversitylnc’s
“Noteworthy Companies for Diversity” and were included in Latina
Style’s 2018 list of Top 50 U.S. companies for Hispanic women to
work, marking the 15th year for this recognition.

The Company offers employment opportunities for individuals with
disabilities. A survey monitoring the employment of workers with
disabilities is performed every two years in countries where legally
allowed. The latest survey of the number of disabled workers was
completed in 2017 across 32 countries. Details are available in the
2017 Sustainability Report.

FCA launched a campaign to raise awareness and provide timely
information to employees on services to address a wide range of
disability issues. A two-day Diverse Abilities Awareness event at our
U.S. technology center connected employees with representatives
from organizations and support services to better understand how
and where to get individualized help for themselves or those they know.
