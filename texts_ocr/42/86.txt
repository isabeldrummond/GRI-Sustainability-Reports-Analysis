Customer Mobility

FCA focuses our efforts on the entire customer experience through
both traditional products and services and mobility solutions that
fit their changing needs. As an example, in 2018, FCA announced
a subscription-based car ownership program. This monthly
subscription service is expected to give customers access to FCA
portfolio vehicles and the ability to exchange the vehicle for another
FCA brand and model.

Another innovative service is U-Go, a peer-to-peer car-sharing
platform launched in Italy. U-Go offers an affordable car-sharing
option for individuals who do not own a vehicle or who need one for
a few hours or a few days. The vehicles available are from customers
of FCA Bank and Leasys, FCA Bank's long-term car rental company,
who rent or purchase full coverage vehicle insurance. The program
can defray customers’ relevant vehicle expenses by sharing their
vehicles when not being used.

These types of solutions are in addition to other mobility options
such as Enjoy. Enjoy is a car-sharing service that offers a fleet of
Fiat 500 and Fiat Doblo vehicles to urban drivers in Italy. It was
launched in Milan by Eni, an energy company, at the end of 2013 in
partnership with FCA, which has provided more than 2,500 vehicles.
Since the service was launched, approximately 830,000 individuals
in six metropolitan areas have signed up to use it and approximately
18 million rentals have been logged.

FCA also supports individuals with special mobility needs. For an
individual with a disability, accessible mobility can offer an increased
level of independence. At FCA, the Autonomy and DriveAbility
programs are designed to help customers with permanent disabilities
by providing financial assistance toward the purchase of appropriate
customizable adaptive equipment. Since 1995, the Autonomy
program has offered solutions that make it possible for people
with disabilities to drive Fiat, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Abarth, Jeep and
Fiat Professional brand vehicles. In 2018, there were more than
42,000 customized vehicles sold through the Autonomy program
to customers in Europe and Brazil. Revenues from the sale of these
vehicles in Italy totaled about €124 million in 2018. In addition, about
2,100 people benefited during the year from the services offered
through the Autonomy program's 18 Mobility Centers in Italy. These
Centers are managed in collaboration with local associations,
rehabilitation centers, health authorities and the department of motor
vehicles. The services offered include assistance with a range of
administrative, legal and technical issues, fitness-to-drive screening
assessments, and information on test drives.

The U.S.-based program, DriveAbility, is a financial assistance
program that was launched in 1987 to help customers with
permanent disabilities enter, exit and/or operate a new vehicle.
The program helps cover up to €847 of the expense for installing
adaptive driver or passenger equipment on most Chrysler, Jeep,
Dodge, Ram or Fiat vehicles. DriveAbility supplies vehicles to
a network of 25 vehicle modifiers, who operate more than 600
sales and service outlets across the U.S. The DriveAbility website
helps customers determine which vehicle and adaptive equipment
best suit their lifestyle, find the nearest sales outlet and apply for
reimbursement. Since 2010, the DriveAbility program has provided
more than 37,000 customer assistance grants. Along with financial
assistance for adaptive equipment, the program has provided
learning sessions where rehabilitation specialists present the latest
in advanced safety and convenience technology features available
to benefit special mobility needs.
