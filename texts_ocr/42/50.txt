Return-to-work and retention rates following parental leave are two
key indicators of the mid- and long-term capability of the Company
to provide employees with career growth opportunities and achieve
balance between their home and work lives. For further information,
refer to the Facts and Figures section of this report.

Financial health is also an important aspect of work-life balance.
An FCA initiative in Italy called Conto Welfare allows employees
to convert some of their pre-tax earnings into a spending account
they can use on a wide range of health, wellness, well-being,
care, education and pension benefits or services. In addition to
the tax benefit, the Company contributes an additional five to ten
percent toward their spending account. In 2018, more than 15,000
employees enrolled in Conto Welfare. This initiative supported
employee welfare and work-life balance, granting more affordable
access to services and resources from a wide range of local
providers. Flexible spending accounts available in the U.S. also give
eligible employees the opportunity to help pay for certain health care
and dependent day care expenses by setting aside a portion of their
pre-tax earnings as a selection of their benefit choices.

Recently, in the U.S., FCA supplemented the financial resources and
tools available to employees by offering a student loan refinancing
benefit. We recognize that this innovative offering is a way to attract
and keep top talent who have invested in their education as well as
the education of their children.

OCCUPATIONAL
HEALTH AND SAFETY

Throughout our facilities around the world, FCA aims to provide all
employees with a safe, healthy and productive work environment.
We focus on identifying and evaluating safety and health risks;
implementing health, safety and ergonomics standards; using
collaborative robots in manufacturing operations; promoting
employee awareness and safe behavior; and encouraging a
healthy lifestyle. Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) managers
are responsible at the Group level for establishing health and safety
operating procedures and standards, and for supporting local EHS
professionals in implementing them. In addition, they are responsible
for monitoring national and local legislation, as well as applicable
health and safety rules and regulations.

The goal of achieving zero accidents is formalized in the targets
set by the Company, as well as through the global adoption of an
Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS)
certified to the OHSAS 18001 standard. FCA has committed that
all of our plants operating worldwide in 2020 will be OHSAS 18001
certified. At the end of 2018, 94 Group plants, representing 96% of
manufacturing employees, or those directly or indirectly involved in
manufacturing processes, were OHSAS 18001 certified.

spending on health and safety

FCA has adopted World Class Manufacturing (WCM) methodologies
and tools, including a Health and Safety pillar, which also contribute
to improving safety in a systematic manner. WCM is a rigorous
manufacturing methodology that involves the entire organization and
encompasses all phases of production. See the Production section of
this Report for more information about WCM.

Effective implementation of health and safety standards at FCA facilities
is made possible through a combination of preventive measures and
the collaboration of employees. Employees are involved through
training that focuses on the importance of safeguarding health and
safety; complying with policies and procedures; contributing to the
adoption of additional safety measures; and promoting appropriate
prevention behaviors across all organizational levels and roles. They
are also engaged in initiatives designed to increase safety awareness
and participate in a comprehensive system for gathering feedback and
suggestions. Useful and implementable ideas are put into practice,
shared across multiple facilities and incorporated into FCA’s OHSMS,
and the project owners were recognized for their involvement.

 

FCA engages in ongoing dialogue about improving employee health
and safety with the employee-representative bodies in accordance
with current laws and the collective agreements applied in the various
countries in which the Group operates. The analysis conducted in
2018 revealed that 96.6% of employees covered by those bodies
were also represented on issues such as health and safety.
