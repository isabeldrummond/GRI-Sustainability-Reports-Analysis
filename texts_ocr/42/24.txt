Targets

2020: offer new products (vehicles and components) with environmental
performance certification through integration of ISO 14040/44-compliant
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies

2018 Results

@ Critical review by a third-party certification firm for compliance verification of the LCAs applied
to the following vehicles:
- Maserati Ghibli 3.0-liter 350 hp V-6 gasoline vs Ghibli 3.0-liter 275 hp V-6 diesel
- Maserati Levante 3.0-liter 350 hp V-6 gasoline vs Ghibli 3.0-liter 275 hp V-6 diesel
- Fiat Ducato 2.3-liter 130 hp diesel new version Euro 6 vs previous Euro 5 version

@ LCA completed on:
- Fiat Cronos Drive 1.3-liter Flexfuel vs Fiat Grand Siena Attractive 1.4-liter Flexfuel
- Jeep Renegade Longitude 1.8-liter Flexfuel vs Jeep Renegade Longitude 2.0-liter diesel

© LCA completed on:
- application of magnesium alloys on automotive components
- hot stamping processes

@ LCA started on all-new Jeep Wrangler vs previous model

 

2020: minimize environmental impact of materials used in vehicles

@ Began implementation in FCA European plants of the Global List of Automotive Process
Substances (GLAPS) approach

 

2020: increase the use of renewable and recyclable materials in
next generation vehicles with a focus on recycling and substitution
opportunities for critical raw materials

© Completed the collaborative work on the European Horizon 2020 ECAIMAN project
aimed at creating next-generation lithium-ion batteries

© Completed the Italian collaborative work on RICIRCOLA project, to recycle plastic
materials in the Melfi plant (e.g., scrap from bumpers) and to produce new components
internally

© Began collaborative work on the EU Horizon 2020 REINVENT project, aimed at
producing polyols from renewable sources and biomaterials

© Began collaborative work on EU Life BIOBCOMPO project for automotive weight reduction
through the development and use of biomaterials

@ 11 new applications of sustainable materials approved, including recycled materials for:
- Jeep Cherokee engine cover
- air cleaner housings on various vehicles
- synthetic suede for interior applications
- spare tire tub silencer

 

2020: outperform European Union reuse/recycling quota target (85%)
and reuse/recovery quota target (95%)

© All Group vehicles sold in Europe were 95% recoverable and 85% recyclable by weight

 

2020: improve efficiency in management of End-of-Life Vehicles (ELVs)
and exceed minimum regulatory requirements with expansion of qualified
and certified ELV network in relevant markets

© 100% of tires collected from dismantlers in Italy, resulting in approx. 25,800 tons being
used in recycling activities

© 274 dismantlers selected on the basis of environmental and quality criteria to serve the
FCA Italian ELV network

© Improved monitoring of ELV activities in 75 markets worldwide

@ Increased lithium-ion batteries end-of-life management within ELV network in most
relevant European markets.
