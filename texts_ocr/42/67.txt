The all-new 2019 Ram 1500 is one of the largest vehicles in the FCA
product range, but nonetheless represents what can be achieved
through innovation. The vehicle features technology and fuel
efficiency improvements that have not previously been offered in a
pickup truck. The powertrain and engineering attributes of the 2019
Ram highlight FCA’s commitments to improve vehicle fuel economy.

Fuel Efficiency

e 2019 Ram 1500 delivers significant gains in fuel efficiency with
an eTorque mild hybrid system on second generation 3.6-liter
Pentastar V-6 and 5.7-liter HEMI® V-8 engines

© eTorque combines a belt-drive motor generator unit with a 48-volt
battery pack to enable start/stop function, short-duration torque
assist and brake energy regeneration

e Fuel economy is U.S. EPA rated at 22 (combined) miles per gallon
(mpg) in rear-wheel drive and 21 (combined) mpg in four-wheel-
drive Ram 1500 models. The combined mpg rating is improved
10% from the previous model

e New generation of TorqueFlite 8-speed automatic transmissions

provides improved _ efficiency

with more powerful control
computers

Lightweighting

e Overall weight reductions total more than 100 kg net when
compared to previous model

e By using effective high-strength steels, composites and aluminum,
the 2019 Ram 1500 has dropped approximately 53 kg from the
chassis alone

e Additional weight reductions balance out added content to
provide new comfort and fuel-savings

e New frame features 98% high-strength steel to improve durability,
weight and rigidity for improved handling

e New aluminum tailgate

 

Aerodynamics

e New Ram 1500 is the segment’s most aerodynamic pickup with
0.357 coefficient of drag and features exclusive active aerodynamics:
grille shutters, air dam and air suspension
