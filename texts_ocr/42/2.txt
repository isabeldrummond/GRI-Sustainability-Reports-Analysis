MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND THE CEO

 

We want to thank everyone in the FCA organization for their
professional and personal contributions, during what was an
extraordinary year.

Thanks to them, we finished 2018 in the strongest financial position
since FCA was created. We achieved record results and a number of
significant milestones, which have paved the way for our next phase
of growth and profits.

The year was also marked by a sudden and unexpected change
in leadership following the untimely passing of Sergio Marchionne.

That was a tough moment for all of us, including on a personal level,
but our organization was well prepared to manage this unexpected
transition because, from the very beginning, Sergio had the humility
and wisdom to see that the ultimate fulfillment of his role as a leader
was to teach those around him also to be leaders.

Notwithstanding the difficult circumstances, we were able to move
rapidly, ensuring stability in leadership and steadiness of vision.

Keeping in mind where we came from and the journey that has
brought us thus far, we will carry this organization forward with a
very Clear vision of what it takes to achieve our ambitions.

We firmly believe that we have the depth and breadth of talent and skills
we need to shape the future of this organization exactly as we envision
it: acompany with a global horizon and unlimited possibilities, working
to become one of the most profitable automakers in the world.

This vision draws its strength from the collective spirit of our people
- united by the same strong commitment to the values that drive
our business and our lives: integrity and discipline, openness to
feedback and constructive debate, and full acceptance that we are
each accountable.

In 2018, we reached a net cash position for the very first time.
Industrial free cash flows more than doubled to €4.3 billion", leading
to anet industrial cash position of €1.9 billion at year-end.

On that basis, the Board of Directors is recommending, for the
first time in nearly ten years, to reward our shareholders with the
reinstatement of ordinary dividends.

Including Magneti Marelli, which is classified as a discontinued operation for the year ended December 31, 2018.
