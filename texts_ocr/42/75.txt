Regulatory Actions

On January 10, 2019, we announced that FCA US reached final
settlements on civil, environmental and consumer claims with the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of
Justice, the California Air Resources Board, the State of California,
49 other States and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, for
which we have accrued €748 million, of which approximately €350
million will be paid in civil penalties to resolve differences over diesel
emissions requirements. We also announced that FCA US had
reached settlements in connection with a putative class action on
behalf of consumers in connection with which FCA US agreed to pay
an average of $2,800 per vehicle for each eligible customer affected
by the recall.

The settlements do not change the Company’s position that it did
not engage in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to
cheat emissions tests. Further, the consent decree and settlement
agreements contain no finding or admission with regard to any
alleged violations of vehicle emissions rules.

We remain subject to diesel emissions-related investigations by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department
of Justice, Criminal Division. In addition, we remain subject to a
number of related private lawsuits and the potential for additional
claims by consumers who choose not to participate in the class
action settlement.

We have also received inquiries from other regulatory authorities
in a number of jurisdictions as they examine the on-road tailpipe
emissions of several automakers’ vehicles and, when jurisdictionally
appropriate, we continue to cooperate with these governmental
agencies and authorities.

In Europe, we have been working with the Italian Ministry of Transport
(MIT) and the Dutch Vehicle Regulator (RDW), the authorities that
certified FCA diesel vehicles for sale in the European Union, and the
UK Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). We also initially
responded to inquiries from the German authority, the Kraftfahrt-
Bundesamt (KBA), regarding emissions test results for our vehicles,
and we discussed the KBA reported test results, our emission
control calibrations and the features of the vehicles in question.
After these initial discussions, the MIT, which has sole authority for
regulatory compliance of the vehicles it has certified, asserted its
exclusive jurisdiction over the matters raised by the KBA, tested
the vehicles, determined that the vehicles complied with applicable
European regulations and informed the KBA of its determination.
Thereafter, mediations have been held under European Commission
(EC) rules, between MIT and the German Ministry of Transport and
Digital Infrastructure (BMVI), which oversees the KBA, in an effort
to resolve their differences. The mediation was concluded with
no action being taken with respect to FCA. In May 2017, the EC
announced its intention to open an infringement procedure against
italy regarding Italy’s alleged failure to respond to EC’s concerns
regarding certain FCA emission control calibrations. The MIT has
responded to the EC’s allegations by confirming that the vehicles’
approval process was correctly performed.

in addition, at the request of the French Consumer Protection
Agency, the Juge d’Instruction du Tribunal de Grande Instance
of Paris is investigating diesel vehicles of a number of automakers
including FCA, regarding whether the sale of those vehicles violated
French consumer protection laws. In December 2018, the Korean
Ministry of Environment announced its determination that 2,428
FCA vehicles imported in Korea during 2015, 2016 and 2017 were
not emissions compliant and that the vehicles with a subsequent
update of the emission control calibrations voluntarily performed by
FCA, although compliant, would have required re-homologation of
the vehicles concerned.
