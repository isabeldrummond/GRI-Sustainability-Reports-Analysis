LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT

FCA uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental
impact of materials, components, design and production processes.
LCA considers multiple factors, such as energy and other resources
consumed during production; use and recycling; and waste
generation, which are measured based on ISO 14040 and ISO
14044 standards. Critical reviews by a third-party certification
company verify the compliance of selected LCA studies with these
standards. Collaborative LCAs related to materials, processes
and automotive components are also conducted within several
internationally-funded projects.

The results from vehicle LCAs may help contribute to the
development of new, more environmentally-friendly products. In
2018, Life Cycle Assessments completed include:

e Maserati Ghibli 3.0-liter gasoline vs 3.0-liter diesel

e Maserati Levante 3.0-liter gasoline vs 3.0-liter diesel

e Fiat Ducato 2.3-liter diesel Euro 6b vs 2.3-liter diesel Euro 5+
Fiat Cronos 1.3-liter Flexfuel vs Fiat Grand Siena 1.4-liter Flexfuel
e Jeep Renegade 1.8-liter Flexfuel vs Jeep Renegade 2.0-liter diesel

VEHICLE END-OF-LIFE
MANAGEMENT

Pursuing a responsible approach across the value chain means
looking beyond the design, production, delivery and use phases.
FCA designs our products so that their environmental impact is also
reduced at the point when the customer discards the vehicle at its
end-of-life stage.

In the U.S., the environmental effects of vehicles at the end-of-life
stage are reduced using a market-driven recycling infrastructure,
making automobiles and their components among the most recycled
consumer products in that country. In other markets, local legislations
regulate end-of-life management activities and responsibilities. In
the European Union, for example, EU Directive 2000/53 and the
Circular Economy package describe required reuse, recycling and
recovery activities. FCA participates in the review process of end-of-life
vehicle (ELV) policies, supporting the development of new standards or
regulations, such as vehicle and battery recycling.

In 2018, all Group vehicles sold in Europe were 95% recoverable
and 85% recyclable by weight, in compliance with the EUâ€™s Reusability,
Recyclability, Recoverability Directive.

FCA provides recyclability and recoverability information on vehicles
exported to countries with ELV regulations. The FCA Vehicle Recycling
Laboratory at the Automotive Research and Development Centre
(ARDC) in Canada plays an important role to support vehicle end-of-
life research and development. The ARDC performs vehicle teardowns
to satisfy dismantling requirements for ELVs, and provides or helps
confirm existing part information that is used to generate more accurate
recyclability and recoverability information.

As our electrified vehicle portfolio continues to grow, FCA explores
solutions for the life cycle management of lithium-ion batteries.
We have partnered with a supplier on a program that collects high-voltage
lithium-ion batteries and finds use for these batteries elsewhere.
The Electric Vehicle Battery Recycling program is important due to the
significant environmental footprint of these batteries. When batteries
become available, FCA or a business partner notifies the supplier
who retrieves and transports them for repurposing in non-automotive
applications such as personal mobility devices, including motorized
wheelchairs. This initiative offers consumers of these goods a lower
cost option for the replacement of their batteries in addition to being
a zero waste-to-landfill solution. Additionally, FCA participates in the
U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium, a collaborative organization of
automakers. This work group contains a number of battery-related
projects, including those focused on recycling lithium-ion batteries to
produce new cathode materials, which can reduce cost and increase
energy density.

REMANUFACTURED PARTS

Dependence on raw materials for parts creates demand on natural
resources, a demand that FCA strives to reduce by employing
circular economy principles.

To provide a second life for selected parts used in FCA vehicles, the
Company has developed specific product lines of remanufactured
parts. These parts support the aftermarket needs of customers,
simultaneously reducing the cost of vehicle ownership and decreasing
the volume of salvageable materials heading to landfills. The FCA
remanufactured product lines include air conditioning compressors,
starters, alternators, brake calipers, electronic control modules,
torque converters, steering and suspensions, as well as engine and
transmission product categories. The number of product offerings
continues to grow and represents more than 4,500 part numbers
globally.

Through external specialized providers, FCA certifies the production
of remanufactured parts in order to provide a repair solution that
is equivalent to original equipment parts, and that carry the same
warranty conditions as new parts.
