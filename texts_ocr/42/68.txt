POWERTRAINS AND ELECTRIFIED
PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES

Maximizing powertrain efficiency is part of FCA’s commitment to
reduce vehicle CO, emissions and improve fuel economy. This
means not only developing more efficient engines and transmissions,
but also optimizing the vehicle/powertrain systems. Selection of the
most suitable powertrain is based on vehicle type and use.

Engines

New global small and global medium displacement gasoline
engine families have been developed to improve fuel economy and
emissions. These engine families feature a modular approach using
a shared cylinder design (allowing for different engine configurations,
displacements, efficiency and power outputs). When fully deployed,
these engine families will cover a large range of vehicle applications
and introduce features and technologies such as direct fuel injection,
downsizing, integrated exhaust manifold, Multiair variable valve lift,
turbocharging, and cooled exhaust gas recirculation. All of these
features enable the engine families to be competitive among small
and medium displacement engines with respect to fuel consumption,
performance, weight and noise, vibration and harshness (NVH)
behavior.

Both a 1.0-liter three cylinder and a 1.3-liter four cylinder naturally
aspirated Firefly global small engine were launched in the LATAM
region in 2016, and in 2018 the turbocharged variants of the global
small engine launched in the EMEA region (in the Jeep Renegade
and Fiat 500X). In November 2018, FCA announced a new module
at the Termoli plant (Italy) for production of turbo, naturally-aspirated
and hybrid versions of the 1.0-liter and 1.3-liter Firefly engine.

The first global medium engine application (a 2.0-liter turbo four
cylinder engine) was launched in the Alfa Romeo Giulia in 2016.
In 2018, a dual overhead camshaft version of the global medium
engine (with cooled exhaust gas recirculation) became available in
the Jeep Cherokee and Jeep Wrangler. To meet increasingly more
stringent air quality standards, we have employed the use of gasoline
particulate filters with both global engine families in some EMEA and
APAC markets.

FCA has been engaged in the development of new and improved
aluminum alloys for engine use. This work has demonstrated an
aluminum alloy capable of a 50% increase in strength at 300° Celsius
when compared to other currently used aluminum alloys. While still
in very early development, this type of alloy strength behavior has
the potential to provide increased design flexibility for cylinder heads
and cylinder blocks and help to enable increased engine efficiency.

Electric and Hybrid Technologies

FCA has developed a suite of electrification technologies, including:
12-volt engine stop-start, 48-volt mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and
full battery electric vehicles, all of which offer improvements in fuel
economy and a reduction in CO, emissions. These developments
have occurred at FCA technical centers primarily in Auburn Hills
(U.S.), Modena and Turin (Italy). Substantial work has also been
performed with suppliers and universities located around the globe.

The 12-volt stop-start system turns off the engine and fuel flow
automatically when the vehicle comes to a halt and re-starts the
engine upon the driver disengaging the brake. Phase-in of this
technology began in 2013 model year and in 2018 it was used in
approximately 42% of FCA’s global production volume.

In 2018, FCA launched three applications of mild hybrids using
belt starter generator (BSG) technology. BSG technology offers
improvements in fuel economy and a reduction in CO, emissions.
This new 48-volt mild hybrid technology is marketed as “eTorque”
in the all-new 2018 Jeep Wrangler equipped with the 2.0-liter
turbo engine and the all-new 2019 Ram 1500 3.6-liter and 5.7-liter
applications. The system offers faster and smoother stop-start
functionality, a real-time powertrain efficiency optimization manager
which balances motor and engine torque, enhanced and extended
fuel shut-off during certain maneuvers, and regenerative braking to
recharge the 48-volt battery. The system also delivers significant
gains in fuel economy. For example, the 2019 Ram 1500 5.7-liter
HEMI V-8 equipped with eTorque has a 13% improvement in city fuel
economy and 10% reduction in combined CO, over the base HEMI
in a 4x2 Crew Cab model.

The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid achieves an efficiency rating of 82
miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe), based on U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency testing standards and has an approximately 72%
reduction in CO, compared to the non-hybrid Chrysler Pacifica.
Power to the wheels is supplied via a 16 kWh battery through
the hybrid electric drive system which is comprised of a specially
adapted new version of the award-winning Pentastar 3.6-liter V-6
engine and the new eFlite hybrid transmission. This vehicle was
introduced in the China market in 2017.

The Fiat 500e is FCA‘s full electric vehicle offering and is available
only in the NAFTA market. It has an all-electric range of 84 miles
and achieves 121 MPGe City, 103 MPGe Highway and 112
MPGe Combined. Since its introduction in the 2013 model year
approximately 25,000 units have been sold.

At FCA’s Capital Markets Day held on June 1, 2018, FCA revealed
our 2018-2022 business plan, which presented our expectation to
continue reducing CO, emissions. The plan anticipates that we will
offer 12 electrified propulsion systems (battery electric, plug-in hybrid
electric, full hybrid and mild hybrid) in global architectures spanning
the full range of vehicle segments. The plan also anticipates that
by 2022, 30 nameplates will feature one or more of these systems.
Specific applications will align with each of FCA’s brand attributes.
