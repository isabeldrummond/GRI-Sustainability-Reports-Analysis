In accordance with the GRI Standards, entry-level salary is defined as the minimum compensation paid to a full-time employee hired at the lowest pay scale/employee grade on the basis of company
policy or agreements between the company and trade unions. For each country, results are based on the company with the lowest ratio of entry-level salary to minimum wage, unless the number of
employees of the company with the lowest ratio represented less than 10% of that country’s total headcount. Figures reported are as of December 81, 2018.

The survey of 19 countries covered the Group's total workforce. Workplace equality within the Group is also seen in the comparison between minimum entry-level wages by gender. Considering

the countries included in the survey sample, minimum wage levels were found to be identical between men and women.
