As we continue efforts to deliver advancements in safety technologies,
ratings from independent agencies help validate our progress.
Independent agencies rate the comparative safety of vehicles across
the industry in different regions. While the specific criteria vary, these
ratings generally evaluate the level of safety provided for occupants
during a crash as well as a vehicle's ability to avoid a crash through
the use of technology. Over the years, FCA vehicles have earned top
ratings based on performance during assessments. For example, the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) named the 2019 Chrysler
Pacifica a Top Safety Pick and the Fiat 500X was awarded the Latin
NCAP 5-Star rating.

Independent rating agencies, such as Euro NCAP and IIHS, have
required increasingly stringent protocols to achieve five-star safety
ratings. FCA has taken these protocols into consideration as we
develop and test our safety systems.

Regulatory Compliance

When potential vehicle safety issues arise, we promptly investigate
and take corrective action, including initiating safety recall campaigns
when appropriate. FCA aims to improve the overall customer
experience during the safety recall process and increase completion
rates. We use a set of industry-leading advanced data analytics in
the U.S. to improve our ability to more rapidly and effectively identify
and assess potential safety issues. By quickly identifying potential
safety issues, we are able to investigate and make determinations
regarding appropriate safety recalls to address safety issues
promptly and inconvenience fewer customers. In 2018, there were
148 recall campaigns involving 14,016,521 initial recall notices for
FCA vehicles worldwide.

Through the Global Technical Compliance organization, the vehicle
safety investigation and safety recall execution process has been
harmonized to enhance coordination across regions and the
robustness of safety recall campaign remedies for our customers.

We continue to investigate and implement ways to further improve
customer engagement and experience related to safety recalls
through both regional communication channels and our Customer
Contact Centers (CCC). For example, FCA took a significant
step in recall customer outreach in 2018 by launching an all-new
customer relationship management system for our CCC specialists.
The planning, process and actual contacts for all recall outreach,
including phone, postal mail and digital, is now managed by the
Customer Care team. Volume in 2018 exceeded 27 million outreach
attempts.

In addition, the Check To Protect public awareness campaign was
launched by the National Safety Council (NSC) and FCA US to
raise awareness of the importance of customers checking regularly
for open recalls. The campaign drives customers to the NHTSA
database of all open recalls and urges customers to take action to
repair vehicles quickly. In 2018, the National Automobile Dealers
Association also joined with the NSC in support of the Check To
Protect campaign and to educate and raise awareness about the
importance of getting recall repairs completed.

VEHICLE QUALITY

FCA strives to satisfy our customers by continuing to bring new
technologies and products to market, with improved quality and
reliability. Customersâ€™ needs and expectations vary from market
to market due to differences in driving experiences and local
preferences, which is why our customer-focused approach to quality
during vehicle development is key. One measure of this approach
is reflected in the results of the J.D. Power 2018 U.S. Initial Quality
Study. The FCA brands included in the study improved initial quality,
on average, at a faster rate than the U.S. industry average for the
third consecutive year.

To measure progress toward improving vehicle quality, FCA has set
a target of achieving top quartile placement for the vehicle portfolio
by 2020, based on the relevant competitive benchmark for each
geographic region. This includes vehicle reliability as measured
by rate of repair and survey results related to vehicle functionality
and design. In 2018, the rate of repair in the first 90 days of
ownership improved on average by approximately 1% globally.
Things Gone Wrong (TGW) is an internal and external survey process
that evaluates customer needs and behaviors related to vehicle
functionality and design issues. In 2018, TGW improved on average
by approximately 2% in three regions (NAFTA, EMEA and APAC).
The LATAM region launched a new external survey methodology and
is not included in the scope.
