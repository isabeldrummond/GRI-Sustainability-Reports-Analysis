FCA’s Environmental Guidelines detail our
commitment to address environmental and climate
change issues by aiming to reduce CO, emissions,
energy consumption, water withdrawal and waste
generation. Our environmental responsibility also
entails efforts to preserve natural habitats and their
biodiversity in areas surrounding our sites.

Environmental protection at FCA is managed through our
Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) and Energy organizations.
The Group has implemented an Environmental Management
System (EMS) worldwide, aligned with the ISO 14001 standard.
The EMS consists of a system of methodologies and processes
designed to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of the
Group’s manufacturing activities. At the end of 2018, 97 Group
plants, representing nearly 100% of industrial revenues, were ISO
14001 certified. The plants still awaiting certification have already
adopted an EMS that is aligned with the ISO 14001 standard and
are regularly audited by the EHS organization.

FCA’s Energy Management System (EnMS) focuses on
methodologies and processes related to the optimization of energy
use. At the end of 2018, the majority of Group plants were ISO
50001 certified, representing approximately 99% of the Group’s
total energy consumption.

The Group EMS and EnMS are certified by accredited third parties.
Together with World Class Manufacturing (WCM) methodologies
and tools, they support our efforts to achieve a steady and
consistent reduction in the impact of manufacturing processes.

As a key contributor to our environmental stewardship, the WCM
program was first adopted more than 10 years ago and has been
implemented at FCA plants worldwide. WCM is an approach that
applies to all areas of the manufacturing facility. It seeks to eliminate
waste and increase the productivity, well-being, and safety of the
individuals who work there. The projects developed within WCM aim
to ultimately reach zero accidents, zero waste, zero breakdowns
and zero inventories.

At year-end 2018, 95 FCA plants have implemented WCM, which
covers 99% of our plants: 27 have achieved a WCM bronze
level of implementation and performance, 32 silver and six gold.
The achievement of WCM award levels recognizes the long-term
commitment of the workforce to making significant changes that
can secure the future of a facility. During an audit, zero to five points
are awarded for each of the 10 technical pillars, which include
safety, workplace organization, logistics and the environment,
and for each of the 10 managerial pillars, such as management
commitment, clarity of objectives, allocation of people, motivation
of operators and commitment of the organization.

The success of WCM is highly dependent on the participation
of employees, who are involved in targeted training programs in
order to properly apply WCM methods. Employees worldwide
are also encouraged to make process improvement suggestions,
each of which is assessed for potential application. In 2018, FCA
plant employees submitted more than 2.4 million suggestions,
representing an average of 17 proposals per employee. Best
practice projects are shared among all plants, with approximately
22,000 approved and disseminated across the Group’s plants

throughout 2018.

of FCA plants apply WCM

There were roughly 5,000 environmental projects started during
2018, for an estimated cost savings of €52 million.

WCM tools and methods are also applied to non-production
business processes. FCA is transferring WCM principles and
best practices to our logistics, manufacturing engineering, design
activities, dealers and suppliers. By expanding the WCM approach
and principles to various FCA business functions and business
partners, FCA strives to minimize the environmental footprint along
our value chain while promoting a culture of sustainability.
