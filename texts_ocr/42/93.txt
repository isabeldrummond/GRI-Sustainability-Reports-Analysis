SUPPLIER
MANAGEMENT

 

Managing the complexity of multi-tier supply chains presents
particular challenges for all major industries, including the
automotive sector. Technology is driving change in the
automotive industry, as vehicles today are becoming more
connected, electrified, autonomous, and shared. The vehicle
design cycle is more stringent, technologies are adopted more
quickly, and automakers are collaborating with suppliers more
than ever before.

Collaboration and respect will continue to provide the best
way to address challenges the global supply chain may face.
The FCA Code of Conduct and the due diligence processes
are based on the Group’s commitment to mitigating potential
emerging environmental and social risks related to the supply
chain.
