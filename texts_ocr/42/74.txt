Other Markets

In countries in the APAC and LATAM regions, including those without
specific regulations governing CO, emissions or fuel consumption,
FCA offers vehicle technology designed to reduce both.

Brazil

In July 2018, the first regulations related to Rota 2030 were enacted
in Brazil, the major market in the LATAM region. Rota 2030 is a long-
term program (three cycles of five years each) which includes key
principles related to energy efficiency for all vehicles sold in Brazil.
Key Rota 2030 regulations were approved by the Brazilian Congress
and sanctioned by the Brazilian President in December 2018 as well
as ordinary regulations to address certain minimum requirements
and other metrics.

The regulation for the next phase of Energy Efficiency (CO,/fuel
efficiency) beginning in 2022 incorporates three fleets split into
passenger, large SUV and light commercial vehicle categories.
Among other things, the rule rewards the improvement of sugar cane
ethanol combustion efficiency and also recognizes and provides
credit flexibilities for technologies that provide benefits in conditions
that are not seen on the standardized government test cycles.

In Brazil, gasoline contains 22% ethanol, diesel contains 8%
biodiesel and pure ethanol (E100) accounts for about 30% of sales
by volume. More than 374,000 Flexfuel vehicles were registered in
2018, accounting for approximately 86% of the vehicles licensed
by the Group in this market. FCA participates in the government's
vehicle fuel consumption monitoring program (PBEV - Brazilian
Labeling Program Vehicle).

China

China 5 standards, which mirror Euro 5 standards, are currently in
place in China nationwide. China 6 standards were released in 2016
and will be required nationwide beginning in July 2020 with China
6a thresholds and in July 2023 with China 6b thresholds. China
6a and 6b have more stringent tailpipe emissions thresholds than
Euro 6 and also add European Union (EU) real driving emissions
and U.S. onboard diagnostics, onboard refueling vapor recovery and
evaporative emission control system requirements. Some regions
within China will implement China 6b prior to July 2023, such as
Beijing (beginning in early 2020) and Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou
and Shenzhen (beginning in July 2019) with more regions expected
to follow. FCAâ€™s entire China fleet has been developed with the intent
to meet China 6 standards.

With respect to fuel economy, in China Phase IV of the Corporate
Average Fuel Consumption (or CAFC) is currently in place and
provides an industry target of 5.0 liters per 100 kilometers by 2020.
Each OEM must meet a specific fleet average fuel consumption
target related to vehicle weight. The phase-in of this fleet-average
requirement began in 2016, with increasing stringency each year
through 2020. Additional provisions for Phase IV include meeting
a quota for New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) beginning in 2019. NEVs
consist of plug-in electric hybrids, battery electric vehicles, and
fuel cell vehicles. No off-cycle credit flexibilities exist in the China
regulation, although credit multipliers are granted for NEVs.

A draft version of the Phase V rule has been distributed by the
Chinese government with increasing stringency reaching a target of
4.0 liters per 100 kilometers by 2025.

In September 2017, China's Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology released administrative rules regarding CAFC and NEV
credits that became effective in April 2018.

The Group aims to implement fuel efficient technical solutions
such as engine stop-start (ESS). The 2018 Jeep Wrangler and
locally-produced Jeep Renegade, Jeep Compass and Jeep Grand
Commander have ESS as a standard configuration. In addition
to ESS, the new Jeep Wrangler offers the 2.0-liter global medium
engine with turbocharger. It delivers a 2.6 liters per 100 km fuel
savings compared to the previous model with the 3.0-liter Pentastar
engine. The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid was launched in China in April
2018, contributing to the fuel efficient technologies FCA offers in the
region.
