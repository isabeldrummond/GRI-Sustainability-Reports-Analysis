MAIN COLLABORATIVE EUROPEAN PROJECTS

Project name

L3 Pilot

Project focus

Autonomous Driving Project: In L3 Pilot thirteen car makers will perform field trials on vehicle automation in a wide range of driving situations, including
parking, highway, and cities. L3 Pilot tests will evaluate the technical aspects and the overall impact on traffic and society. In L3 Pilot, FCA is managing all
pilot activities across the European test sites.

 

5G Transformer

5G is the new revolutionary generation of cellular network. FCA is investigating the potential of the 5G cellular network in the automotive domain for
infotainment, traffic information and, in the future, traffic safety.

 

5G Carmen

The 5G Carmen project will build a 5G-enabled corridor from Italy to Germany to conduct cross-border
trials of 5G technologies in three major use cases: vehicle maneuver negotiation, infotainment, and eco-driving.

 

InDrive

InDrive demonstrates the future use of mass-market GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), targeting automotive applications with high
demands for integrity and creating a framework that specifies the requirements for data acquisition, signal tracking and data fusion in order to
guarantee the proper handling of positioning data.

 

C-Roads Italy

C-Roads Italy, coordinated by the Italian Ministry of Transport, will deploy and test vehicle cooperative systems in real traffic conditions, for automated
driving applications of truck platooning, passenger car highway chauffeur and combined car-truck scenarios. FCA will evaluate how the exchange of
messages among cars, trucks and road infrastructure will make the “highway chauffeur” function more resilient to different traffic conditions.

 

OPTEMUS,

The OPTEMUS (Optimised energy management and use) project aims to improve the energy efficiency of electrified vehicles significantly by
developing innovative core technologies (such as battery housing and insulation for thermal and electric energy storage) and complementary
technologies including localized climate conditioning combined with intelligent controls (e.g., eco-driving and eco-routing strategies).

 

DOMUS

The DOMUS (Design and OptiMisation for efficient EVs based on a USer-centric approach) project focuses on defining a user-centric approach for
the design of the new-generation electric vehicles by developing innovative solutions for the cabin intended to provide a significant improvement in
energy efficiency while offering optimal comfort and safety.

 

ALLIANCE

The ALLIANCE (Affordable Lightweight Automobiles AlliaNCE) project brings together partners from across the lightweighting value chain to develop
innovative materials and their respective manufacturing technologies. The aim is to decrease the energy consumption of cars by 10%, decreasing
lifecycle environmental impact (in terms of GWP), and ensuring that the developed technologies achieve widespread adoption to keep the cost of
lightweighting affordable.

 

ECOXY

ECOXY project focuses on a circular economy approach for the use of recyclable, reshapable and repairable, bio-based fiber-reinforced epoxy composites.

 

HEAT TO FUEL

HEAT TO FUEL project focuses on the next generation of biofuel production technologies supporting the de-carbonization of the transportation sector.

 

REVALUE

REVALUE project aims to develop an innovative technology to recycle carbon fibers, applied to the automotive sector.
