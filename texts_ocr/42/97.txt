The second phase of assessing suppliers is the creation of the risk
map. Direct material suppliers are analyzed and rated on criteria
that include:

e FCA spending on supplier

e country risk associated with the supplier’s home country, with
particular emphasis on countries with a poor human rights record,
according to the Worldwide Governance Indicators

supplier's financial risk

e supplier's SSSA score

supplier's exposure to commodity risk based on process or labor
intensity

e location of supplier’s main production activities (where available
or Known).

The risk map score indicates a supplier’s overall risk level and is
used to prioritize supplier audits.

sustainability audits
conducted at suppliers

On-site supplier sustainability audits - in the form of both announced
and semi-announced/unannounced - represent the third and
most intensive phase for confirming supplier compliance, and are
conducted by either internal Supplier Operations Engineers or
external auditors. In 2018, we increased the number of suppliers
audited, expanding from 48 in 2017 to 88 in 2018. This not only
helps FCA, but strengthens our suppliers as well by identifying
areas of improvement in which they can close gaps, becoming
stronger and more sustainable. If any critical issues are identified
during an audit, a supplier may be placed on watch status or, in
particularly severe cases, the relationship with the supplier may
be suspended or terminated. Where areas for improvement are
identified, a corrective action plan is developed by FCA, the supplier
and with the support of the third party auditors where applicable.
Action plans establish specific responsibilities within the supplier's
organization, activities and deadlines for implementation.

The level of supplier sustainability compliance based on self-
assessments and on-site audits are reported on the Global External
Balanced Scorecard, which provides standardized supplier metrics
across all regions. Suppliers’ sustainability performance is captured
as a strategic indicator and is available on all regional scorecard
views.

The Group plans to conduct sustainability audits or assessments
of all Tier 1 suppliers with potential exposure to significant
environmental or social risks by 2020.

SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL
PERFORMANCE

Climate change is not an issue that can be solved in isolation. We
expect our suppliers, dealers, contractors, business partners,
licensees, and joint venture partners to comply with all environment-
related rules and regulations, and to adopt measures and standards
contributing to an overall improvement in environmental impact
throughout the value chain. We work with our suppliers and
encourage them to implement an environmental management
system aligned with international standards.

The Supplier Sustainability Self-Assessment (SSSA) includes a
module dedicated to the supplier’s environmental management
initiatives. SSSA submissions reflect a supply base that is
seeking to optimize its use of resources and minimize emissions
and greenhouse gases; properly managing waste treatment and
disposal; managing energy and water use and adopting logistics
processes with minimized environmental impact.

FCA supply contracts specify our support of responsible
procurement by requiring every material’s adherence to
environmental, health and safety requirements, and covers
ingredients, formulas and handling procedures where relevant.
These requirements extend to our procurement practices through
the use of tools such as the International Material Data System
(IMDS) and Life Cycle Assessment.

Suppliers are required to submit detailed information on the
material content and substances used in production and service
parts through IMDS so substances can be traced back to the
specific component. In this way, FCA can monitor, control, reduce,
or eliminate regulated chemical substances that are restricted or
prohibited in one or more markets.
