Biofuels

In Europe, all engines sold are compatible with blends of up to 10%
bioethanol with gasoline (E10), and up to 7% biodiesel with diesel
(B7). In Brazil, FCA has a full range of Flexfuel vehicles that run on
varying blends of gasoline and bioethanol. Brazil has an extensive
bioethanol distribution network, supported by long-standing
government policies and readily available raw materials. In 2018,
more than 374,000 FCA Flexfuel vehicles were registered in Brazil,
accounting for approximately 86% of vehicles licensed by the Group.
FCA also offers vehicles capable of running on gasoline blends
containing up to 85% ethanol (E85 flexible fuel) or biodiesel blends
of up to 20% (B20) in the NAFTA region.

EFFICIENCY SOLUTIONS

FCA augments our powertrain innovations by integrating
technologies that optimize energy demand of our vehicles. These
include improving aerodynamics, reducing weight, minimizing tire
rolling resistance and brake drag, offering engine stop-start systems
and using thermal control technologies.

The wider use of smart technologies, which provide dynamic
management of the vehicle's powertrain systems, has contributed
to an improved balance between performance and fuel economy.
These technologies include smart charging, optimized engine
cooling systems and cylinder deactivation. The value of thermal
management, or using available “waste” thermal energy, is being
leveraged in multiple products. This approach allows vehicle systems
to operate at a higher efficiency by tailoring individual components to
run at more optimal temperatures. The Group believes that there is
still significant potential to reduce the fuel consumption and emission
levels of these engines through technological advancements.

Improved Aerodynamics

Fuel economy can be improved by optimizing vehicle aerodynamic
performance. FCA strives to reduce the aerodynamic drag of our
vehicles, and also uses active aerodynamic technologies that
are automatically activated under certain conditions to improve
aerodynamic drag and reduce fuel consumption and CO, emissions.
Depending on the vehicle, these active technologies may include
active grille shutters, active aero front splitters, and air suspension.

From the earliest development stage, the aerodynamic performance
of every vehicle profile is measured, optimized, tested and certified in
the world-class, full-scale, aerodynamic wind tunnels of the Group.

The 2019 Ram 1500 achieves a 0.357 drag coefficient. The vehicle's
aerodynamic performance contributes to its fuel efficiency and
features exclusive active aerodynamics including grille shutters, air
dam and air suspension.

Weight Reduction

FCA aims to design and produce lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles
that also meet the expectations of our customers. This includes
adopting a number of weight reduction solutions that help manage
vehicle energy demand and improve fuel economy. For example,
the 2019 Ram 1500 achieved a total weight reduction of more than
100 kg compared to the outgoing model, by using high-strength
steels, composites and aluminum. The frame is made from 98%
high-strength steel and notable weight reductions were made by
switching to aluminum in the tailgate, engine mounts and other
chassis elements.

Minimizing Tire Rolling Resistance

FCA uses a variety of solutions to reduce rolling resistance, which
contributes directly to improvements in fuel efficiency and CO,
emissions. Low rolling resistance tires, for example, are offered on
selected FCA models globally.

EMISSIONS AND FUEL ECONOMY

FCA addresses the fuel economy and CO, emissions of our vehicles
at the start of the product development process by focusing on:

© powertrain technologies (e.g., engines, transmissions, hybrid and
electric propulsion)
e vehicle energy demand (e.g., aerodynamics, weight, tire performance).

FCA vehicles must comply with comprehensive local, regional and
national laws and regulations with respect to vehicle emissions and
fuel economy. The Group develops technologies that respond to
these regulatory requirements, while also addressing vastly different
consumer preferences and demands around the world. In support
of this, the Vehicle Safety and Regulatory Compliance organization in
the four regions where FCA operates report to the Company's Chief
Technical Compliance Officer.

4G The wider use of smart technologies, which
provide dynamic management of the vehicle’s
powertrain systems, has contributed
to an improved balance between performance

and fuel economy. 95
