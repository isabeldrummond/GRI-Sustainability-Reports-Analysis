SUPPLIER SUSTAINABILITY

Suppliers to FCA commit to operating responsibly. This commitment
to social, ethical and environmental principles is a condition to both
becoming an FCA supplier and to developing an ongoing business
relationship with us.

Suppliers must conduct business activities according to ethical
standards and procedures set forth by FCA. The Company’s
General Terms and Conditions require any new purchase order
with suppliers to align with the principles set forth by FCA's policies,
including the FCA Code of Conduct and the FCA Sustainability
Guidelines for Suppliers. If a supplier fails to meet these standards,
a corrective action plan, jointly developed with FCA, is required.
Additional actions may be adopted by FCA in case of non-
compliance, including and up to termination of the business
relationship.

FCA’s Sustainability Guidelines for Suppliers, available on our
corporate website as well as the supplier portal, focus on the
following principles:

GES Human rights and working conditions

e rejection of the use of forced or child labor in any form

© recognition of the right to freedom of association in accordance
with applicable laws

¢ freedom from harassment and discrimination

e guarantee of equal opportunities, fair working conditions,
appropriate working time, equal compensation, and the right to
training for employees.

SUPPLIER ASSESSMENT PROCESS

Preliminary Evaluation

Before FCA conducts business with a company, an evaluation
helps determine its suitability based on a broad set of criteria.
Through the Supplier Eligibility Assessment (SEA), we identify
a potential supplier’s strengths, weaknesses and capabilities
to produce parts of the required quality, performance and cost,
and evaluate whether it has the potential to be a high-performing
supplier for FCA. An extensive redesign of the SEA was initiated
in 2018 and requires potential suppliers to complete the same
Supplier Sustainability Self-Assessment (SSSA) expected of our
established suppliers. If a potential supplier shows deficiencies
in any area of the assessment, a gap closure strategy is created
to bring the supplier into compliance before business is sourced.

The SEA is conducted prior to the procurement phase for those
suppliers who are not currently providing parts to FCA. It can also
be used in situations in which a supplier's location has not delivered
a product type for more than 12 months, even if the supplier has
already been assessed for other facilities, products, or commodities.

Potential suppliers must demonstrate that they have adopted a
program that promotes sustainability, both internally and along the
supply chain; a code of conduct; a certified system for managing
employee health and safety; and a certified environmental
management system. These conditions help ensure that they
monitor and manage environmental aspects, labor practices,
human rights, and their impact on society.

The SEA consists of an audit carried out at the supplier's facility and
is generally preceded by the completion of a Supplier Data Profile.
Subsequently, if required, corrective actions, responsibilities, and
target dates for resolution can be defined for all identified items.

Sustainability Assessment of Suppliers

The assessment of supplier compliance with sustainability criteria is
conducted through three phases.

The first phase consists of the SSSA questionnaire, which covers
environmental issues, labor practices, human rights, compliance,
ethics, diversity, and health and safety topics. Active FCA suppliers
are expected to complete the SSSA each year.

This standardized tool was developed by the Automotive Industry
Action Group (AIAG) in collaboration with FCA and other automakers
and suppliers. This assessment has a two-fold purpose: to
determine the level of sustainability activity within the supply base
and to communicate FCA's expectations to our suppliers.
Suppliers complete the SSSA online by accessing it via the FCA
eSupplierConnect portal.
