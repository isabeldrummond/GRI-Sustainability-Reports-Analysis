employees. The Agreement with Unifor is in effect until September
21, 2020.

Mexico

83.8% Unionized 16.2% Nonunionized

In Mexico, FCA Mexico, S.A. de C.V. applies the four-year agreement
reached in June 2016 with The Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores
de la Industria Automotriz Integrada Similares y Conexos de la
Republica Mexicana representing more than 15,000 employees.
This agreement is in effect until May 9, 2020.

At the European level, regulations require that all community-scale
undertakings establish a European Works Council (EWC), which
ensures workers the right to information and consultation. FCA first
established an EWC in 1997 on the basis of the agreement signed in
1996, and which was subsequently renewed with amendments and
modifications. The last renewal agreement for the FCA EWC, signed
in July 2016, was in effect until the end of 2018. As provided by the
agreement itself, it has been automatically renewed.

Overall, in 2018, collective bargaining conducted in accordance with
local law and practices, resulted in 349 trade union agreements at either
the Company or plant level.

In 2018, the level of labor unrest and local labor action in Group
companies was negligible and mostly related to local issues at individual
plants.

Management of Production Levels

During 2018, the management of production levels varied within the
regions based on market demand.

e Inthe EMEA region, the response strategy to the contrasting levels
of market demand for certain models continued in 2018 leading to
the use of forms of flexibility depending on the required volumes.
In cases where it was necessary to manage temporarily reduced
production, the Company continued our policy for employment
protection by taking advantage of temporary layoff schemes or
schemes defined by collective bargaining or company policies.
In 2018, the use of temporary layoff benefit schemes by Italian
Group companies was often supported by training and retraining
programs for workers.

In April 2018, FCA Italy signed a trade union agreement for the
Polo Produttivo Torino which includes the Mirafiori Plant / Unita
Sottogruppi Lastratura Grugliasco and Aw. Giovanni Agnelli Plant
(Italy) and provides for on-the-job training initiatives as well as
training and retraining programs targeted at certain categories of
employees to ensure their continued employability. To enable an
overall rebalancing of employment and to set preconditions for
potential opportunities of occupational turnover, the Company
and the trade unions also agreed on the voluntary departure of
employees close to meeting pension requirements. This will be
managed through a procedure for workforce reduction of 1,050
employees to be completed by the end of July 2019, and for the
payment of a voluntary redundancy incentive.

The industrial plan for Italian plants was presented to the trade
unions in November 2018. It includes the launch of restyled
Maserati models currently produced at Polo Produttivo Torino and
the installation of a full Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) platform at
the Mirafiori plant/Unita Sottogruppi Lastratura for the new Fiat
500 Elettrica. As a result, during retooling in 2019, employees
will receive on-the-job training as well as other targeted training.
Since full working activity for all workers of Polo Produttivo Torino
is not expected in 2019, the consequent temporary overstaffing
will be managed through temporary layoff benefit schemes, in
agreement with the trade unions.

In Italy, FCAâ€™s production systems brand, Comau, realigned
the mission of the Grugliasco site to address changes in the
competitive European market resulting from the introduction
of new technologies. In 2018, Comau started an investment
program to introduce new products at the site, which resulted in
a temporary overstaffing. This was managed through temporary
layoff benefit schemes, in agreement with the trade unions.
Subsequently, an agreement between the Company and the
trade unions enabled employees close to fulfilling pension
requirements to leave the company on a voluntary basis by the
end of June 2019. The agreement included the identification of 72
redundancies. The parties also agreed on the amount that will be
paid as a voluntary redundancy incentive.
