Learning Management

To remain competitive industry undergoing
transformational change, employees are encouraged to envision a
career that involves continuous learning. FCA offers a number of
development opportunities, including training, coaching, mentoring
and job rotations.

The Group invested approximately €40 million in training during
2018, delivering 1.7 million hours of training to about 117,500 Group
employees.

Investments in classroom, online and on-the-job training focused
primarily on the Group’s four core training concepts: development
of job-specific know-how (71.9%), managerial skills (4.9%), cross-
cultural awareness and language skills (12.0%) and corporate
campaigns, rules and commitments (11.2%).

Where possible, FCA endeavors to measure the direct business
impact of our training activities, in addition to monitoring process
efficiencies and effectiveness. The Cost Deployment of Training
model, used within the World Class Manufacturing (WCM) program,
can be applied to a portion of total training costs. By monitoring
on-the-job training and the associated generation of process
improvements, FCA identified estimated savings of approximately
€4 million enabled by a training cost of about €1.6 million in 2018.

Recently, a new approach to learning at FCA was launched through
the FCA Learning City, an innovative virtual learning platform.
This platform enables employees to grow, share and challenge
their individual professional skills with other colleagues in a learning
community that:

e facilitates learning and self-development by means of gamification
e favors networking and sharing of expertise
challenges top learners to resolve real business cases.

This approach to learning puts employees at the center of
their development paths, in a setting of self-accountability and

empowerment.

Through this learning platform, a training project called the
Sustainability Boulevard was made available to roughly 40,000
employees worldwide in 2018. This project, in its second edition,
provides FCA employees with clear evidence of ways our
sustainability efforts and results are integrated with our business, and
how the various business areas can contribute to FCA’s sustainability
efforts.

Dialogue with Employees

We believe that dialogue is an important contributor to employee
satisfaction, so FCA seeks to foster a company culture where new
ideas are encouraged and valued at every level. Formal opportunities
for exchange and dialogue include town halls, engagement surveys,
employee meetings, team-building events and department
gatherings. We use these opportunities to plan and address specific
actions aimed at maximizing overall employee satisfaction and

engagement.

2.4 Million

suggestions from
employees worldwide

During 2018, more than 20,700 hourly and salaried employees
were involved in various engagement surveys. In some instances,
these engagement campaigns were customized to match an
organizational need, and deployed to particular segments of the
Company or to employees worldwide from the same business
area. This and other information derived from the above-reported
initiatives allow FCA to evaluate and develop appropriate actions.

Several tools and programs are also in place worldwide to collect
suggestions from employees. The World Class Manufacturing
(WCM) program offers our largest worldwide example of employee
engagement. In 2018, 2.4 million WCM suggestions were collected
to foster shared learning and best-in-class performance. Across
the organization, other suggestion channels are available for the
collection of improvement proposals, resulting in an additional
34,000 ideas generated through direct and spontaneous
engagement of employees worldwide.
