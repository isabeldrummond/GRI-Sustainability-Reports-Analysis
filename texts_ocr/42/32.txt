The Governance and Sustainability Committee is elected by the
Board of Directors and is comprised of at least three Directors. More
than half of the members shall be independent and at most one of
the members may be an executive Director.

During 2018, the Governance and Sustainability Committee met
once with 100% attendance of its members at that meeting. The
Committee reviewed the Board’s and Committee’s assessments,
the sustainability achievements and objectives and the
recommendations for Directors’ election.

SUSTAINABILITY MODEL

FCA\s sustainability model incorporates the need to implement robust
processes as well as strengthen cultural buy-in to simultaneously
achieve our economic and social responsibility objectives.

The Group has established processes to align our long-term business
strategy with the needs of internal and external stakeholders, to
assess our ability to meet these targets, and to identify opportunities
for improvement. The commitment to sustainability arises from a
corporate culture that includes integrity, respect for others and a
commitment to community service.

In order to implement meaningful sustainability practices and optimize
the management of sustainability aspects within the Company, FCA
involves every area, every function and every employee, from the top
of the management chain to workers in plants and offices around the
world. The Group also actively promotes environmental and social
responsibility among our many suppliers.

Several entities within the Group, primarily those referred to below,
help direct a disciplined approach to sustainability management.

The Board’s Governance and Sustainability Committee evaluates
proposals related to strategic sustainability initiatives, advises the full
Board as necessary, and reviews the annual Sustainability Report.

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is supported by the Group
Executive Council (GEC), a group led by the CEO and composed
of senior leadership from regional operations, brands, industrial
processes, and support/corporate functions. The GEC approves
operating guidelines and plays a vital role in ensuring that
sustainability efforts are aligned with economic and business
objectives.

The Chief Audit, Sustainability and Compliance Officer is also a
member of the GEC and coordinates the activities of the Sustainability
Team. The Sustainability Team, with members located in Italy,
Brazil, China and the U.S., facilitates the process of continuous
improvement, contributing indirectly to risk management, cost
optimization, stakeholder engagement and effective communication
to stakeholders of our commitments and results.

Discussions between stakeholders and the Board Committee
regarding sustainability issues are carried out by the Sustainability
Team as part of its assignment to maintain an interchange with
internal and external stakeholders. Reports on these dialogues
are then included in the annual disclosure and conveyed to the
Governance and Sustainability Committee.

CODE OF CONDUCT

The Code of Conduct is a pillar of the integrity system which regulates
the decision-making processes and operating approach of the Group
and our employees in the interests of stakeholders. The Code of
Conduct amplifies aspects of conduct related to the economic,
social and environmental dimensions, underscoring the importance
of dialogue with stakeholders.

FCA endorses the United Nations (UN) Declaration of Human
Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions
and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Companies. The FCA Code of
Conduct is intended to be consistent with such guidelines and aims
to ensure that all members of the Company's workforce act with
the highest level of integrity, comply with applicable laws, and build
a better future for our Company and the communities in which we
do business.

The FCA integrity system is comprised of these primary elements:

e Principles that capture the Company commitment to important
values in business and personal conduct
e Practices that are the basic rules that must guide our daily behaviors
required to achieve our overarching Principles. The Practices
supplement the Principles with useful detail
Procedures that further articulate the Company’s specific
operational approach to achieving compliance and that may have
specific application limited to certain geographical regions and/or
businesses as appropriate
Statements, including Guidelines, that cover specific issues to
emphasize the Company's accountability and commitment to a
culture of responsibility and integrity. These cover, among others,
matters related to human rights, competition, sustainability for
suppliers, environmental management, responsible taxation,
advertising and marketing communication, and Conflict Minerals.
The FCA Guidelines were updated and posted to the Company
website in 2018.

The Code applies to all Board members and officers of Fiat Chrysler
Automobiles N.V. and its subsidiaries, as well as full-time and part-
time employees of FCA and any of our subsidiaries. The Code
also applies to all temporary, contract and all other individuals and
companies that act on behalf of FCA, wherever they are located in
the world.
