Supporting communities in an emergency

When disaster strikes, FCA and our employees mobilize to help
the affected communities and victims. Depending on the need,
this assistance may take the form of technical, humanitarian and
financial aid. FCA’s disaster support also means helping nonprofit
organizations to be prepared before an emergency, so they can be
ready to deploy their resources.

In 2018, violent storms such as Hurricanes Florence and Michael
had a devastating impact on thousands of lives, and in some cases,
entire communities. The FCA Foundation contributed €174,600 in
grants to three organizations providing support to residents and
communities affected by these events: Americares, which responds
to natural disasters and humanitarian crises worldwide; Team
Rubicon, which unites the skills and experiences of U.S. military
veterans with first responders to rapidly deploy emergency response
teams; and First Response Team of America, which provides post-
disaster services for search and rescue and recovery operations.

Social Team Building: impacting local community needs

FCA employees in Italy are given the opportunity to participate in a
social team building activity. Partnering with local municipalities and
districts, FCA assesses community needs and directs our efforts to
positively impact them. In 2018, a group of FCA employees from
the Turin (Italy) area participated in an improvisation theatrical show
for children with serious illnesses. Another employee volunteer
project during 2018 involved beautifying a Turin-area high school,
including painting and freshening the interior of the building to make
the learning experience more enjoyable for students. Participating in
these activities together helps promote a sense of belonging among
employees, and strengthens the relationship between the Company
and the communities where we do business.

Arvore da Vida: developing local communities

Since 2004, FCA has supported a unique social project called
Arvore da Vida in the Jardim Teresdpolis community, near the
FCA Plant in Betim (Brazil). The program aims to promote social,
cultural and economic growth by encouraging the independence
and empowerment of local residents. More than 22,400 people
have benefited from the program since its inception. In 2018, one
of the most challenging goals of the program was fulfilled: Arvore da
Vida became a nonprofit institute composed of, and managed by,
members of the community and individuals who have participated
in the program throughout its history. Through the institute, the
community will assume a leading role, make all relevant decisions
and define its own partnerships, which could include FCA,
governmental entities, or other companies - thus greatly expanding
the available opportunities.

Cooperarvore: combining entrepreneurship
and environmental responsibility

Another Brazilian program that focuses on local entrepreneurial
activities to generate income is Cooperarvore, a social cooperative
formed in 2006 by women from the community surrounding the
FCA Betim plant. FCA donates fabric and seat belt remnants
from the plant, and Cooperarvore transforms them into fashion
accessories and other items. Over the past 12 years, Cooperarvore
has contributed to improving the quality of life for more than 70
households in the area. Since it was created, Cooperarvore has
repurposed about 38 tons of material and produced 270,000
products. Besides the positive impact on the families involved, the
program illustrates the benefits of the circular economy, putting
potential waste to good use.

Rain Water Harvesting Program

In India, water scarcity is a critical issue facing communities and the
resident population. Fiat India Automobiles Private Limited (FIAPL)
launched a Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) project in 2014 in water-
deficient areas of the Pune District in Maharashtra. During 2017 and
2018, the company has created additional rain water harvesting
opportunities with the potential to capture 265 million liters in seven
villages. In the affected communities, these efforts have resulted
in an increase in the ground water table, an increase in the area
under irrigation, a reduction in tanker water supply during summer,
increased awareness of water conservation concepts and improved
sustainable management of scarce water resources.

A recent partnership between FCA and 3M extended our water
conservation works to the drought-prone areas of the Latur District in
Maharashtra. This partnership involves water conservation activities
at 25 sites, which have the potential to create rain water harvesting
opportunities of 134 million liters.

Share Your Heart: Crowdfunding FCA Japan

Since 2014, FCA has been supporting local communities in Japan
through a crowdfunding activity called “Share Your Heart.” Projects
are chosen based on the causes that are embraced by FCA brands,
including education for children, female empowerment, inclusion,
community support, environmental protection, and hospitalized
children. The initiative aims to “connect hearts and share happiness”
among our internal and external stakeholders. In the past five years,
the platform has raised approximately €230,000 for 34 projects as a
result of donations from more than 2,400 contributors.
