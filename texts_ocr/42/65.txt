We are collaborating with Waymo, Google’s self-driving technology
company, to integrate its self-driving technology into the Chrysler
Pacifica Hybrid. Production of the first 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid
minivans built to enable fully self-driving operations was completed
in late 2016, with nearly 600 minivans joining Waymo’s self-driving
test fleet to date. In 2018, we announced that we would expand our
partnership with an agreement to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica
Hybrid minivans to Waymo’s self-driving fleet.

We have launched Highway Assist autonomous vehicle technology
on several Maserati models. This system includes Mobileye vision
technology to enable autonomous driving on designated highways.
We are also partnering with BMW for Level 3 autonomy and with
Aptiv for Level 2+ advanced driver assistance retail solutions.
FCA is also working with our suppliers to develop a cloud-based
global connectivity solution that will connect to the Internet and
an FCA-specific service delivery platform to allow the driver
and passengers to interact with the car and the outside world.
The solution is intended to be scalable, increase safety and security,
and provide real time availability of services and information.

CYBERSECURITY

Although “being connected” has gained in importance among
many individuals, there is a fast-growing concern in the automotive
industry related to cybersecurity. In response, FCA has put in place a
cross-functional team of professionals focused on the cybersecurity
of our corporate systems and vehicles through activities such as
threat monitoring, design enhancements, and third-party penetration
testing. Cybersecurity is considered throughout a vehicle’s life
cycle, including during development, manufacturing and service.
In addition, FCA continues to offer a financial reward for discovery
and reporting of potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities through a
crowdsourced bounty program. FCA is a founding member with
active engagement in the Automotive - Information Sharing and
Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC). The Auto-ISAC enhances the industry's
ability to quickly learn of new threats and vulnerabilities and to work
in a collaborative manner on threat triage.
