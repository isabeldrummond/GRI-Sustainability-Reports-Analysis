MATERIALS AND SUBSTANCES

FCA supports using recycled and renewable materials in our new
products. The amount of renewable or recycled content included
in our vehicles varies depending on performance requirements and
the market availability of such materials. For some types of materials
in our vehicles (¢.g., metal), the percentage of recycled content
is significant, less so for other materials such as polymers and
elastomers, though efforts are in place to increase the percentages.

Material innovation and development is conducted by FCA’s Group
Material Labs (GML) in Europe and the Materials Engineering
organization in the U.S. The GML also monitors changes in legislation
and assesses potential implications on the Group’s products and
processes. In 2018, the Materials Engineering organization approved
sustainable materials for use in FCA vehicles. These materials contain
recycled or bio/renewable content, or low emissions polymers. The
new applications included recycled content on the Jeep Cherokee
engine cover and air cleaner housings, and grades of synthetic suede
for several vehicles.

FCA has established a closed-loop process to return aluminum and
steel scraps to selected suppliers in Europe, and recycle them back into
our manufacturing processes. Up to 25% of aluminum casting parts
used in some powertrain applications in Italy are secondary alloys. We
also promote the use of recycled plastics in our design requirements.
For example, we manufacture gasoline tanks internally that are up to
39% recycled plastic by weight for certain European applications.

FCA participates in a variety of collaborative projects related to
materials research, including:

e the SPIDER project, that aims to produce safe and environmentally
friendly lithium-ion batteries by reducing or substituting critical
raw materials like cobalt and graphite with other more sustainable
metals such as nickel, titanium and silicon.

the European Union’s CarE-Service project, that aims to
demonstrate innovative Circular Economy business models
based on advanced mobility services. FCA's activities are mainly
focused on re-use, remanufacturing and recycling end-of-life
batteries from hybrid and electric vehicles.

the REINVENT project, with the objective of producing polyols
from renewable sources and bio materials from forest residue.

a cooperative research project with FCA, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (U.S.) and a casting supplier, which created a new
aluminum alloy for use in engine components. This alloy maintains
its strength in heat well beyond components in current use, and
can be cast and machined using existing technologies.

ea recently completed project with the Canadian National
Research Council, to optimize nonwoven eco-substrates for
interior trim applications and the fabrication of components on
an industrial scale. The project successfully identified several bio-
reinforcements capable of being used in door panel applications,
as well as practical uses for recycled carbon fibers in similar
applications.

Substances of Concern

FCA works to eliminate or reduce the use of Substances of
Concern (SoC) that may impact human health or the environment.

We use the International Material Data System (IMDS) to track
the composition of individual materials and components in
our vehicles. Data from IMDS is then fed into FCA internal
management systems, which are used to monitor the content of
all vehicles and identify the presence of SoCs. These systems are
crucial for tracking vehicle recyclability and recoverability, as well as
monitoring SoCs included on the Global Automotive Declarable
Substance List (GADSL).

FCA‘s internal standard of restricted and prohibited SoCs is made
available to suppliers worldwide, which are required to adhere to
IMDS and SoC disclosure obligations. It provides uniform global
requirements, regardless of where the products are ultimately
sold or marketed, that minimize market-specific uncertainty or
interpretation while increasing transparency and clarity.

FCA has developed vehicle “indoor air” quality (VIAQ) evaluation
standards which are part of our material approval process for
interior materials. That approval process includes odor, Volatile
Organic Compound (VOC), and other testing on in-cabin air and
components to reduce detectable interior odors as well as to
improve customer satisfaction.

FCA’s attention focuses on substances identified in globally
regulated Substances of Concern restrictions like the REACH
regulation and heavy metal ban. This level of awareness and
commitment to compliance is also critical to FCA suppliers
with whom we collaborate closely in identifying technically and
environmentally sustainable substitutes for substances that will be
restricted in the near future.
