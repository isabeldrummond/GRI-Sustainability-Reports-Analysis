Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2019

Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2019

 

 

Letter to our Stakeholder

Weare proud to present the third Consolidated Non-financial Declaration (NFS) of the El.En Group.
This document is intended to give you the opportunity to know more about us and to evaluate
our commitment, our objectives and the results obtained in the field of social responsibility. This
document, in fact, is about us, our values, the daily commitment of each person who works for
this company, what in which we believe and our ambitions.

In 2019 we made important steps in this direction starting with the definition of the Sustainability
Plan which had been approved in 2018. This year we started to take concrete action towards the
goals which had been set by taking tangible action. Our main efforts were directed towards the
spreading of the culture of sustainability, the involvement of our employee, the improvement of
the welfare of the staff and the working environment, the support of the technological innovation
and the quality of our products and the increase of the positive social impact generated by our
business.

During this year we achieved some important results which we will summarize here briefly and
which you will find in greater detail in the text which follows.

Our staff continues to represent our most important resource. Again this year El.En created
employment by increasing their number of employees throughout the world by 10%. This is
a significant increase not only at a numerical level but also in consideration of the enrichment
represented by the arrival of new employees with different experience and know-how. During
the year we promoted the spread and consolidation of the culture of sustainability by conducting
training sessions in some of our subsidiary companies and describing the objectives and the
activities which we must undertake in order to achieve them; we also increased the number of
hours dedicated to training and, besides the usual training sessions conducted to guarantee the
personal and professional growth of the personnel, we instituted courses dedicated to specific
subjects like Governance, Compliance and Ethics in order to meet our commitment to spread
certain ideals at every level.

Thanks to the remodeling of some of the buildings at the company Headquarters in Calenzano
and the construction of new factories for some of the subsidiary companies, we were able to
improve the work space by creating environments that were peaceful and productive in order
to stimulate the potential and the creativity of the individual, and rest areas created for the
employees; this work was conducted following criteria of high energy efficiency and reduction
of environmental impact.

During the year the parent company, EI.En. S.p.A. approved three important documents: the
Environmental Policy, the Human Rights Policy, and the Anti-corruption Policy. These subjects
had already been discussed in the Ethics Code, however, our desire to increase awareness in this
regard induced us to call attention to our commitment by adopting specific policies.

Again this year the efforts of the Group in relation to innovation of the products and processes
have continued with success. The research activities conducted in our laboratories and the
collaboration which we have established with important research centers, hospitals and
universities continue uninterrupted both on a National and International level both in the
medical and industrial sector. The companies in the Group which manufacture medical devices
have obtained the MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program) certification, a program which
allows the recognized and authorized institutions of the five member countries (U.S.A., Canada,
Brazil, Japan and Australia) to conduct a single audit in the factory of the producer of medical
devices; moreover, we are in the process of obtaining, by the end of 2020, certification according
to the new EU regulations for medical devices (MDR) 2017/745..

The commitment of El,En as a company is also expressed through their initiatives sustaining the
community. Every day we make an effort to assure that our work produces a positive impact on
the lives of people and, with some specific products, we donate our expertise and our instruments
to non-profit organizations, foundations and avant-garde scientific laboratories at the service of
the health of patients as well as those involved in the conservation of our artistic legacy.

The companies that belong to the El.En. Group are strongly connected to the communities in
which they operate and have always been involved in sustaining cultural, social and educational
activities through sponsorship, participation in associations as well as promotion of school/work
programs, and internships.

For these reasons we can affirm that this year we have re-enforced our desire to be a sustainable
Group which wishes to combine economic growth and financial stability with the principles of
social and environmental sustainability in order to represent a model of excellence.

The results obtained and the trust of our stakeholders encourage us to continue in this direction
by innovating with passion and remaining faithful to the values and principles which have always
been characteristic of our mission and giving our contribution to the building of a better future
for all.

The President
