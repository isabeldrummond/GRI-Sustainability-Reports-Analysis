We are committed to creating a working environment
that is constructive and dynamic and supports the
heterogeneity of people and talents, is stimulating
and offers opportunities for professional growth. The
management of the human resources of the Group aims
at the integration and respect of all the diversities, and
rejects any form of discrimination based on nationality,
sexual orientation, age, political or religious opinions. The
Group sustains and respects the rights of the individual
in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights issued by the United Nations, and is committed
to avoiding any form of discrimination. This commitment
also applies to all aspects of work relations including
hiring, training, job assignment, promotions, transfers
and severance.

Equally important for the creation of an inclusive work
environment are the initiatives promoted to facilitate the
balance between family life and the workplace, starting
with the possibility of working part-time.

The Group is committed to the need to create a dialog

with its employees for the purposes of reconciling the

requirements of the individual with those of the company.

This commitment is demonstrated in the management
of different categories of contracts: from national and/
or sector contracts to collective/corporate contracts and
even contracts stipulated individually.

In particular, in Italy they apply a National Collective Work
Contract (the personnel is 100% covered by collective
contract), in Germany, the workers' committee signs a
collective agreement on an annual basis (86% of the
employees are covered by collective contracts; the rest
are selling personnel who underwrite a different type of
contract); in France the apply to all of the employees the
Collective Convention IDCC nÂ°1982; in Brazil the annually
conduct a collective negotiation, while in China and in
Japan they follow the local legislation. Moreover, in Japan
the management conducts a monthly meeting with its
employees to discuss any relevant issues. At the Group
level, it should be noted that 57% of the employees
are covered by agreements stipulated on the basis of
collective bargaining.
