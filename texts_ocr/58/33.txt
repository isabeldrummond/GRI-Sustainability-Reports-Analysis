+ Financial soundness;

+ Experience in the sector;

+ â€” Reliability;

+ Technical and planning resources and capacity;

+ Manufacturing capacity;

+ Use of systems for the control of the quality and

safety of the products, consistent with the requests
of the Group.

In the selection process and in their relations with the
suppliers, the Group evaluates, consistent with the internal
procedures and the company program, the economic
benefits in reference to the objectives of solvency and long
term profitability, as well as the presence on the market, the

technical capacity and the reliability of the persons involved.

In particular, for the manufacturing companies of the Group
the selection of the suppliers follows a precise procedure
of qualification and approval to guarantee the quality

of the product and the respect of the delivery times.

According to this procedure, using a "Supplier Qualification
Request Form" we evaluate the general level of the Quality
Control System of the supplier, with an aim to constantly
improve the aspects which influence the quality of the
product or the service which we are buying; for purchases
of merchandise we also make trial orders which allow us to
conduct inspections directly on the product.

For products and services of a certain kind, like the services
offered by testing laboratories, the qualifying procedure and
approval is based mainly on the analysis of the certifications
that the supplier possesses, because the authority of the
certifications and of the institutions that have issued them
are a guarantee of reliability. Occasionally we also conduct
audits at the supplier's; at the end of the analysis, on the
basis of the results of all the tests that have been run, the
supplier will either be included or excluded if his quality
level is found to be insufficient.

Once the supplier has been judged to be suitable from
a qualitative point of view, periodic inspections are
programmed to make sure that the standards of quality
required have been maintained: these evaluations take
into consideration aspects such as flexibility of the
supplier, ie. his capacity to adapt to the requirements
of the organization, the speed of response to and the
management of contingencies, the organizational structure
and punctuality of deliveries as well as the evaluation of
the merchandise delivered. Annual inspections are also
conducted at some supplier's by specially trained internal
auditors, both routinely or on account of an anomalous

66

situation of non-conformity, like a decline in the quality of
the product or services.

As indicated in the Sustainability Plan, during the process
for the qualification and approval of a supplier, we have
included the evaluation of some aspects related to
sustainability issues so that they can be used as evaluation
parameters and contribute to the overall evaluation
of the potential supplier. The new qualification criteria
were elaborated and inserted in 2019 and will be in force
starting in 2020.
