EI.En. donated two lasers to the Uffizi Galleries in Florence. The lasers will be used to restore
works of art, in particular the statues in the Boboli Gardens and the paintings in the Galleries.
The lasers that will be at the Uffizi are the “Thunder Compact” by Quanta System S.p.A.
(subsidiary of the El.En. Group), which is used to clean stone materials (marble, stucco, bas-
reliefs) and the “Light Brush” by El.En./Deka, with erbium technology, which is used to restore
paintings and frescoes.

“Resurrect beauty wherever it is and give it to the future generations - - Paolo Salvadeo,
General Director of El.En. has said. - That is what we are here for. We are particularly honored
that (the director of the Uffizi Galleries) Eike Schmidt has accepted our donation. This is a
further confirmation of his sensitivity towards art which is a universal heritage which we
have the duty of protecting, passing on to posterity the great message of beauty and
love that the great artists of the past have left for us”.

“One of our greatest concerns has always been the protection of our artistic heritage Schmidt
said, and we are glad to accept this donation because with the El.En. lasers we have instruments
for the conservation of works of art which will allow us to intervene without affecting their
integrity while enhancing their beauty. Moreover, this collaboration makes us particularly
proud because it is based on Italian technology, actually Florentine technology, which is
recognized and exported all over the world”.
