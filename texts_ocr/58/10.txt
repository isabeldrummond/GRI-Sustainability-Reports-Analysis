Plan, we tried to bear in mind also the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), promoted by the United
Nations and published in the 2030 agenda for Sustainable

Development and we identified 18 objectives of
sustainability for the Group which we believe through
our efforts can contribute to the achievement, in
particular, of nine of the seventeen SDGs.

The five-year Sustainability Plan 2018-2022, with the
implementation of the policies intended to generate and
distribute resources to all the stakeholders represents
the mid- to long-term vision of the Group and the means
for communicating the objectives and the actions to be
undertaken in order to achieve them.

By combining the corporate mission with the
Sustainability Plan, the El.En. Group is able to respond to
the challenges offered by the market while proposing a
sustainable development which will be log lasting over
time.

In relation to the 14 material topics identified and
represented in the materiality matrix, the Sustainability
Plan sets 18 sustainability objectives and 43 concrete
actions which must be undertaken in order to achieve
them.

Each objective is related to a specific macro-area

(Governance, Economic _ responsibility, | Product

Social responsibility, and Environmental responsibility)

and to the related issues in each sector;

for its business and in line with its goals;

take into consideration the results which have been
achieved and those which still need to be reached as
well as the new issues which have emerged over time.
