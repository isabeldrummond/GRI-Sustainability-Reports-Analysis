“ The data related to energy consumption for the month of December 2019, unless otherwise specified, have been taken from the
invoices issued by the suppliers of energy services. The data related to energy consu,ption of the companies located in Calenzano have
been in part estimated on the basis of their consumption in December of 2018. The consumption of vehicle fuel for the cars belonging
to the Italian companied located in Calenzano and some of those belonging to Lasit S.p.A., have been estimated on the basis of the

cost, by means of the average price of gas and diesel fuel (Euros per liter) as reported on the site of the Ministry of Economic Development.

"4 cont.) For the automobiles with mixed use, we considered as 70% of the total consumed. Moreover, as a consequence of the refinement of the
monitoring system for electrical energy and gas atthe Chinese subsidiaries of the Group, the data for 2018 for the geographicarea called“The Rest
of the World” have been revised with repect to those published in the previous NFD. For these latter, please consult the preceding NFD which is
publishedonthesitewww.elengroup.com.|nthesection ofInvestorRelations/Sostenibilita/Bilanci.In ordertocalculatetheenergy consumption
in GJ we used the conversion factors of the Department for Environmental Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), UK, for 2019 and 2018 respectively.
