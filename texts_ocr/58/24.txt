Nevertheless, they have identified the most sensitive

areas and have inserted a special section dedicated to the
prevention of crimes of this type in the Organizational
Model. The analysis therefore started with the mapping
of the activities and the identification of the risk related
to each of them by attributing a certain number of
points. The parameters used for the point system were:
the number of times it had happened in the past, the
existence of company procedures, the impact of the
penalties for this type of crime and the frequency of
the event. We decided that the frequency of the event
and the impact of the penalties made it opportune to
dedicate a part of the Organizational Model to all the
preventive activities related to this kind of crime, even
if the occurrence in the past (no event of this type has
taken place) and the existence of company procedures
lowered the risk. The Ethics Code also contains precise
directives related to correct behavior which are intended
to avoid the occurrence of corruption. In 2019, no cases
or reports of corruption were registered.

In order to guarantee the principles contained in the
Ethics Code and the effective implementation of the
systems for the flow of information and controls described
in Model 231 the companies of the Group that initiated it

make use of a Supervising Body which is appointed by
the Board of Directors; The main duty of the Supervisory
Body is that of monitoring and, when necessary, reporting
to the Board of Directors any irregularity or violation, and
to supervise the respect of the procedures set up by the
Company, as part of the prevention plan of the so-called
assumption crimes, identified after an in-depth analysis
which includes corporate crimes and crimes related to
health and safety in the workplace.

The El.En. Group believes that knowledge and adhesion
to the principles of the Ethics Code and Model 231 must
be promoted through specific training projects for the
people who work within the organization: again this year,
for some of the Italian companies we have conducted
specific training in relation to Model 231 which were held
by members of the Supervisory Body which reached 277
employees during the year.

At Quanta System S.p.A., Asclepion GmbH, and the
Chinese subsidiaries all newly hired employees must
attend a specific training course on the Ethics Code of
the El.En. Group which in 2019 reached 172 employees,
while in the other subsidiary companies the Ethics Code
is distributed in paper copy when they are hired. These
activities will be continued in order to spread these
principles more broadly within the organization.

FOCUS: The respect of human rights

The Group sustains and respects the rights of the individual in conformity with the
Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations and, consequently, requires the greatest
respect for people and for the regulations that are applicable in relation to work; they
do not tolerate any behavior that is discriminatory or threatens the safety of people. The
Group considers impartial treatment to be a fundamental value in every relationship both
within and outside of the company and believes that the individual, his/her ideologies and
his/her rights are values which must be protected. The behavior of every employee and
collaborator must be in conformity with the principles and regulations expressed in the
Ethics Code and the legal and contractual rules that regulate labor relations regulations.
By disseminating their own Ethics Code even to collaborators and suppliers the EI.En.
Group has established a safeguard aimed at guaranteeing the respect of human rights
(prohibition of discrimination, prohibition of forced or child labor, free association) even
in those areas that are held to be of the greatest potential risk in relation to these issues
(for example, the supply chain).

To increase awareness of these issues which are considered top priority, on November
14th, 2019 the Board of Directors of El.En. S.p.A. approved the Human Rights Policy
which will be extended to all the subsidiary companies.
