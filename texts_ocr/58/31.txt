4.2 Quality and safety of our products

The Group is aware that the complexity of its business requires high qualitative
standards and for this reason the commitment that we have and we promote for the
quality and safety of our products is essential in order to guarantee continued growth
and success. We have always focused on the phases of design and development
of our systems; in fact, our value is created through the study and application of
methods that are increasingly selective, effective and safe.

Every day we are committed to supplying products of
value to our clients in such a way as to create loyalty that
is based on quality, reliability and safety and to guarantee
these requirements for the product are recognized and
appreciated and that every measure be adopted to make
sure that they are in conformity with the law.

To this purpose, some companies of the Group have
equipped themselves with an Integrated Management
System Manual which is in compliance with TUSSL n. 81
of 2008, to describe the objectives and the policies of the
Management System for Quality and the ways in which
it should be applied. The manual defines the general
criteria needed to satisfy the requirements for safety and
performance of products during their entire life cycle, as
well as the services supplied.

ELEn. S.p.A., Deka M.E.L.A. S.rl., Quanta System S.p.A.,
ASA S.r.l. and Asclepion GmbH also use a Quality Policy
which guarantees the conformity of the activities to the
regulations of the institutions in the country in which
they operate.

Depending on the geographic area in which they are
located and the type of business they run, the different
companies of the Group comply with the standards and
regulations shown below.

+ — ISO 9001;

+ ISO 13485 relative to quality control systems for
medical devices

+ European directive MDD93/42/EEC (Medical Devices
Directive);

+ — National laws of the countries that are members of
EU and the non-European countries like the United
States of America(21CFR820/803/806), Japan, China
(CCC- Certification for electronic components and
Enterprise standard “CNC laser cutting machine”) and
Brazil.

ELEn. S.p.A., Deka Mela S.rl, Quanta System S.p.A,,
Asclepion GmbH and ASA S.r.|. in February 2020) obtained
the MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program)
certification. This certification allows institutions that are
recognized and accredited by the Regulatory Authorities
of the five member countries (U.S.A, Canada, Brazil,
Japan and Australia) to conduct a single audit at the
manufacturers of medical devices in order to verify that
these latter meet the requirements of the quality system
of the particular country. The objective of MDSAP is to
develop, manage and supervise a single audit program
which will make it possible to carry out a single regulatory
verification at the factories manufacturing medical devices,
conducted by a recognized institution MDSAP, which will
satisfy the requirements of many different jurisdictions.

In a highly competitive environment like that of the
medical industry, the competence of the experts working
in the sector of Regulatory Affairs is of significant
economic importance for the companies, especially when
these latter are pursuing goals of internationalization in

their marketing strategy. At the companies of the EI.En.

Group that operate in the medical sector the Regulatory
function registers the compliance to the requirements
of the government institutions which protect the public
health and monitor the safety and effectiveness of the
products produced in this sector. The companies that
manufacture medical devices guarantee that their
products are in compliance with all of the regulations
relating to safety.

For this reason it is strategic for the company to equip
itself with an office specialized in Regulatory Affairs so

that they can keep the products updated with respect to
the legislation, obtain and manage the certifications of
the product, and guarantee the continual maintenance
of conformity by acting as an intermediary between the
requirements of the authorities and the needs expressed
by all of the functional areas of the company, following
the bureaucratic procedure and making themselves
available in case that further documents or clarifications
are requested by the institutions.

The Regulatory Activity requires the presence of people
with different skills, possibly with different technical,
scientific and administrative experience as well as a
knowledge of different languages because it is necessary
to know not only the national regulations but those of
other European and extra-European countries.

         
       
       
 
  

Our products and our quality
systems are certified by the
most important institutions at a
world level that are responsible
for supervising the safety and
effectiveness, above all, of medical
devices. Our companies periodically
receive inspections for the renewal
of the certificates they possess,
and which are indispensable for
exporting our products abroad.
