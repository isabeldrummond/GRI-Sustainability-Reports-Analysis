The Group, moreover, is committed to sustaining
cultural, social and educational initiatives in favor of
the local community with the objective of strengthening
the relations with the surrounding area in which it
operates and with the people involved directly or

indirectly in the activities of the Group. The basic idea is
the promotion of a mutual, positive exchange between
the Group and the local community, which is beneficial
to both parties involved in the projects and activities
they develop.

 

The subsidiary DEKA Mela S.r.I. sponsors the football team and the training activity (civic
education) in the schools of “Onlus Amici di Duccio”. This association has the purpose of
creating awareness in people for donations which benefit disadvantaged categories especially
those that are victims of violence or social injustice. Moreover, they create awareness in the
institutions in order to see that due punishment is meted out to road killers, violence against
minors and women. In particular, the association wishes to honor the memory of Duccio Dini,

by creating and carrying out social projects.

 

The subsidiary DEKA Mela S.r.I. sponsors the championship of Lupi Toscani, wheelchair
hockey team from Scandicci (Florence) who plays in the A2 series.

 

The volunteers who spend their lunch break cleaning up the woods
have also “infected” their company: a group of employees of Quanta
System S.p.A. in fact has been working alongside the volunteer

association “Parte tutto Da noi”.

The company was pleased to support the activity of its workers
by purchasing telescopic grippers and gloves to facilitate the
collection of rubbish. This initiative soon went beyond the confines

 

of the company and involves the public administration, retailers,
representatives of local associations and other citizens of the community.

following activities:

« University internships, both curricular and extra-

curricular;

combining theoretical aspects with practical ones;
in begin to participate in the workplace already
starting in secondary school in order for them to
gain orientation in relation to future employment;

door initiatives for a reciprocal exchange between
the companies and recent graduates looking for
their first job.
