Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2019

 

1.3 Materiality matrix

The process of evaluation of the relevant topics was
conducted forthe firsttime in 2017 by means of ananalysis
of materiality made internally by the top management
which made it possible to identify the most significant
aspects related to economic, social and environmental

issues for the El.En. Group and for its stakeholders.

These topics, in fact, reflect the main impact generated
by the Group and by their activities and represent the
aspects which potentially could be able to influence the
evaluations made by their stakeholders.

Again in 2019, as we did last year, the materiality matrix
was updated by implementing the following activities:

interviews with top management whom we asked to
review or confirm their evaluations of the priorities
attributed to the topics in the preceding years;

submission of a questionnaire to the employees of
the Group! to whom we asked to assign a priority
to the topics which they believed were the most
significant;

analysis of the results obtained from both enquiries
integrated with a qualitative evaluation for the
purpose of considering the best practice for the
sector and the evolution of the relevant legislation,
which brought about the updating of every topic as
represented in the following matrix:

Occupational health and safety e@
Product quality and safety
Ethics, integrity and compliance @ @

Training and professional growth of @
the employees

Research, development @
and innovation

Economic and financial performance @

Customer satisfaction

Human rights and working conditions @ e

From the analysis 14 material topics emerged: in particular, with respect to last year, the topic “Customer satisfaction”
was considered material in line with the constant interest and efforts made by the organization for the aspects related
to the satisfaction of the client, whereas the issue related to “industrial relations” was not considered material.

"In 2019 the employees of some of the Italian and Chinese subsidiaries were involved; in 2018 the employees of the Parent Company and some
of the Italian subsidiaries and, as external stakeholders, we contacted the suppliers which were the most important in terms of purchases by

the Parent Company and one of the Italian subsidiaries.
