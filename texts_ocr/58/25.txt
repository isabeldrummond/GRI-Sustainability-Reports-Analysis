3.3 Internal controls system and risk management

In a context of continuous evolution, where sustainability issues of the company
activities, the fight against climate change, the protection of the environment and
the adoption of suitable policies for development have become of fundamental
importance, the efficient management of risks is a key factor which every company
must now evaluate with greater attention. For this purpose, the El.En Group has
defined a System of Internal Controls and Management of Risks which is composed
of specific rules and procedures in order to be able to evaluate the present trends
and the new challenges of the market and succeed in taking advantage of the
opportunities that arise by a careful management of all the related risks.

For ELEn. S.p.A. and the Group, whose objective is the
sustainability of the company activities over a mid
to long-term period and the creation of value in the
respect of external stakeholders, the system of internal
controls and risk management is understood to be
a series of methods of analysis of the procedures, the
functions and organizational structure and the relative
activities conducted in order to identify the main risks
for the company, the methods used for managing them
and the organization of the system for safeguarding
against them. The organization of an adequate system of
controls is meant to implement an efficient management
of the company, the safeguarding of the corporate assets,
the efficient management of the company processes,
the reliability of the information disseminated by the
Company both of a financial and non-financial nature,
as well as the respect of the laws, the regulations, the
company statutes and internal procedures. For the
purposes of building and developing an adequate
system for the management of risk management, the
Parent Company has defined their own system of internal
controls and risk management, first of all, in relation
to the process of disseminating financial information,
based on the CoSO Framework model, consistent with
international best practice The main characteristics of
the system of internal controls and risk management
are represented, on one hand by the regulations
and procedures and, on the other, by the bodies for
governance and control. The regulations are mainly
constituted by a series of general principles codified by
the Ethics Code; and, in the second place, by a series of
secondary procedures (like those in ex D. Lgs. 231/01,
L. 262/05, L. 81/09, internal regulations concerning the
treatment of confidential information, operations with
related parties, internal dealing, etc. which make it
possible to act within the reality of the company and to
implement the above mentioned principles of a general
nature. On the other hand, they conduct the control of
the observance of the rules and procedures on the basis
of the competencies and functions defined and assigned

by the Board of Directors to the different bodies at
various levels. The organization of the System of Internal
Controls and Risk Management is set up as follows:

the system of internal controls which is being used
