Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2019

 

Emergency COVID-19

By mid-January 2020 it had become clear that the Covid-19 epidemic with its epicenter in
Wuhan, where the subsidiary Penta-Chutian Laser (Wuhan) is located was spreading rapidly.
The Chinese government adopted drastic measures to contain the contagion and inhouse-
quarantine was imposed in all of the province of the cities Wuhan, Hubei and other provinces.
Limitations in the circulation of people and the lockdown of the city of Wuhan still remain, while
in some of the other provinces life is gradually returning to normal thanks to the substantial
reduction of the number of new patients. The impact on the activities of the Group has been
extremely significant and the three factories in China had to extend the closure and stop all
production. In the cities of Lin Yiand in Wenzhou activities started again in early March but very
slowly due to the difficulty of moving from one province to another. However, in Wuhan, where
most of our employees live, the city is still under quarantine. While lost capacity is starting to be
overtaken after losing a couple of months, the demand for the products will require more time
before returning to the levels expected for 2020.

Even in Italy the measures taken by the government have blocked all sales on Italian territory
but, despite all the difficulties, where it is possible and where it is allowed, with the maximum
considerations for the protection of the health and safety of the workers, production has
continued in order to satisfy the significant volume of orders coming from abroad. The
restrictions that have been imposed have caused the cancellation of all trade fair and congress
events involving the markets of the Group and have prohibited to travel abroad, that is part of
the usual marketing activities of the Group.

In consideration of the Covid-19 emergency which is catalyzing most of the resources
of the public health institutions, the Board of Directors which met on March 13th 2020,
voted to increase to 500 thousand Euros the funds that the Group allocates to Social
Responsibility, as part of the implementation of their sustainability policy. These
resources consist of technologies and contributions which will be used for specific activities
in support of Public Health.
