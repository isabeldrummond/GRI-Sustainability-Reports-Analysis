5.3 The conservation of the World's Artistic Heritage

The beauty of works of art is our legacy for future generations and it is our duty to
preserve it for them. We are proud to be the first company in the world to produce
laser created specifically for the restoration of works of art using the same technology
used for medicine and surgery. Whether we are dealing with works of art or with
medicine, the principle is the same: taking care of people, our works of art.

One of the flagship products made by the EI.En. Group
is represented by the small segment of restoration;
over the years the sensitivity of the Group towards the
conservation of works of art has continued to grow and
has inspired research aimed at making the most advanced
conservation technologies available for the restoration of
artistic masterpieces all over the world. The Group has
continued to experiment with new technologies that
can offer conservation processes that are increasingly
effective and respectful of the works of art.

In fact, lasers offer a solution which is effective, reliable
and safe for the conservation of the world's cultural
heritage and give new life to the masterpieces that
have left an indelible mark on the history of humanity.
Restoration with lasers respects the original surface and
the texture of the art work because, by using a non-
invasive procedure respecting the original structure
of the work this method makes it possible to remove
the patina that has formed over the centuries so that
the public can admire the works of art restored to their
original state.

Laser solutions offer restorers a highly technological
instrument which allows them to operate with complete
safety with significant advantages with respect to
mechanical and chemical methods commonly used. First
of all, the method is minimally invasive because there is
no physical contact with the surface on which they are
working and this allows them to operate on surfaces that
are extremely fragile or altered. The high level of control
allows the restorer to define the degree of cleaning that
he wishes to achieve (a high selectivity because the
layers to be removed are very dark and therefore absorb
a high percentage of laser light) and the operation is
very precise because it is possible to define the exact
area in which one wishes to work without affecting the
surrounding area.

Lasers have been used successfully on numerous
monuments and works of art both in Italy and the rest

74

of Europe; in particular we wish to mention the most
important ones where EI.En. lasers were used: the Milan
Cathedral, the Florence Cathedral, Ghiberti’s north
door and Door of Paradise on the Baptistery of St. John
in Florence, the sculptural group with the Rape of the
Sabine Women by Giambologna in Piazza della Signoria
in Florence, the bas-reliefs of the Holy Sepulcher in
Jerusalem, the cloister of the Cathedral of Oviedo, the
Leaning Tower and the Cathedral of Pisa.

Some of the most important examples of restoration
work conducted with our lasers in 2019 are listed below:

+ The removal of writing and graffiti on Ponte Vecchio
in Florence with a laser donated by the El.En. Group
last year to the "Gli angeli del Bello" (Angels of
Beauty), an association of volunteers whose mission
is to keep the city of Florence clean and bring the
monuments back to their original splendor.

+ The removal of grime on the walls of the Sala delle
Asse in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan which
brought to light Leonardo da Vinci's monochrome
fresco by using a laser technology to remove the
layers of lime paint;

+ On the occasion of the exhibition “Verrocchio, il
maestro di Leonardo” held in Palazzo Strozzi in
Florence, they displayed Verrocchio’s David which
had been cleaned with a laser to reveal the thin layer
of gold which Verrocchio had applied to the sandals,
the trim of the tunic, the hair and even the pupils of
the eyes of the David;

+ During restoration of the north facade of the
Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence,
lasers were used to clean some of the detailing;

+ The South door of the Baptistery in Florence by
Andrea Pisano was completely cleaned and can now
be admired in all of its renewed splendor in the Sala
del Paradiso in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo.
