The subsidiary ASA S.r.l. inaugurated their new company headquarters at the end of 2019.
Technology and sustainability were the recurrent themes in the construction of the new
building which was created with the precise intent of focusing on the well-being and health
of their people.

In the spirit of well-being and belonging, the new structure which contains production and
office areas, was planned applying new solutions in the arrangement of the spaces and the
choice of furnishings. The building which is already set up for a future enlargement, was born
from the necessity of adapting the company to its new needs and includes spaces specifically
designed for the training of clients and sales personnel as well as the technical staff and
the intelligent redistribution of functional areas in order to improve the quality of work and
the use of open space working areas which, thanks to the specific design of the furnishings
and the installation of sound-proof panels, guarantee both the privacy and acoustics which
promote teamwork. The shared area is also outfitted with several meeting rooms, a job island,
a snack bar, and a coffee break island with distributors of micro-filtered water in order to
reduce the use of plastic. Moreover, the entire building is climatized summer/winter by a high
Energy efficient heat pump with a distribution system with micro-perforated conduits which
make it possible to distribute the air and the temperature without using ventilation.

The structure was designed to facilitate the entire production line; the flow is planned so as to
optimize the management of the operations developed according to the standards of “lean
manufacturing” which, when correctly integrated into the layout, offer benefits in terms of
organization, crossing time, movement of merchandise and safety in the workplace.

Moreover, during the selection of the building site for the construction of the new factory
we also took into consideration the fact that we had found a construction site that was right
next to the preceding one and this fact would avoid creating inconvenient for the staff by not
interrupting their routine or creating difficulty in coming to and from work.. Maintaining the
well-being of the personnel was the top priority of the management and from the earliest
phases of this project they took into consideration the needs of the staff.

On the occasion of the inauguration of the new ASA factory, the parent company, EI.En.
donated a DAE semi-automatic external defibrillator (there are already two of them in the
factory at Calenzano), thus making the company cardio-protected and ready for the use of
this valuable instrument which is of vital importance for the health of those who suddenly are
facing critical situations.
