7.2 Emissions

The direct and indirect CO, emissions associated with the In particular, for the calculation of CO2, emissions, as
main consumption of the Group can be divided into two stated in the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards,
categories: one must use the calculation of Scope 2 according to
two distinct calculation methods: the “Location-based
method” and the “Market-based method”. The Location-
based method is based on the factors of relative
emissions related to the generation of regional, sub-
national and national energy.

¢ Direct emissions (Scope 1): emissions of green-
house gases due to direct consumption of fuel by
the Group (for example, natural gas and diesel fuel);

« Indirect emissions (Scope 2): emissions of green-
house gases derived from the consumption of
electrical energy purchased and used by the Group.

° After the refinement of the monitoring system of the consumption of electrical Energy by the Chinese companies of the Group, the relevant data for
2018 were revised with respect to those published in the last non financial document. For this data, please consult the 2018 DNF which was published
on the site of www.elengroup.com. In the sector Investor Relations / Sustainability/ Reports.

7The data related to the consumption of electrical energy in the month of December 2019, unless otherwise specified, were acquired from the invoices
issued by the suppliers of energy services. The data related to energy consumption by the companies located in Calenzano were in part estimated
on the basis of the consumption in the month of December 2018. The consumption of fuel for vehicles for the automobiles belonging to the Italian
companies located in Calenzano and part of those related to Lasit S.p.A., were estimated on the basis of the costs by means of the average annual price
of gas and diesel fuel (Euros per liter) shown on the site of the Ministry for Economic Development. For automobiles with mixed use, we considered
70% of the total consumption. For the calculation of Energy consumption in GJ, we used the conversion factors of the Department for Environmental
Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), UK, for 2019 and for 2018".

® After the refinement of the monitoring system of the gas consumption of the company automobiles owned by the Chinese companies of the Group,

the data related to 2018 were revised with respect to those published in the preceding non-financial document. For the preceding data, please consult
NFD 2018 which was published on the site www.elengroup.com. in the section Investor Relations / Sustainability/ Reports.

The Market-based energy, on the other hand, is based on
the CO2 emissions by the energy supplier from whom
the organization, by means of a contract, buys their
energy or on factors related to the specific market'®.

To calculate the Scope2 emissions we used different
factors based on the method of calculation and the
country. In particular:

+ For the location-based method we used average emission
factors that are related to the generation of national energy
for the different countries in which we operate as shown in
the publication titled Confronti Internazionali, Terna 2016
and 2017, respectively for 2018 and 2019";

+ For the market-based method we have used average
emission factors derived from the electricity production

of the European market for Italy, France and Germany,
which were published in the document Residual Mix
Results, Association of issuing bodies (AIB), 2017 and 2018,
respectively for 2018 and 2019. For the other countries, we
have used the same factors used for the location-based
method.

For 2019, considering the calculation method location
based for Scope 2, the total emissions were 3.703 tCO,,,.
49% can be attributed to the consumption of electricity
while 51% is due to other factors.

For the calculation of indirect emissions using the market-
based method, CO2,, emissions were in line with those
shown above, i.e. for a total of 4.222 tons of direct and
indirect emissions of C02...

°Further details concerning the method used for the calculation of the emissions and the emission factors used, please see the relative section in

the chapter on Performance Indicators.

'° As a result of the refinement of the monitoring system of electrical energy and gas for the company cars of the Chinese subsidiaries of the Group,
the data for 2018 for the geographic area called “Rest of the World” have been revised with respect to those published in the preceding NFD. For
these data, please consult the NFD, published on the site www.elengroup.com. in the section Investor Relations / Sostainability/Reports.

"It should be noted that the Scope 2 emissions calculated with the emission factors published by Terna in the International Comparisons document

are expressed in tons of CO,; in any case, the percentage of methane and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on the total emissions of greenhouse
gas (CO,,,.), as can be seen from the specific technical literature.
