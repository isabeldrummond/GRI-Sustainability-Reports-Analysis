4.1 Research & Development as an instrument for

innovation

The critical factors in the success of the El.En. Group are the adequacy of the range of
products which we offer and the capacity to innovate it continually in order to meet

the requirements of the market and create new ones.

The position of the Group for hi-tech products and the
global competitive context in which it operates comports
a continuous and significant effort in terms of research
and development of new products and new technologies;
our strong point is the capacity to be single minded, to
innovate considering the requirements of the doctor and
the patient in the medical sector rather than the client in
the industrial sector, starting with every intuition which
may arise from the close and constant observation of
problems that have not yet been solved.

The skills that have been developed and the enthusiasm
of our staff are the real difference. The El.En Group and
the people who work there in fact, have a knowledge of
physical, biomedical and technological phenomena that
has matured in over thirty years of experience, which
has brought them to have an extraordinary capacity to
improve their own know-how, to innovate the production
technologies, processes products and related services.
The Group organizes its activity of research and

58

development according to mid- to long-term programs in
order to prepare quickly and continuously products that
are innovative in their performance and applications.

In our research activities conducted in our laboratories,
as well as that made in collaboration with important
research centers, hospitals and universities, both at a
national and international level, we set no limits since we
are driven by the desire and the passion for everything
that is new or can become new. The kind of research
that is conducted is of the applied type for most of the
activities while it is theoretical for some specific subjects,
usually related to activities regarding mid- to long-term
innovative objectives.

Theinnovating capacity of the El.En.Group is demonstrated
by the number of patents that the Group has obtained: in
less than forty years of activity since its foundation 127
patents have been obtained and 23 are pending.

The chart below shows the expenses sustained by the
Group during 2019 for research and development:

DUE eels ged 31/12/2018 31/12/2019
Staff costs and general expenses 9,995 11,145
Equipment 197 310
Costs for testing and prototypes 5,404 2,783
Consultancy fees 522 574
Other services 99 201
Total costs R&D 16,218 15,014

 

 

 

 

 

The amount of the costs sustained corresponds to about
4% of the sales volume of the Group. The expenses
sustained by El.En. S.p.A. are about 6% of its revenues.

The following list shows the main directives of medical
research and development conducted by the Group:

+ Development of new laser systems and improvement
of pre-existing ones with emission of impulses
with a duration in picoseconds, for dermatological
applications;

+ Preliminary study, development and_ planning
of systems that integrate and improve existing
laser applications for hair removal, as well as the
improvement of the related accessories and their
performance;

+ Research activity and clinical experimentation of
the effects of laser application to biological tissues
including laboratory studies of biological samples
and cellular cultures; experiments on laser emissions
with wave lengths for which the theoretical models
promise particular effectiveness in the treatment of
some skin pathologies or in general, of the human
body;

+ Consolidation of the development of a new system
based on microwaves as a highly effective form of
energy for the reduction of the layer of subcutaneous

fat in various parts of the body by means of a
non-invasive treatment (the ONDA system which
was released for sale in 2018; the technology was
patented and during 2019 received FDA clearance).
Preliminary study, development and planning of a
multifunctional platform for dermatological and
aesthetic applications, amplifying the range of
accessories available (this is the LUXEA platform
which received FDA clearance in 2019);
Continuation of the studies undertaken in order
to confirm the anti-inflammatory action, the
accelerated healing of surgical wounds, the
analgesic effect as well as the improvement of the
limbs thanks to the use of lasers in physical therapy.;
Study, development and planning of systems based
on high-powered holmium technology as well as
the technological renovation of the mid-powered
system for the treatment of urinary tract stones and
benign hyperplasia of the prostate, as well as a new,
precise and innovative laser with combined wave
length for surgical applications.

Continuation of the development and innovation
activities in dermatology for the segment dedicated
to the removal of tattoos and the treatment of
cutaneous and dermatological lesions in general;
Development of systems with combined LED
technologies with electro-stimulation for the
reduction of adipose layers.
