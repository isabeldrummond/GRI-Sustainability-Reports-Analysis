Environmental matters

The Group pays attention to the responsible management
of its activities, seeking a balance between economic
objectives and indispensable environmental requirements.
On November 14th 2019 the Board of Directors of
El.En. S.p.A. approved their first “Environmental Policy”

companies will also approve this policy.

Respect for human rights

The Group protects human rights through the adoption
and dissemination of the Ethics Code which requires
conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights issued by the United Nations and requires that
it be respected also by its main suppliers. In particular,
the Parent Company requires compliance with the Ethics
Code by their consultants, distributors, agents and
suppliers of critical components. On November 14th
2019, the Board of Directors of El.En. S.p.A. approved their
first “Human Rights Policy” respecting the commitment
they had made as part of the Sustainability Plan. In
2020 the subsidiary companies will also approve the
Policy. Specific training courses regarding this topic are
planned, especially in those countries where legislation
on this subject is not as rigorous as it is in Italy.

The fight against active and passive corruption

This subject is regulated by the Ethics Code of the Group to
which all subsidiaries, associated companies and the main
suppliers must comply. Moreover, the subject is overseen
by the Parent Company and its subsidiaries Deka M.E.LA.
S.rl. and Quanta System S.p.A. through the Organizational
Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001 On
November 14th 2019, the Board of Directors of El.En. S.p.A.
approved their first “Anti-corruption Policy” respecting the
commitment they had made in the Sustainability Plan. In
2020 the subsidiary companies will also approve this Policy.

Social matters

The Group has always paid particular attention to
the quality and safety of its products and, to this aim,

the main manufacturing companies of the Group
have adopted a quality control system and obtained
certification ISO 9001" and ISO 13485" related to the
quality control systems or medical devices. Moreover, the
Group bases its critical success factors also on its capacity
for innovation, as demonstrated by the investments in
research and development which have the objective of
creating innovative systems and applications to meet the
needs of customers and create new ones.

Employee-related matters

In the Ethics Code the Group has codified their
commitment to respect and protect the dignity, the
health, the safety and the privacy of their employees and
collaborators. Moreover, as part of the quality control
system (ISO 9001) adopted by the main manufacturing
companies of the Group, the certified companies
safeguard the aspects related to the management of
the employees. In particular, the Parent Company has
conducted a codification of the procedures for the
management of human resources as well as a profiling of
the company functions with a detailed description of the
necessary responsibilities and skills.

Supply chain matters

As stated in the Ethics Code, the Group sets as one of
its objectives that of creating relationships with their
suppliers that are based on standards of transparency
and correctness. In consideration of the renewed and
growing interest of the organization in issues related
to the supply chain, as mentioned in the materiality
analysis, the Group is committed to taking action with
their suppliers in order to define and share the principles
of social and environmental good practice and ethical
behaviour intended to promote a responsible and
sustainable supply chain: the commitment is that of
extending these aspects of the Ethics Code by the end
of 2020, instead of in a specific Behaviour Code as was
earlier planned. The Group has started to add to the
process of qualification, selection and evaluation of the
suppliers in Italy and abroad, a checklist of environmental
and social criteria to evaluate all potential new suppliers.
Moreover, the company is committed to formalize the
reporting process for non-financial information as part
of a procedure which defines roles, responsibilities and
deadlines.
