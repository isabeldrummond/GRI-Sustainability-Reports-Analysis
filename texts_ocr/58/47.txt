In early 2019 the company has opened new premises dedicated to the well-being of the
employees at the companies located in Calenzano. This new space covers an area of 500 mq,
and has state-of-the-art machines and equipment for exercising and an indoor playground
for games between two to four basketball and/or football players. The gym is decorated with
murals painted by a famous Florentine street artist which represent the connection between
Florence, technology and the future where the human component is always the element of
continuity and union.

In fact, this multi-purpose area has been created at El.En. with an aim to promoting and
valuing human relations, participation and sharing. This initiative is part of a program for
the development of the well-being of the over 300 employees of the company who work
in Calenzano. All of these activities improve the quality of the working environment in the
company and are part of a broader plan which the Company started a few years ago for
their employees which has as its ultimate goal taking care of their people in every aspect
of their lives. It is increasingly important to combine each professional figure’s training and
career path with investments that lead to the creation of an energetic and fulfilling work
environment which stimulates teamwork.

and connected to it; the new three-storey building offers increased space for the offices of
over fifty employees, new manufacturing and storage areas as well as a cleanroom, a zone
dedicated to technical assistance and a modern center for training clients; the meeting hall

three rooms which can be used for demonstrations of the treatments, each one with its own
