The main types of training courses promoted by the Group

+ Training on health and safety issues, related to
learning and up-dating of the regulations required

and safety in the workplace.

control system in order to learn the operative

skills necessary to carry out the task that has been
assigned;

¢ Linguistic training in order to increase the linguistic
skills of the resources involved;

necessary to be competent in the use of computers
(for example, knowledge of some types of software);

+ Training for newly hired employees;

¢ On the job training usually conducted for a specific

period in the company by other qualified employees.
Although the training courses are not centrally
coordinated they are defined annually by each company
and besides the obligatory training that must be offered,

they make a note of the specific issues which need to be
dealt with and, in some of the companies, the employees
may request to participate in specific training courses to
enrich and personalize their curriculum.

In order to promote a greater sense of responsibility in
all of the employees, this year the Parent Company and
some of the subsidiaries have organized training and
information activities on the Organizational Model and
on the administrative responsibilities of legal persons
in conformity with ex D.Lgs. 231, as well as on the issues
related to sustainability and the relative Sustainability Plan
of the El.En. Group.

Despite the fact that at this time in the Group there is
no training activity related to Human Rights, in 2019 the
Group adopted a Human Rights Policy and is committed
to the spread and application of the Ethics Code which
contains the principles of legality, loyalty, correctness,
transparency and professionalism to which every person
in the Group must adhere; in the main Italian companies
the Ethics Code is given to all new employees as soon
as they are hired as part of the required documentation
whereas at the subsidiaries Asclepion GmbH, Quanta
System S.p.A. and the Chinese subsidiaries a special focus
on the Ethics Code is part of the training session for new
employees.

Competencies’, “Strategy Innovation Sources’, “Strategy Innovation Tools” and “Strategy

Innovation Project Work”.

VS MORE THAN 2.000 HOURS OF SPECIFIC TRAINING ON HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES

 

47% THE DECREASE OF THE INJURY RATE COMPARED TO 2018

 

As stated in the Ethics Code, the El.En. Group is committed
to the dissemination and consolidation of a culture of
safety by promoting responsible behavior on the part
of all of its collaborators. For this purpose the Group is
committed to:

+ Always acting in conformity with national and
international standards;

+ Managing dangers and risks related to very task and
every activity; every variation in the organizational
layout at every level, comports an up-date of the
relative documentation;

+ Supplying competence and awareness of the risks
related to the environment and to the tasks through
continuous information and training;

+ Periodic revision of the procedures and the work
safety instructions in order to modify and improve
them;

+ Adoption of good practices in the management of

contracts and sub-contracts in order to reduce the
risk of interference;

+ Search for the best technology available for the
protection of the individual and the collectivity.

In all of the manufacturing companies of the Group

the issue of health and safety is monitored by processes

which, although they are not centralized and coordinated
at a Group level, guarantee in each subsidiary that there
are procedures related to the protection of the health
and safety of the workers and the implementation of
actions for their correction or improvement.

In the Italian companies this issue if regulated by D.Lgl.
81/2008; also, the manufacturing companies monitor
health and safety on the basis of the local laws. The Italian
companies of the Group have also analyzed the issue
of health and safety in relation to the Organizational
level in compliance with D.lgs 231/2001. The principle
that is followed is that the policy of safety should be
raised to a corporate level like all the other values that
characterize the strategy of the Company. Just as we
make use of organizational systems for the management
of economic resources, in the same manner, safety
must represent an essential value which must be
protected and implemented constantly, with the help
of an organizational system which is able to identify
the instruments, the responsibilities and the direct
motivation and to express the commitment of the top
management in relation to this subject.

From this, the commitment to the respect of the
regulations related to health and safety in the
Organizational Model are derived,
