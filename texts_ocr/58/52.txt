7.3 Water consumption

The efforts of the Group to respect and optimize the
environmental resources are evident also in their
efficient use of water, with the objective of keeping
consumption to a minimum and reduce waste, in a
moment in which water represents a precious resource
that is at risk for future generations.

The Group is committed to promoting correct habits
regarding the saving of water and they have given
practical advice to their employees and implemented
improvements in this sense (for example, closing the
tap when the water is not being used so as to avoid the
phenomenon of "running water", etc).

Water is mainly used for washing and other sanitation

needs, for the company canteen and for production
processes. In this latter case, water is usually used in
closed circuits which means that it can be recycled and
not dispersed into the environment.

In 2019, the amount of water consumed was 38.161 m?

and it came exclusively from the municipal aqueduct.

The increase in water consumption, like the increase in
Energy consumption, was due mainly to the expansion
and transfer of some of the subsidiary companies (Cutlite
Penta S.rl., Ot-las S.rl, ASA S.rl. and Asclepion Laser
Technology GmbH) to new, larger factories which made
it possible for them to increase production and hire new
personnel, with a consequent increase in consumption.
