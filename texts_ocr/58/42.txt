6. The people

EI.En. firmly believes that human resources constitute the most important asset
of the Company. The ability to innovate and to pursue excellence depends on the
people and the collaborators involved in all of the activities and the result of the
specialization, the competence and the passion that distinguish all the people who

work for the Group.

For El.En. people come first because it is only through the
growth of the individual that ideas and skills become a
common factor and, though exchange and collaboration
contribute to the collective growth of the Group and the
creation of a shared value. In the Ethics Code of the Group,
EL.En. has codified their commitment to the respect and
protection of the dignity, the health, safety and privacy of

its employees and collaborators. In particular, the Group
aims at the protection of the physical and moral integrity
of its workers by informing them of their rights and of
the risks that they might face in the performance of their
work, and guaranteeing working conditions that respect
the dignity of the individual in conformity with the laws

and the regulations that are now in force.

The concern for human resources is an issue of great
relevance also in the field of quality management which
most of the manufacturing companies of the Group have
adopted in conformity to regulation ISO 9001. On the
basis of this regulation, in fact, the certified companies
have been supervising certain issues like the selection,
training, and development of skilled personnel and the
definition of the responsibilities for the various functions.

The Parent Company, in particular, has conducted an
analysis for the codification of management procedures
for human resources (hiring, remuneration, etc.) as well
as the profiling of the corporate functions with the
identification of the responsibilities and skills that are
necessary. On the basis of this, we have planned ad hoc
training courses to respond to the training needs of each one.
In the Group there are 1.498 employees and together we
form an international Group that is growing and that is

called to operate in contexts that are very different on a
global level; ours is, in fact a multicultural team: of 100
people in the El.En. Group, 45 work in Italy, 39 in China,
10 in Germany and the remaining are distributed among
Japan, Brazil and France.

The diversity of our people is evident in the statistics:

+ The El.En. staff is, for the most part, young, in the age
range from 30 to 50 years of age (61%), with 26%
of the employees being under 30 years of age, and
13% over 50.

+ The work force is represented by 24% women, a
percentage which reaches 31% if one considers
just the white-collar employees; the manufacturing
nature of the activities of the Group, in fact,
determines the prevalence of men in the category
of laborers.
