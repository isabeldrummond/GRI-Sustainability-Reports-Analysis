Deloitte.

Our auditing firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly,
maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.

Auditor's responsibility

Our responsibility is to express our conclusion based on the procedures performed about the compliance of
the NFS with the Decree and the GRI Standards. We conducted our work in accordance with the criteria
established in the “International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) - Assurance
Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (hereinafter “ISAE 3000
Revised”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited
assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited
assurance whether the NFS is free from material misstatement. Therefore, the procedures performed ina
limited assurance engagement are less than those performed in a reasonable assurance engagement in
accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, therefore, do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would
become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable assurance
engagement.

The procedures performed on NFS are based on our professional judgement and included inquiries,
primarily with company personnel responsible for the preparation of information included in the NFS,
analysis of documents, recalculations and other procedures aimed to obtain evidence as appropriate.

Specifically we carried out the following procedures:

1. Analysis of relevant topics with reference to the Group’s activities and characteristics disclosed in the
NFS, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process in place in light of the provisions of
art. 3 of the Decree and taking into account the adopted reporting standard.

2. Analysis and assessment of the identification criteria of the consolidation area, in order to assess its
compliance with the Decree.

3. Comparison between the financial data and information included in the NFS with those included in the
consolidated financial statements of the El.En. Group.

4. Understanding of the following matters:

e business management model of the Group’s activities, with reference to the management of the
topics specified by article 3 of the Decree;

e policies adopted by the entity in connection with the topics specified by article 3 of the Decree,
achieved results and related fundamental performance indicators;

e main risks, generated and/or undertaken, in connection with the topics specified by article 3 of the
Decree.

Moreover, with reference to these matters, we carried out a comparison with the information contained
in the NFS and the verifications described in the subsequent point 5, letter a).

5. Understanding of the processes underlying the origination, recording and management of qualitative and
quantitative material information included in the NFS.

In particular, we carried out interviews and discussions with the management of El.En. S.p.A. and with
the employees of Cutlite Penta S.r.I., Penta-Chutian Laser (Wuhuan) Co. Ltd and Penta-Laser Equipment
Wenzhou Co. Ltd and we carried out limited documentary verifications, in order to gather information
about the processes and procedures which support the collection, aggregation, elaboration and

transmittal of non-financial data and information to the department responsible for the preparation of
the NFS.

In addition, for material information, taking into consideration the Group’s activities and characteristics:

at the parent company’s and subsidiaries’ level:

a) with regards to qualitative information included in the NFS, and specifically with reference to the
business management model, policies applied and main risks, we carried out interviews and
gathered supporting documentation in order to verify its consistency with the available evidence;

b) with regards to quantitative information, we carried out both analytical procedures and limited
verifications in order to ensure, on a sample basis, the correct aggregation of data.

for the following companies and sites, Calenzano headquarters for El.En. S.p.A., Prato headquarters
and production site for Cutlite Penta S.r.l. and Wenzhou headquarters and production site for Penta-
Laser Equipment Wenzhou Co. Ltd, which we selected based on their activities, their contribution to
the performance indicators at the consolidated level and their location, we carried out visits on site,
during which we have met their management and have gathered supporting documentation with
reference to the correct application of procedures and calculation methods used for the indicators.

Conclusion

Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of
the El.En. Group as of December 31, 2019 is not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with
articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI Standards.
