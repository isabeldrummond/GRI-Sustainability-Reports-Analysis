Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2019

 

with an aim to promote a significant reduction
in workplace accidents; the recognition that the
responsibility for the management of safety regards
the entire company from the employer to the each
individual worker, on the basis of his tasks and skills; the
commitment to assign adequate human and financial
resources towards the objective of reducing accidents
and that of constantly improving working conditions,
and the promise that workers will be adequately
informed and trained in relation to the risk connected
with the processes.

On the basis of the Organizational model the
following measures are planned the identifying and
locating, among the various company functions, the
responsibilities connected with the issues of health and
safety, the mapping and self-evaluation of risks, the
implementation of training programs.

For the companies located in the area of Calenzano, the
central role of the HSE office in the management of safety
has, over time, given us a more consistent and uniform
vision of the company policies in relation to this issue.

In all of the manufacturing companies there is a
plan for a procedure for identifying risks related to
safety and health of the workers: in Italy this activity is
codified in the Risk Evaluation Document (DVR); in the
Chinese companies the risks related to the workplace

are formalized and communicated to the workers by
means of the "Worker's Manual"; also in the German
and Brazilian subsidiaries, the analysis of the risks is
formalized is specific documents which are periodically
up-dated. The identification of the risks precedes the
identification and implementation of the corrective
and/or preventive actions. Most of the subsidiaries have
adopted a procedure for reporting of risks by workers
and they have elected safety representatives among the
workers.

During this year the Italian companies of the Group held
periodic meetings in conformity with art.35 of D.Lgs.
81/08, in which the employer, the company doctor, the
RSPP (Manager of Prevention and Protection Services)
and the RSL (Workers' Safety Representative) attend and
represent all of the workers. In line with a policy of the
greatest transparency, in the periodic meeting of the
Parent Company a member of the Supervising body is
invited to participate as well as all of the persons who are
members of the company safety staff.

During the meeting the following subjects are discussed:
- up-dating of any modifications to be made to the risk
evaluation document;

- evaluation of the trend in the number of accidents,
professional diseases and health supervision;

- selection criteria, technical characteristics, and
effectiveness of the individual protective devices which
have been added or modified;

- safety information and training programs for executives,
managers and workers.

During each meeting a new, improved safety program
is explained, in which they describe all of the objectives
that the Prevention and Protection Services have set to
achieve the next year.

The German and Brazilian companies also have specific
commissions dealing with health and safety which meet
periodically to evaluate the management of these issues.

For the Brazilian company, the health and safety
representatives of the workers meet once a month to
monitor the situation.

Inallofthe production companies there are representatives
that are responsible for safety and health issues (for
example, the employer, the RSPP and managers for the
Italian companies, the general manager or department
manager for the Chinese companies, the employer and
the safety manager for the German companies).

In all of the production companies there are training and
information programs regarding health and safety both
at the start of employment and later, at regular intervals.
The structure and type of training courses is defined by
the individual companies but, in general, all of them have
programs with training for generic risks as well as those
with risks connected to specific types of work, first-aid
courses and periodic up-dating courses.

In 2019 health and safety training courses at a Group
level were conducted for a total of 2.043 hours, a
decrease compared to last year due to the periodicity of
compulsory training by law.

Considering the type of production activity that
is conducted, all of the companies have set safety
procedures and individual and collective protection
devices for the risks that are connected to artificial
optical radiation.

In particular, all those involved in production have
individual protections and, in a different manner, there
are devices for individual or collective prevention like
barriers, container boxes and turn-styles to delimit the
production areas. The issue of safety is also monitored
in the non-manufacturing companies by means of the
collection and monitoring of data related to accidents.

At a Group level in 2019 they registered 16 accidents
in the workplace, a sharp decrease compared to the 29
registered in the previous year; in any case, considering
the number of new employees that was registered the
accident rateâ€™ showed a drop and decreased from 11,4
to 6,3. The main types of accidents were lesions and
contusions, mostly to the arms and legs. During this
year so far no serious accidents or deaths have occurred.
When an accident occurs the companies conduct an
investigation to determine the cause and take new or
improved preventive measures.

5 The injury rate was calculated as the ratio between the total number of injuries and the total number of working hours, using the multiplying

factor of 1.000.000.
