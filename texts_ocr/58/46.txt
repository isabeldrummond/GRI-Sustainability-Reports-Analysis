Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2019

 

The welfare of our people is a key factor in the success of the Company. In fact,
technical skills are not enough to guarantee a good result; it is necessary for the
company to offer its employees an environment that can stimulate their potential

and their ability.

To support, promote and implement the welfare of our
people the El.En. Group considers welfare an innovative
instrument with respect to the traditional types of
remuneration and incentive and it is destined to become
an integral part of a modern and efficient management
of resources.

Welfare programs are now planned by the Japanese
subsidiary and two of the Chinese subsidiaries. In
compliance with the CCNL for the sector which we apply,
the Italian companies of the Group issue a part of the
salary for flexible benefits. In particular, for the companies
located in and around the Headquarters in Calenzano
and Prato, by using a specific platform, every worker can
choose the befit or welfare service most suited to his/her
needs like, for example, the costs of home care or health
services reimbursement of school expenses, additional
pension, training courses, recreational benefits, goods in
kind, or collective transportation services.

Moreover, on the basis of a company agreement which
was stipulated a few months ago, it will be possible to
convert up to 50% of the amount due to the workers
as a result bonus into welfare benefits and/or services.

With this agreement, the companies have also granted
an improvement in the treatment with respect to the
present ones offered by the CCNL by guaranteeing
an extra day of paid leave for the birth of a child with
respect to the present regulations and also the first three
days of a sick leave which lasts less than five days will
be paid 100% even after the third time. In the second
level agreement, the subsidiary Quanta System S.p.A.
introduced the possibility for every employee to convert
the entire production premium into welfare.

As determined by collective bargaining the Italian
companies adhere to health care funds for all of their
employees.

For the employees of the companies in Calenzano and in
Prato, the Group has always offered free canteen service
while the subsidiary Quanta System S.p.A. has its own
gym which is available to all of the workers.

Environments dedicated to employee well-being have
been installed at the companies with headquarters in
Calenzano and for the subsidiaries Asclepion and Asa.
Details are described below.
