1. Sustainability
1.1 Sustainability for the El.En. Group

Sustainability means creating value over time and being ready to accept and
successfully deal with the challenges for tomorrow; in the light of the development
of the context to which we are referring and moved by the desire to communicate
our commitment, we have undertaken a program of sustainability that is more
detailed because we have always believed that the respect of the law, the
protection of employment, the correct use of human resources and the defense of
the environment, the research and development and the quality of our products,
as well as the safeguarding of the interests and creation of value for all of our
stakeholders are the only pathway that can be followed by a company that is

innovative, sustainable and successful.

The principles of sustainability for the El.En. Group are
not an abstract concept but have always represented
the basis for the development and growth that have
characterized the Group over the years and are the
demonstration that value is created through responsible
management which respects the economic, social and
environmental equilibrium.

The Group adopted this policy in a structured form only
two years ago but they rapidly acquired the necessary
awareness and were able to quickly define the activities
that had to be carried out. This was due to the fact that
the problems that had to be dealt with and the aspects
that required reporting were already part of their cultural
background and the drafting of this document is the
demonstration that, besides the economic results, the
performance of the Group has always achieved excellent
results on environmental, social and governance issues.

Last year was an important year for the company in terms
of the definition of their commitment in relation to ESG
issues. We drafted and approved a five-year Sustainability
Plan and we defined a central coordinating unit and local

In 2019 El.En. was classified second among corporations quoted on

focal points for managing the flow of information from
the subsidiary companies.

During the present year the objective has been that of
increasing awareness of the impact and the importance
of the sustainability issues which have already been
defined and we have worked to spread the goals of the
Sustainability Plan and the activities required in order to
reach them. Our desire to integrate sustainability issues
last year convinced the Board of Directors of the Parent
Company EI.En. S.p.A. to entrust the Committee for
Controls and Risks with the task of examining the Group
policies and the objectives related to sustainability issues
and the supervision of the relative Plan.

In early 2020 in order to operate in a more responsible
and efficient manner, we decided to entrust the
Managing Director of the internal controls system with
the task of defining the basic strategy of sustainability,
the Sustainability Plan and the examination of the
Consolidated Non-financial Declaration so as to further
guarantee an adequate safe-guarding and monitoring of
the processes.

and on society.

Again this year, in order to gather and evaluate the
expectations and the issues of major interest for the
stakeholders we have conducted specific activities
related to stakeholder engagement: we submitted
a questionnaire to a selected sample of internal
stakeholders (employees of some of the subsidiary
companies). This process will be continued for the

next few years by submitting questionnaires to other
categories of stakeholders which have not yet been
interviewed, conducting an analysis of the market and
implementing other means of communication.

In the paragraphs below we will describe the methods
used and our main channels of communication and
dialogue with the stakeholders of the Group:
