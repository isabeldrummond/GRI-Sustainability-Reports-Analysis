7. Environmental responsibility

For the Group, the environment represents a primary asset
which must be protected. To this purpose the activities
that have been planned are aimed at finding a balance
between the economic objectives and the requirements
of the environment in order to respect and protect the
rights of future generations in line with the principles of
sustainable development. The Group is committed to the
monitoring of the environmental impact generated by

7.1 Energy consumption

The Group undertakes to reduce its energy consumption
through, where possible, improvements to processes
and infrastructures and the promotion of energy saving
behaviors and habits, promoting the development of an
environmental awareness among people.

The energy consumption of the Group consists of electrical
energy used for the heating or air conditioning of the
rooms and for the manufacturing processes; natural gas
and LPG used as fuel for the heating of the buildings, gas
and bioethanol used for the motor vehicles.

In particular, in 2019, 298.799 m3 of natural gas were used
and 5.770 liters of LPG. The total consumption of electrical
energy purchased was 4.675.659 kWh and a total of
461.219 liters of gas and diesel fuel were consumed. The
quantity of bioethanol consumed was 23.745 liters. The
overall consumption of Energy was therefore 44.559 GJ.

its activities as well as the prevention of potential risks
which may rise in this regard by implementing corrective
measures which respect the present regulations and best
practice on this issue.

In 2019 the Parent Company adopted an Environmental
Policy with which they became committed to controlling
and reducing the environmental impact of their activities.

In percentage terms, about 38% of the consumption was
for electricity and another 38% about was for the use of
company cars while about 24% was for natural gas and
LPG for the heating of buildings. During 2019, moreover,
the Group did not make use of energy from renewable
sources certified by guarantees of origin.

The overall Energy consumption showed an increase with
respect to those registered for 2018 (+10%). This is mainly
due to the expansion or transfer of some of the subsidiary
companies (Cutlite Penta S.rl., Ot-las S.rl, ASA S.rl. and
Asclepion Laser Technology Gmbh) to new larger premises
which allowed them to increase production and hire
new employees which gave rise to an increase in energy
consumption. Moreover, there was also an increase of 14%
in the consumption for the use of company vehicles.

Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2019

 

 

During 2019 the companies belonging to the El.En Group implemented many improvements
while completely respecting the identity and the philosophy of the Group and directing all of
their decisions towards the safe-guarding of the environment and the creation of sustainable
value for the planet and for people.

For the new company Headquarters of the subsidiary ASA S.r.l. it has been determined
that the quality of the design and construction of the building will enable them to avoid
the emission into the atmosphere of about 14,7 tons of CO, every year. Moreover they have
installed a plant for the treatment of the air which expels exhaust an inhales clean air from the
outside. This plant will make it possible to achieve the maximum efficiency of energy which is
guaranteed also by an exchanger which uses the heat of the exhaust to compensate for the
temperature of the air that is entering.

The design of the lighting system was based on high-efficiency LED technology and a 33 kW
photovoltaic plant has been installed in order to integrate the energy needs of the company
plants and the availability of a recharging area for the electric vehicles. Moreover, the Summer/
Winter air conditioning in all of the building is guaranteed by a high-performance heat
pump with micro-perforated conduits which distribute the air and the temperature without
ventilation.

During the expansion of the company headquarters of Asclepion GmbH they also installed a
photovoltaic plant which is estimated to produce 44 kW of power and which is estimated will
produce the energy requirements of the company for about a month and a half.

In Quanta System S.p.A. the cogeneration plant which now exists in 2019 produced an amount
of energy equivalent to 32% of that which is used overall by the company; in order to further
reduce the consumption this year they installed timer systems and motion sensors for the
lighting of the rooms.

 

2019: Beginning of the PLASTIC FREE era

 

At the headquarters of El.En. S.p.A. e ASA S.r.l.

they have installed stations with filtered water
in order to reduce the use of plastic bottles, which

also means less CO, released into the atmosphere.

During the inauguration of the new Asclepion

GmbH factory all of the employees were given a Fr
glass bottle with the company logo and all of the 5
employees of Quanta System S.p.A. received, in

their Christmas package, an aluminum canteen with

this symbol on it in order to promote the use of these S&S
containers and reduce the consumption of plastic.
