BEST PRACTICE
The El.En. S.p.A. approach in the medical sector

 

EI.En. S.p.A. has reinforced the strategic functions of research and development for the purpose of

maintaining their position of leadership in innovation in the field of medical lasers. The company

has implemented a short term process to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness in the

development of new products by reducing to the greatest extent possible the “time to market”
without compromising the level of quality and reliability.

We have concentrated our resources on projects in the areas in which we have the greatest
experience and focused on our core technologies.

Specific skills have also been developed in other technologies like, for example, the sector of body
contouring where we have for the first time applied microwave technology. For this application
and for the rapidly growing aesthetics market in general, new products and new applicative
approaches are constantly required.

The mid- to long-term goal is to achieve substantial innovations which will allow El.En. to increase
their competitive edge on the market by presenting break-through products, consolidate their
market percentage and open new niches both in the aesthetic and surgical sectors. By focusing
attention on the new needs of the market we are improving and developing applicative
technologies and techniques for the so-called "Cool Peel", a minimally invasive dermatological
treatment which is increasingly requested for rejuvenation applications.

There are three main lines of technological innovation: first of all, the implementation of
technological innovations in the field of photonics like the diode sources, laser sources in fiber,
and ultrafast laser sources (picoseconds and femtoseconds), to optimize the radiation-tissue
interaction effectively and safely.

Secondly, new, specific tissue cooling systems to reduce collateral effects to the minimum,
including pain and inflammation after treatment, and which will, at the same time reduce the
duration of the procedure.

Thirdly, the implementation and use of the most sophisticated diagnostic systems which will make
it possible to determine the end point of the treatments in the most reliable way and guarantee
improved effectiveness in conditions of maximum safety for the patient.

Project FOMEMI

Sensors and instruments using Photonic technology for
minimally invasive medicine

 

El. En. is always at the forefront in the search for cutting-edge solutions to meet the needs of the
market and the company is the leader in of a project that is co-financed by the Region of Tuscany.
The project is called FOMEMI, an acronym for FOtonica per MEdicina a Minima Invasivita), and was
concluded in 2019. In collaboration with industrial partners with highly specialized technology
(Fabrica Machinale Srl, B.B. SpA) and qualified research institutions (University of Pisa, Scuola
Superiore Sant’Anna), El.En. studied new solutions which combine photonics, optics and ICT
(acquisition and elaboration of images for diagnosis and minimally invasive therapies) in order to
contribute to the improvement of clinical practices in sectors having a strong social and economic
impact.

During this project, they studied and developed laser technologies and devices for different
clinical applications like the cornic pathologies of diabetic feet; removal of neoformations of the
breast and brain, and treatment of benign hypertrophy of the prostate. We developed a high
resolution vision system with multi-spectral lighting of images, even three-dimensional ones; with
this instrument we intend to gather data during the evolution of the wound after the treatments,
on the size of the area of the lesion and the segmentation, even in interaction with the operator,
in order to define the regions occupied by the various components present and typical of the
pathology, and record the evolution over time during the various therapy sessions.

ASACampus

 

oo The subsidiary company of the Group, ASA S.r.l. has always been
—_ involved in research and development of their systems. Their

laboratory which is called ASA Campus, was created in 2007 from the

cooperation between ASA Laser and the Department of Experimental
CAMPUS and Clinical Biomedical Sciences of the University of Florence. This
laboratory makes it possible to test the validity of the work of the
company and to improve their performance over time. The results
of the research are used for advancement in the development of technical instruments
and therapeutic procedures and spread by means of symposiums thanks to the important
partnerships, and published in numerous scientific journals; many of these studies have
already been published in international magazines and others are now in press.

 

The medical devices for laser therapy and magnetotherapy are built according to technological
content and essential functional requirements: advanced technology and _ software,
effectiveness and safety, ergonomics and design. They make it possible to apply healing
methods that are increasingly targeted and personalized. The effectiveness of the therapies
is continually tested thanks to the research conducted by ASA Campus on the technological
innovations in laser therapy and magnetotherapy and on the mechanisms of the action at
the level of cells and tissue, the results of which are continually transmitted to the clinical
applications.
