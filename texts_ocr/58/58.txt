For the calculation of the Scope 1 2018 and 2019 emissions we have considered respectively the emission factors of
Department for Environmental Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 2018 and 2019.

For the calculation of Scope 2 emissions we have used different factors based on the calculation methods of the
different countries. In particular:

+ For the location-based method we have used average emission factors related to the generation of national energy
for the different countries in which we operate as reported in the publication Confronti Internazionali, Terna 2016 e
2017, respectively for 2018 and 2019;'°

+ For the market-based method we used average emission factors derived from the production of electricity in the
EU for Italy, France and Germany, published in the document Residual Mix Results, Association of issuing bodies (AIB),
2017 and 2018, respectively for 2018 and 2019. For the other countries we have used the same factors used for the
location-based method.

"Asa result of the refinement of the monitoring system of electrical energy and gas for the company cars of the Chinese subsidiaries of the Group,
the data for 2018 for the geographic area called “Rest of the World” have been revised with respect to those published in the preceding NFS. For
these data, please consult the NFS, published on the site www.elengroup.com. in the section Investor Relations / Sustainability / Reports.

'61t should be noted that the Scope 2 emissions calculated with the emission factors published by Terna in the International Comparisons document
are expressed in tons of CO,; in any case, the percentage of methane and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on the total emissions of greenhouse
gas (CO,..), as can be seen from the specific technical literature.

To calculate the water consumption we used estimates when precise data were not available; in particular, for Quanta System S.p.A., El.En S.p.A.
and Otlas S.r.l. part of the consumption was estimated on the basis of the daily consumption reported by the supplier of the water service.
