Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

 

Type of risk

Method of handling

 

administrators is monitored and controlled by the
appropriate software and appropriate procedures. The
data flow that takes place via e-mail, e-commerce,
order entry is protected through regularly updated
electronic certificates. A storage upgrade is planned for
the new fiscal year on both the production and the DR
site that will allow a full replication of production on the
DR site.

 

Risks related to changing customer
preferences and increased competition
The Group attributes its success to the
consumer's appreciation for the style
and quality of its products, while still
contemplating the hypothesis of any
changes in consumer tastes which the
Piquadro Group cannot anticipate and
that they may be able to be satisfied by
competitors.

The Group's management considers that the key
factors in countering these risks are:

- the ability to offer products in line with the
expectations of reference consumers;

- the pursuit of appropriate marketing policies;

- maintaining and developing its production model as
well as

- maintaining and strengthening its single-brand and
multi-brand distribution capacity

 

Economic and financial risks related in
particular to credit risk from
commercial transactions or financing
activities, liquidity risk related to the
availability of financial resources
access to the credit market and market
risk, better division into exchange rate
risk components (given by operating in
non-Euro currency areas) and interest
rate risk for exposure to instruments
interest-generating financial
institutions.

Risk management is carried out at central level in the
context of specific organisational directives governing
their management and the control of all transactions
that have a narrow relevance in the composition of
financial and/or commercial assets and liabilities.

For example, in relation to exchange rate risk,
Management adopted a risk-containment strategy
better defined as a "hedge accounting policy" which
consists of continuous coverage of the risks of
purchases on a six-month time horizon based on the
amount of orders issued.

 

In relation to the issues of sustainability, the following areas of risk are also highlighted:

procedure. These areas were also analysed in the
