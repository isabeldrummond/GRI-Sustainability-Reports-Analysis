Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

 

Type of risk

Management arrangements

 

Social risks related to non-compliance
with the specific regulations of the
relative products among other things,
on the impact of the products
themselves on health and safety, the
failure to meet customer expectations ,
the inadequacy of the research and
development process.

The products are subject to rigorous controls to ensure
their quality and safety: special laboratory tests are
carried out on both the finished products and materials
to test for resistance, structural integrity, hydro-
repellent qualities and non-toxicity. As a benchmark,
the Group has the REACH European Regulation which
governs the use of hazardous chemicals in production
processes with compliance also from its suppliers,
where applicable. In addition, the Group has adopted a
specific intellectual property management procedure.

 

Risks related to personnel in the
unsuitability of the attraction and
recruitment process, development
plans and staff motivation, as well as
the inadequacy of occupational health
and safety measures.

In the Code of Ethics, The Group has formalised its
commitment to ensure the physical and moral integrity
of its employees and internal collaborators, working
conditions regarding individual dignity and safe and
healthy work environments, in full compliance with the
current legislation. The Parent Company and the
Italian subsidiary The Bridge, have carried out
workplace risk analysis, formalised in the RAD (Risk
Assessment Document).The same was done by the
French company Lancel Sogedi S.A.

In order to improve staff training in this area, Piquadro
is implementing new procedures related to
occupational health and safety whereas The Bridge
S.p.a. is currently developing the management of
these risks.

 

Risks related to the fight against active
and passive corruption are linked to
the possibility of the Group's
management and staff carrying out
unethical, unauthorised, violations of
rules and regulations, unlawful with
particular reference to the crime of
active and passive corruption.

The Group has formalised the values of ethics and
integrity which inspire its business in the Code of
Ethics: through the dissemination of this, it seeks to
spread a culture of social responsibility when
conducting the business.

The Parent Company and The Bridge S.p.a., in
addition, have adopted an Organisational and
Management Model pursuant to Legis. Decree 231/01
under which areas and operations which are most at
risk of crime have been identified and analysed, for
example, such as requesting authorisations, grants,
licences and certifications, sponsorships and
donations, as well as the risks of dealing with external
entities both public and private (Revenue Agency,
I.N.P.S, I.N.A.I.L).The Parent Company is planning to
construct and adopt for the company Lancel Italia S.r.l.
an Organisational and Management Model in line with
that stipulated by Legis. Decree 231/01.
