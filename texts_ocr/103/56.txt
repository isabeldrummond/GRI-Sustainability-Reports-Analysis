Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

The French subsidiary Lancel Sogedi S.A. is equipped with an employee representative body
(formerly CHSCT and now CSE - a health and safety committee) which contributes to
protecting its workers’ wellbeing, health and safety. This body actively takes part in improving
working conditions and guarantees that all the elements relating to occupational safety are
respected. The CSE is responsible for analysing all the risks to which employees could be
exposed in the workplace and establishes any corrective and preventative actions necessary.
To carry out this analysis, the CSE regularly conducts studies, surveys and inspections.

In order to prevent and improve safety in the workplace, CSE consultations take place every
month (at least four meetings a year are mandatory). These meetings analyse the structure
of the business organisation (e.g. workloads, work rhythms and increased work duties), the
environment (e.g. temperature, lighting, ventilation or workplace noise) and working hours.

It should be pointed out that the CSE has decision-making authorities, so it can initiate an alert
procedure in the event of serious and imminent risk or serious risk to public health or the
environment. These actions are summarised in the "Unique Document" drawn up for both the
headquarters and the stores.

In the period under review, the data on accidents has increased as compared to 2017/2018,
also due to the fact that during this period the Lancel Group joined. The latter was acquired
on 2 June 2019 and recorded eleven workplace accidents.

The accidents which occurred outside Europe were mainly at the Uni Best company located
in China. The number of accidents recorded there, which is higher than in other geographical
areas, is due to the diversity of tasks carried out. Whereas in Italy and in the rest of Europe
the employees mainly do office or sales tasks, in China, workers are employed almost
exclusively in production and therefore in potentially riskier activities. The main types of injuries
detected were wounds and bruises, crush injuries and cuts. During the 2018/2019 financial
year, no fatal injuries were recorded.

13 From this NFS _a decision was made to proceed with accident data reporting using the new GRI 403 standard, published by
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in 2018 to replace the version used to date which was published in 2016. For comparison
purposes, data as at 31 March 2018 has been restated as compared to that published in the previous NFS following the update
of the GRI 403 standard. The accident rates have been calculated as the ratio between the total number of accidents and the
number of total hours worked, using a multiplication factor of 1,000,000. For previously published data, please refer to the NFS
of 31 March 2018, published on the website www.piquadro.it in the Investor Relations/Sustainability Report section. It should also
be noted that only events which led to at least one or more days of absence were considered as accidents. The 2017/2018 data
does not include the companies Piquadro Taiwan Ltd., Piquadro Swiss SA, Piquadro Deutschland GmBH, Piquadro UK Limited,
representing approximately 3% of Group employees. The 2018/2019 data does not include the companies Piquadro Deutschland
GmBH and Piquadro UK Limited, representing approximately 0.4% of Group employees.
