The Piquadro Group continues the century-old Italian tradition of leather processing,
interpreting it in a modern and original way.

In Piquadro’s products, the brand’s identifying values, design, comfort and technology blend
with the taste of craftsmanship, the quality of precious leathers and the attention to detail.
The leather, carefully treated to enhance the texture and prevent wear and tear, is combined
with technologically state-of-the-art fabrics to produce recognisably aesthetic and essential
items.

The leather used by The Bridge is also carefully selected and the leather work is mainly done
by Italian tanneries, following the most rigorous workmanship techniques, from the tanning
phase to dyeing and finishing. Vegetable tanning, which involves the use of only natural
tannins, is one of the features of the collection’s classic products. The attention to the
materials used and the leather and to the accessories with their classic golden colour means
that every single product of The Bridge is unique.

The quality of the materials used, alongside the extreme attention paid during the different
stages of production, as well as the final checks and finish of the products, ensures and
guarantees excellent quality.

All companies in the Group subject their products to rigorous controls in order to ensure
excellent quality and avoid health risks due to the use of improper materials. In an advanced
test lab with specialised machinery, both products and raw materials are tested to check their
resistance, structural integrity, hydro repellence and non-toxicity.

In order to ensure compliance with the high-quality standards, the Group uses the European
Regulation, REACH as a benchmark, for registration, evaluation, authorisation and
restriction of hazardous chemicals during production processes. In particular, the chapters
on acquisition stipulate, where applicable, the need to respect expected fulfilments. In addition,
the Group relies on the support of an external laboratory to carry out sample chemical tests
on raw materials in order to check the compliance with the parameters defined by the
aforementioned regulation for dangerous substances.

During the course of 2018/2019, no cases of non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary
codes relating to the health and safety impacts of products were recorded.
