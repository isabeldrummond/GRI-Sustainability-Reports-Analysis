Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

5. Our bond with the local area

 

 

Piquadro, The Bridge and Lancel are strongly linked to the territory in which
they were born and they are a reference point for many families and a source
of training, income and professionalism for many workers.

Among the Group's activities there are also several community initiatives:

 

 

During the 2018/2019 financial year, the Piquadro Group paid more than €80,000 in
donations to non-profit organisations and local associations for development and promotion
purposes and sponsored social and cultural events in the area.

The Bridge, in particular, has regular contact with schools and training facilities in general that
are located in the Florentine basin: through the activation of curricular, extracurricular and
apprenticeship contracts, it has frequent contact with Polimoda and with MI.TA (Made in Italy
Tuscany Academy) the first Higher Technical Institute in the field of technical professions for
fashion with offices in Scandicci (Florence).

Fondazione Famiglia Palmieri

The Palmieri Family Foundation, founded in 2009, came from Marco and Beatrice Palmieri’s
desire to continue their philanthropic activity and enhance diversity through a situation which
was not just based on welfare but focussed on creating new business models. The aim is to
promote activities aimed at study, research, training, innovation in the field of job creation and
employment opportunities for people from disadvantaged groups.

With this purpose and an unprecedented entrepreneurial approach, the Foundation aims to
introduce to the market the non-profit companies which host people with disabilities and offer
them opportunities to enter the world of work, so that they can stand on their own. In this
regard, we remember the “Happy Box’ initiatives since 2009 on solidarity and support projects
to enhance the diversity and integration of differently abled people and the competition "Less
is more" aimed at rewarding social start-ups.
