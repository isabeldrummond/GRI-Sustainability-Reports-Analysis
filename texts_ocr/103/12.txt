it in relation to specific needs, they can formally adopt these as a management tool and an
effective element of its strategy and organisation.

The Code of Ethics therefore contains the set of rights, duties and responsibilities of all
those who, for any capacity, work at or for Piquadro.

Moral integrity is a constant value and duty for the Piquadro Group, characterising all the
organisation’s behaviour and in no case does pursuing the Group’s interest justify an action
which is not coherent with the principles of the Code. Therefore, each individual must pay
attention to circumstances which may be indicators of misconduct and act promptly to avoid
misconduct.

The Piquadro Group leadership team, also referring to the indications received by the
Supervisory Board set up under Legis. Decree 231/2001, is required to periodically review the
Code of Ethics and to ensure constant updating.

Organisational and Management Model

The Organisational and Management Model of the Parent Company Piquadro S.p.A. and
the subsidiary The Bridge S.p.A. involves every aspect of the company business to correctly
manage activities which are at risk of crime and possible conflict of interest situations. In
particular, the checks involve, with different roles and at different levels, the Board of Directors,
the Board of Statutory Auditors, the Internal Audit, the Supervisory Board, the Independent
Auditors, the executives and all staff, representing an essential aspect of the company’s
business. With regard to the aspects of "control", the Model, in addition to providing for the
establishment of an autonomous and independent Supervisory Board, ensures the integration
and coordination of the latter's activities with the existing system of internal controls, using the
experience gained. The Model, however, aims to provide greater assurance about the
compliance of business practices and activities with the rules of the Code of Ethics and the
company's legislation, which states the principles in the discipline of activities at risk of crime.
The Model also provides a system which can provide timely reporting, depending on the case,
of the occurrence or existence of abnormal situations. The Parent Company is planning to
build and adopt for the company Lancel Italia S.r.l. an organisation and management model
in line with Legis. Decree 231/01.

The companies aim to guarantee that the personnel is aware of the organisation and
management model and the Code of Ethics when appointing a specific training course relating
to the themes above.

In order to ensure the effective dissemination of the Model, the Code of Ethics and the
information of the personnel with reference to the contents of Legis. Decree 231/2001 and
the obligations from this, a specific area of the company's IT network is set up for the issue
(in which they are present and available, in addition to the documents which make up the set
of information described above, as well as the reporting tools to the Supervisory Board and
any other relevant documentation).

In addition, in order to comply with Law 179/17 (see whistle blowing system) and to
encourage reporting behaviour that could determine or help determine the responsibility ex
Legis. Decree 231/2001, the Parent Company and The Bridge S.p.A. has adopted a signalling
