Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

Methodological note

This document is the consolidated non-financial statement (hereinafter also "NFS" or
"Sustainability Report") of the Piquadro Group (hereinafter also "the Group") prepared in
accordance with Legis. Decree 254/16 and relates, as applicable, to understanding the
business activity, its performance, results and the impact of the product itself, regarding the
issues stipulated in Art. 3 of Legis. Decree 254/16, referring to the fiscal year ended 31 March
2019 (from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019).

As foreseen by Art. 5 of Legis. Decree 254/16, this document constitutes a separate report
and it is marked with specific terminology to identify it as the NFS required by law.

This Sustainability Report was prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative
Sustainability Reporting Standards defined in 2016 by the GRI (hereinafter "GRI Standards")
according to the "core" option. In addition, where appropriate, the guidelines of the
2017/C215/01 EC Guidelines were also taken into account.

The definition of the relevant aspects for the Group and its stakeholders took place according
to a structured process of materiality analysis, which also included a comparison of material
topics with sector best practices, as described in the paragraph "Materiality analysis". As
regards the information required by Art 3, paragraph 2 of Legis. Decree 254/16, it is noted
that, given the type of business, the following issues are not included in the reporting scope
as they were not considered relevant to ensure an understanding of the Company’s activities:
. the use of water resources, as these are used exclusively for sanitary purposes;

. polluting air emissions other than greenhouse gas emissions.

The scope of the economic, social and environmental data and information reported in this
document refers to companies consolidated line-by-line in the Group’s Consolidated Financial
Statements at 31 March 2019, listed in the "Corporate Structure" section of this document.
With reference to significant changes in fiscal year ended 31 March 2019, it is noted that on 2
June 2018 Piquadro S.p.A. signed a contract of sale for the acquisition of Lancel International
S.A., a Swiss company which owns the "Lancel" brand. No further significant variations are
reported on changes in the Group's size, organisational structure, ownership structure and
supply chain.

In order to allow the comparability of data and information over time and to assess the Group's
performance, a comparison with the previous year is proposed. In this regard, it should be
noted that comparability of the data is influenced by the acquisition of Lancel International
S.A., whose data is related to only ten months of operation within the Group (from 1 June 2018
to 31 March 2019).The re-statement of the previously published data is clearly referred to as
such. In addition, in order to give a correct representation of performance, the use of estimates
has been limited as much as possible; where estimates have been used, these are based on
the best methodologies available and appropriately reported.

The frequency of the reporting of non-financial information and the publication of the NFS is
annual: this document was approved by the Board of Directors of Piquadro S.p.A. on 10 June
2019.

The Report is also subject to a limited assurance engagement (according to the criteria set
out by the ISAE 3000 Revised principle) by Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. The verification was
carried out according to the procedures outlined in the" Independent Auditor’s Report", which
is included in this document.
