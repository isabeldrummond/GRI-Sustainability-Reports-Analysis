Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

4.4 Waste management

 

The Parent Company has implemented a waste management procedure

developed as part of the organisation and management Model. It aims to
establish ways of managing and disposing of urban and assimilated waste
(wood, paper, cardboard, plastic, etc.), as well as the management of special
waste such as electrical and electronic appliances, used toners and cartridges,
managed through authorised suppliers and in compliance with current
regulations. The correct implementation of the procedures is also requested
and protected by disciplinary and sanctioning measures in the event of
violations.

 

 

 

The Piquadro Group has always been conscious of and attentive to the way in which waste is
managed and disposed of, in accordance with current regulations. It is fully aware of the
correctly managed duty towards public health and when considering the rights of future
generations.

During the 2018/2019 tax year, the Piquadro Group produced a total of approximately 303
tonnes of waste, almost all of which were non-hazardous.
