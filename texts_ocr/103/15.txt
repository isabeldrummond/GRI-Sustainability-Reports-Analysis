Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

 

Type of risk

Method of handling

 

Risks related to the production activity
and supply of raw materials, linked to
significant changes in the
macroeconomic, political, fiscal or
legislative framework in areas where
the Group's products are
manufactured, as well as the Group's
inability to maintain and renew its
business relationships.

The Group has a historical presence in the countries
where it operates at the production level and employs
its staff in both the production and financial
administrative areas. In addition, the Group operates a
constant analysis of possible local issues ensuring full
updating in terms of local regulations. In addition, the
scouting of possible new suppliers in different
geographical areas continues.

 

Risks related to the operation on
multiple international markets and the
distribution network, linked to possible
changes in the political and economic
situation in different countries, the
need to face competition from
operators in different markets,
difficulty in being able to satisfy the
clientele tastes of different countries,
the greater difficulty in protecting their
products from counterfeiting activities.

For a long time, the Group has diversified its
investments and its presence in Europe and Asia. In
addition, although the indirect sales channel still
accounts for a significant percentage of sales, the
Group has been in a policy of retail expansion for
several years, leading to the opening of direct-to-
manage stores throughout the and thus to increase the
sales channel managed directly by the organisation.

 

Risks related to the protection of
intellectual property rights and
counterfeiting related, therefore, to the
protection of rights related to design,
processes and production
technologies, utility models as well as
brands and other trademarks signs all
of which are crucial for the success of
the products on the market and the
Group's competitive positioning.

The Group employs a company that specialises in
protecting everything related to intellectual property
(brands, trademarks, ornamental models, utility
models, patents, etc.).

Trademarks are registered in virtually every country in
the world; even in those where the Group does not yet
operate.

With regard to the protection of trademarks, the Group
has also been operating for many years a system of
monitoring new registration requests, so that, already
at the initial stage, it can counter any registration
concessions of brands that have relevance to their
own.

 

Risks related to the integrity of the
information system identified in
particular in data integrity, continuity
of the I.T. system and segregation to
external and internal access to
information (vulnerabilities).

The Group implements updating procedures to ensure
that it is defended against external attacks of computer
viruses. On the continuity of the information system:
Piquadro has a data centre with redundant virtualised
servers on three equivalent nodes renewed in January
2019. The server room, armoured and fireproof, is
equipped with: intrusion and smoke detectors, flood
and temperature sensors all connected to the alarm
control unit that can alert selected personnel in the
event of problems detected. The Disaster Recovery
site has been relocated to Florence in the server room
of The Bridge, it is updated via VPN via a 100 MB
connection with fully dedicated bandwidth at night and
partially reserved during the day. Almost all servers are
replicated (all critical ones) with a maximum RPO of 24
hours. During this exercise, Piquadro replaced the
firewall with single sign-on integration with active
directory and internet access profiling. The antivirus
used on all systems connected to the corporate
network is NOD 32 kept up to date with the latest
version and monitored through its administration
console. With regard to data integrity, this is stored on
databases whose access by developers and
