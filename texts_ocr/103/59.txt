Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

 

The leather used for some of The Bridge products is made from vegetable tanning.
This technique requires the leather to be worked only using natural tannins contained in
wood, bark, leaves and tree fruit. Vegetable tanning means working with a lower
environmental impact than more widespread methods which involve the use of chromium, it
does not contain toxic substances which are harmful to humans and the environment and is
also usually well tolerated by people who are allergic to heavy metals.
"Vegetable tanning" is the oldest and most recognisable technique, the only one
capable of giving leather unmistakable properties and making the end product unique.

With regard to chemical agents or other hazardous materials, this is limited to the repair
department where glue, detergents and colours are used in a non-continuous manner. On
such sporadic occasions, all necessary precautions are taken by workers, under the indication
of health and safety procedures.

In addition, the Parent Company and subsidiary The Bridge S.p.A., within the framework of
the organisation and management Model under Legis. Decree 231/01, analysed any possible
risks potentially related to the use of these substances, revealing that the type of activities
carried out within the Group's companies do not appear to be such as to expose workers to
risks to their health and safety.
