Deloitte.

In addition, for material information, taking into consideration the Group’s activities and characteristics:
* at the parent company’s and subsidiaries’ level:

a) with regards to qualitative information included in the NFS, and specifically with reference to the
business management model, policies applied and main risks, we carried out interviews and
gathered supporting documentation in order to verify its consistency with the available evidence;

b) with regards to quantitative information, we carried out both analytical procedures and limited
verifications in order to ensure, on a sample basis, the correct aggregation of data.

¢ for Piquadro S.p.A., The Bridge S.p.A. and Lancel Sogedi S.A., which we selected based on their
activities and their contribution to the performance indicators at the consolidated level, we carried
out site visits, during which we have met their management and have gathered supporting
documentation with reference to the correct application of procedures and calculation methods used
for the indicators.

Conclusion
Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of

the Piquadro Group as of March 31, 2019 is not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with article
3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI Standards.
