Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

4.3 Air emissions

With regard to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in the 2018/2019, the Group produced 1,999
t COzeq according to the location-based” calculation method, deriving from the consumption
of electricity and non-renewable fuels.

In particular, direct emissions (Scope 1), i.e. from consumption of natural gas, LPG, diesel and
petrol amounted to around 599 t CO2eq.

Indirect emissions (Scope 2) on the other hand, resulting from the purchase of electricity from
the grid, amounted to a total of around 1,400 t CO2 according to the location-based calculation
method and around 1,647 t CO2 according to the "market-based" calculation method.

” GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards provide two methodologies for calculating the emissions of Scope 2: "Location-based"
and "Market-based". The "Location-based" reflects the average intensity of emissions from the total national electricity production,
while the "Market-based" method reflects the emissions from electricity that companies have chosen to use and is therefore
calculated by emission factors that also consider contractual instruments for the sale and purchase of certified electricity.
18 |t should be noted that for better alignment with what is required by the GRI 305-1 standard to calculate Scope 1 emissions,
an updated source of emission factors was used that restores emissions into CO2eq. Emissions from Scope 2 are instead
expressed in tonnes of CO2, however, the percentage of methane and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on total greenhouse
gas emissions (CO2eq), as inferred from the related technical literature. It should be noted that following the process of improving
the reporting system of greenhouse gas emissions and updating the sources of the emissions factor sources, data for 2017/2018
has been restated as compared to that published in the previous NFS. For previously published data, please refer to the NFS of
31 March 2018, available on the website www.piquadro.it in the Investor Relations/Sustainability Report section.
' To calculate Scope 1 emissions, the emission factors published by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, UK
(DEFRA), in Greenhouse gas reporting - Conversion factors 2018 were used.
2 To calculate Scope 2 emissions with the “location-based” method, emission factors reported within the publication Confronti
Internazionali, Terna 2016 were used. With regard to the calculation of emissions using the “market-based” method, Residual
mix emission factors were used published by the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) in the document European Residual Mixes
2017; these factors have only been applied for the following countries: Italy, French Great Britain and Spain. In other cases where
factors were unavailable, the same factors used for the calculation with the “location-based” method were maintained.
