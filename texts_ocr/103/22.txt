Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

Materiality analysis

The aim of the materiality analysis is to identify significant aspects which have a significant
impact on the Groups’ business, from an economic, social and environmental point of view,
and which could substantially influence the assessments and decisions of its stakeholders.
The analysis was carried out in line with the principles defined by the GRI Sustainability
Reporting Standards and involved the top management of the company and some members
of the Board of Directors as well as some stakeholders (employees, B2B and B2C customers,
suppliers and distributors) by submitting a questionnaire online.

The topics assessed were identified by benchmark analysis and taking into account the
specifics of the sector and the Piquadro Group.

For the 2019/20 financial year, the Piquadro Group is committed to deepening and expanding
engagement activities and the stakeholders involved.
