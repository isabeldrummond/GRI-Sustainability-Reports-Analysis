Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

Lancel’s research and development is carried out by a dedicated team of specialists at the
headquarters of the Parisian company.

Maison Lancel is known for innovation and creativity: the team develops all the components
and finished products alongside the design team.

All the metal pieces are created and developed by the team starting from 3D design, 3D
printing for style until quality control and “master” control.

All the leather is carefully

selected by the mee
department and with the help of
a leather goods specialist. Each
skin colour is defined by the
Design department and
developed uniquely for Lancel.

The team of specialists dedicated to product R&L to product R&D,
diligently studies and proposes new materials such as
iconic fabrics, pineapple fibres, fishing line fabrics, and
plastic injected with a glitter effect or marble.

      

Lancel’s products come from the combination of their archives, the continuous study of design
and the expertise of leather goods with the help of the Atelier, located at the Lancel
headquarters, made up of "compagnon du devoir'" craftsmen who make the prototypes of the
new models.

In size and wealth, Maison Lancel’s archives include approximately 3,500 items of leather
goods, small leather goods, luggage, 1,200 pieces of art, 300 sketches and paper models and
they contribute to the brand’s image and influence, embodying, in the" Parisian elegance", the
four universes: women, men, travel, the art of gifting.

Lancel, usually closed to the public, was proud to unveil, for the first time, the wealth of its
heritage during the "Journées du Patrimoine" on 15 and 16 September 20 2018, revealing the
diversity of the skills and talents of its building at Rue d'Ampeér, 17, al
Paris.

The day included a visit to the premises with the presentation of the
articles present in the historical archives from 1876 to the present day;
Together with this, design courses and lessons were held by artisans
specialised in the manufacture of Lancel-branded handbags.

The Atelier also produces specially ordered items or bespoke designs
to meet the expectations of Lancel's sophisticated clientele.

The R&D department is involved in an ever-expanding range of
products which satisfies market demand: leather goods, small leather
