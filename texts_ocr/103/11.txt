management have been codified in the Code of Ethics, implemented and
applied by all the companies in the Group: this contains the set of rights, duties
and responsibilities of all those who, in any capacity, operate in or for Piquadro.
The leadership of the Parent Company is required to periodically review and
update the document on the basis of the internal Supervisory Board's reports.

and international laws and regulations, as well as, where present, internal
procedures set under the organisation and management Model pursuant to
Legis. Decree 231/01.

The Piquadro Group has never solely focused on results alone but also on the way in which
these results are obtained.

A key component of the Piquadro Group’s approach to business has always been its strong
ethical culture which has led to a commitment to avoid and eliminate potentially opportunistic
behaviour. Piquadro believes in the values of integrity, fairness, transparency and
innovation, thanks to its a strong and recognised cultural identity. The Piquadro Group also
aims to reconcile competitiveness on the market with compliance to competition regulations
and to promote, as regards social and environmental responsibility, the correct and
responsible use of resources.

In June 2008, the Parent Company adopted the Organisational and Management Model
(hereinafter also the "Model") pursuant to Legis. Decree 231/2001 and adopted the Group
Code of Ethics, to set up a structured and organic system of rules to enable the prevention
of illegal behaviour by monitoring areas and activities at risk and guarantee the ethical
management of the business.

From 2017 the subsidiary The Bridge S.p.A. also instituted the Supervisory Board and adopted
the Group Code of Ethics. Following the acquisition of the Lancel Group in 2018, the Parent
Company is working to also extend the Code of Ethics to the new subsidiary.
