Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

The Piquadro Group is inspired by integrity and aims to bring fairness and ethical values also
into external relations.

For this purpose, the Code of Ethics is expressly addressed not only to administrators and
internal workers, but also to external employees, customers, agents and, of course, suppliers.
In addition, the Group plans to adopt a supplier Code of Conduct and implement a sharing
process with the main categories of business partners.

The Group does not provide for, in the qualification process and selection of new suppliers,
social and/or environmental criteria; the Group aims to insert new parameters relating to the
protection of human rights and other social and environmental criteria by March 2020.
