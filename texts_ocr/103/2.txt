Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

Letter from the Chairman

A year has passed since we began the journey to clarify the issues related to social
responsibility which permeate our work and our daily life.

During this year, the Piquadro Group has become larger and has acquired a prestigious French
brand, La Maison Lancel, founded in 1876 in Paris and which has led the Group for the first
time, along with the organic growth of the Piquadro and The Bridge brands, to exceed the
threshold of one hundred million euros in turnover. Today our Group has a turnover of 149
million euros and employs 1,168 people in various parts of the world.

These results make us proud of the work we have done and further emphasise the
responsibility to work according to the core values of our Group such as integrity, fairness and
transparency as well as the attention to passion for work, quality and production.

We have grown but we haven't changed.

Growing means placing greater and more coherent attention on the value of people, the true
heritage of our group, their skills, as well as respect for the environmental values, communities
and territories that surround us.

We are committed (and will continue) to work to ensure the sustainability of the way we operate
by adopting behaviour patterns and procedures which respect everyone.

And also, in the external, non-organic dynamics of development, we have adopted this model
by choosing Maison Lancel, which was already way ahead in the paths of sustainability and
respect for values which are similar to and coherent to our own.

Sustainability in Piquadro and its diversified entities, with its extended geography, is an integral
part of governance, our development model, our way of doing business which is enriched by
new people, new issues and who will never take a step backwards.

This year, even more so, we can say that social responsibility is part of us and it is a
fundamental element of our business to create sustainable value for our current and future
stakeholders.
