Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

3. Our people

Human resources are an indispensable factor for a company’s existence, development and
success. For this reason, the Piquadro Group protects and promotes the value of human
resources in order to improve and increase the assets and competitiveness of the skills
possessed by each employee and collaborator in the corporate organisational context.

In this context, the Code of Ethics explicitly refers to what is contained in the "Declaration on
the fundamental principles and rights at work" adopted by the International Conference of the
ILO (International Labour Organisation) in 1998 and the fundamental conventions to which it
relates, in particular as regards:

- prohibition of forced labour: forced labour, slave labour or provided by prisoners is
prohibited;

- freedom to join a trade union and the right to collective bargaining: the right of workers
and employers to organise themselves and the right to form and/or join a trade union of their
choice is recognised. Workers and employers can participate in collective bargaining freely
and independently from public authorities;

- prohibition of child labour and the exploitation of the employment of children : child
labour is prohibited. The minimum age for admission to work must be no less than the age of
finishing compulsory schooling in the countries concerned;

- prohibition of discrimination in employment: workers must be employed on the basis of
their own ability to work and without discrimination based on race, gender, individual
characteristics, religious belief, political views, national or social origin;

- prohibition of harassment: employees and collaborators are prohibited from any behaviour,
from any position, subjected to sexual or moral harassment, psychological violence, bullying
and straining.®

® Straining, in the eyes of the law, consists of a single action or several hostile actions which have lasting effects on a person
who is in a position of inferiority.
