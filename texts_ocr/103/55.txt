3.4 Occupational health and safety

 

 

employees’ health and safety: for this purpose, the Italian companies
Piquadro S.p.a. and The Bridge S.p.a. have adopted an ad hoc management
process, including a “safety chart”. The procedure has been drawn up following
a risk assessment analysis connected to the employees’ workplace and duties.
Within the context of the Group’s work, the risk assessment must strive towards
the continuous improvement of the workers’ health and safety at work.

The Group commits to maintaining high standards in safeguarding its

 

 

The Piquadro Group guarantees the physical and moral integrity of its employees and internal
collaborators, work conditions which respect individual dignity and safe and salubrious
working environments, in full respect of the current regulations of preventing accidents at work
and worker protection.

To this end, the Italian companies Piquadro S.p.a. and The Bridge S.p.a. have set up a
management procedure of safety at work, done following an analysis of potential risks
connected to the activities done by the employees and also implemented thanks to identifying
people responsible for protection (e.g. Head of the prevention and protection service, fire
service personnel, first aid workers). The process also involves monitoring and recording any
accidental “near misses”.

In order to obtain the risk assessment, careful analysis of the work activities and the study of
the relationship between people, equipment, the environment, physical, chemical and
biological factors of each workplace and the place where it develops had to be carried out. In
particular, the assessment process has been developed through : identification of each
particular workplace, identification of hazards present and tasks, a risk analysis for each task,
and the study and preparation of the measures to be applied based on the results of the
assessment.

The risks taken into account range from those relating to the structure and work environments,
to the machinery and equipment used, the hazardous substances with which employees could
come into contact, work related stress, the protection of pregnant personnel in the workplace,
etc.

In the same document, companies are committed to ensuring that each worker receives
sufficient and adequate health and safety training, anticipating a specific relationship between
roles performed and training requirements.

During the financial year ended 31 March 2019, the Italian companies Piquadro S.p.a. and
The Bridge S.p.a. and the production subsidiary Uni Best continued their implementation of
an increasingly refined management system striving for the continuous improvement of safety
in the workplace, monitoring and urging its employees to report any critical issues regarding
safety. Uni Best also provides all new employees with a manual listing the company's general
guidelines and standards including safety in the workplace, thus pursuing its objective to
provide information which can make it easier to create a complete prevention system at its
headquarters.
