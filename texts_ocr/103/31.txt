Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group

Piquadro has also announced its entry into Formula 1 by
signing an agreement which will make it the Official
Supplier of Aston Martin Red Bull Racing Team for the
2019 World Championship.

Piquadro will provide a very innovative backpack and
trolley to the team for all the trips of the racing season on
15-17 March with the Australian Grand Prix and will have
two exceptional faces for the spring summer 2019
advertising campaign: Max Verstappen and his new
teammate Pierre Gasly.

 

The 100% leather Urban backpack is equipped with Bagmotic technology which thanks to the
Connequ app allows interaction via mobile phone, is equipped with a combination lock, an
anti-theft cable and a special pocket for your wallet with RFID protection. The PiQ3 cabin
trolley is the new latest generation travel line, entirely made of virgin polycarbonate which
makes it highly durable and light.

Finally, we remind you of the collaboration between Piquadro and Lamborghini: the limited-
edition backpack was sold online in just 2 hours, 46 minutes and 18 seconds during the flash
sale that began at midday on 18 March 2019. Piquadro and the luxury super sports company
Lamborghini presented the Bagmotic Special Edition Lamborghini backpack at the Geneva
International Motor Show, the exclusive capsule composed of 63 pieces with all the values
which unite the two Italian experts of Made in Italy: the focus on design, the high-tech content
and the attention to detail.

What makes the exclusive Piquadro-
Lamborghini backpack unique is the
internal numbering on the small
carbon skin plate, which only 63 lucky
participants managed to get by
registering for sale online’ on
www.piquadro.com. Bookings, from
all over Italy and the rest of Europe,
did not wait and the limited edition, cult
object (which will not go unnoticed)

 

was immediately sold out.
