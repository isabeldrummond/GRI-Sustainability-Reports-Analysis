Sustainable mobility

Cubogas

Operating globally in the production and sale of methane
gas compression systems, in 2019 it actively contributed
to pursuing Snam's strategy on sustainable mobility, both
in Italy, supplying compressors for the start-up of the

new methane refuelling stations For motor transport,

and abroad, where it was awarded, among other things, a
substantial tender to supply 23 compressors in Greece and
another two tenders in France to supply 6 compressors

or the RATP public transport vehicles, a Parisian company
operating throughout the fle-de-France region.

Cubogas also produces domestic systems, which allow

he refuelling of vehicles directly, at home or at work. It
involves reasonably small systems that are simple to install,
hat can be adapted to the domestic or corporate gas or
electricity grid and are therefore ideal For refuelling the
leets of companies or small municipalities. In 2019, one
of these compressors was installed at the Snam HQ in

San Donato Milanese and many more will Follow at other
premises throughout Italy.

n 2019, Cubogas also made investments aimed at
increasing its production capacity, expanding and
innovating its range of products as well as improving

he quality of the maintenance service provided to its
customers.

n addition to the compression of methane for motor
ransport use, Cubogas also contributes to the
development of biomethane, providing its customers with
echnological solutions to compress the gas produced

by the plants and enable them to be introduced into the
ransportation network. In this context, Cubogas works in
harmony with IES Biogas and Snam 4 Environment within
Snam's Energy Transition Business Unit.
