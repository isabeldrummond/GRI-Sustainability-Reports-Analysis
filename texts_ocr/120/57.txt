THE PRODUCTION OF ENERGY FROM
RENEWABLE SOURCES

In line with the Snam's commitment to reduce the energy
consumption relating to its activities, in 2019 the Company
committed to improving the energy efficiency of its buildings
(territorial headquarters and maintenance centres) and its
gas storage facilities, through the installation of solar panels.
In 2019 the total number of plants reached 1,794 units
(417% compared to 2018) and the installed power increased
by 75 kW compared to 2018, passing From 1,054 kW to 1,129
kW (+7%).

Renewable source plants

This increase mainly involves the installation of 258 new
back-up systems and a new photovoltaic system connected
to the electricity grid.

In 2017 specific KPIs and a quantitative target For energy
efficiency, to be reached by 2022, were set. The results
achieved during the year were in line with the expected
trend with the exception of the target For the electricity
production from photovoltaic plants, which went from
around 1,128,400 kWh in 2018 to around 830,000 kWh in
2019. This reduction was caused by the non-availability oF
several systems adversely affecting the forecasted annual
production.

(1) production is calculated at 1 site that came into operation at mid year. The other site came into operation at the end of the year therefore production is negligible.

(2) some plants came into operation at the end of the year so the savings are negligible.
