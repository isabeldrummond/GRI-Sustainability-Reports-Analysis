EMISSIONS TRADING SYSTEM (ETS)

The carbon dioxide emissions of the Snam Group facilities subject to the ETS were
overall greater than the emission shares allocated. The annual allocation of free
allowances by the competent national authority gradually reduced over the years
as set out From the third regulatory period in Article 10 bis of Directive 2009/29/
EC. In view of around 0.609 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted into the
atmosphere, around 0.202 million tonnes were allocated free of charge, resulting
in a 0.407 million tonne deficit. The allowances allocated also include those
intended For the new gas compression plants of Minerbio and Sergnano in 2018
and 2019.

NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS

The use of natural gas as the main energy source allows sulphur oxides and
particle emissions to be minimised compared to the use of other fossil fuels. OF
these, the only significant emissions are those of nitrogen oxides (NOx) , that
derive mainly From the combustion of natural gas in the gas turbines installed in
the compression plants (thrust and storage). A programme was launched in recent
years to curb these emissions by replacing traditional turbines with low emission
turbines which, to date, account for almost all the turbines installed. Specifically,
with the DLE turbine coming into operation in 2019 in the Minerbio storage plant
as well, all the storage sites were operating with low emission units.

The reduction in energy consumption and the virtually total use of DLE turbines
has led to a reduction in total nitrogen oxide emissions, in absolute terms of -20%
compared to 2018 and a reduction in the ratio between nitrogen oxide emissions
and energy use of 12%.

Average NOx emissions for the installed power of the storage machinery were
further reduced by almost 30% going from 5.2 to 3.7 ([mg/Nm?]/MW) while those
for thrust remained unchanged, taking into account that they had already reached
3.8 ([mg/Nm*]/MW) last year.

Emissions of NOx into the atmosphere were calculated based on direct measurements or, if not available,
through emission factors in literature (EMEP/EEA “Air pollutant emission inventory guidebook” European
Monitoring and Evaluation Programme/European Environment Agency).
