GAS MARKET MONITORING

Under the scope of its evaluations of the wholesale gas
markets, the Authority gave a mandate to the Energy
Market Operator, as Far as competitive aspects of the
gas market are concerned, and to Snam, as the leading
transportation business, to support it with monitoring
activities through: i) the preparation of an integrated
database of transportation and balancing, storage and
regasification services, made available to the Regulator
and supplied on a daily basis; ii) availability of indices and

Developments in Europe

In Europe there is an extensive discussion ongoing on
the role of gas in the Future energy mix and how the new
renewable energy vectors (green gases) can support the
energy transition process.

In 2019, the European Commission launched numerous
studies and analyses to identify a package of measures,
outlined in the European Green Deal in December

2019, aimed at the total decarbonisation by 2050.
Specifically, the main expected development for the

gas infrastructures involve the possibility of embracing

the system and the flexibility of procurement sources; iii)
further specific analyses at the request of the Authority.
Specifically, in 2019, according to its provisions, 15,600
data Flows and periodic reports, as well as analyses
conducted in relation to the services (transportation,
storage and regasification) were sent over to the Authority
in support of the Regulator's activities. Agreements,
manuals and dedicated technical specifications to manage
these activities are shared with the GME and approved by
the Authority.

 

renewable gases and supporting the energy system jointly
with the electricity sector (sector coupling).

Snam played an active role in this process making
contributions, both through the industry associations it is
a member of (e.g. ENTSO-G, Gas Infrastructure Europe and
Hydrogen Europe), and directly, through the development
of specific evaluations based on the requirements
received from the European Commission and European
Regulators (CEER/ACER).
