ENERGY CONSUMPTION

In 2019 the total energy consumption stood at 12,152 TJ (-8.5% compared with
2018) in spite of an overall increase in the gas injected into the network (+3.5%).
This result was Facilitated by the Fact that, compared to 2018, the gas was imported
from less energy-intensive routes, namely there was less use of the North Africa
backbone network.

The energy mix used by the Company is made up almost totally of natural gas
(95.7% of the energy requirements). Other sources used are electricity (3.5%), other
fuels (diesel, oil, LPG) and heat, which together represent the 0.8% of consumption.
Most of the Snam’s energy consumption is due to the gas turbines used in the
compression systems which provide the pressure required for gas transportation
(thrust consumption) and to storage activities, which, overall, represent the 81% of
total consumption, down by 88% from 2018.

In 2019 there was an increase in the energy consumption for the gas regasification
plant, equal to the 10% of the Group's total consumption (3.5% in 2018). This is due
to the increase in the quantity of regasified gas (+170%).
