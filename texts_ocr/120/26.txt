The Snam-Terna joint energy scenarios have made it possible to pool the
specific expertise of the two operators, in the awareness that the interaction
between scenarios in the electricity and gas sectors constitutes a new, very
complex feature, both nationally and at EU level. The results collected in the
Document Describing the Scenarios (DDS 2019), show how collaboration and
the synergies between the electricity sector and the gas sector could be key in
achieving the emission reduction targets.

Specifically, the study conducted jointly by the two operators led to the
development of three different scenarios: the Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario,
the Centralized scenario (CEN), and the Decentralized scenario (DEC).

The BAU scenario features a technological mechanism for switching to more
efficient technologies, guided purely by the market and a reduction in costs, and
does not include reaching the European and national energy reduction targets.
The CEN and DEC development scenarios, on the other hand, represent a

guide for defining a long-term business strategy aimed at decarbonisation. The
two scenarios are rooted in the same macroeconomic context, with relatively
sustained growth of 1.2% for the GDP per year and of the population (+2.4
million inhabitants by 2040) and significant investment in energy efficiency and
technological development. Both scenarios are driven by achieving the European
emission reduction targets by 2030 and move forward on a path that allow to
reach the long-term CO, containment requirements laid down in the European
Commission “2050 long term strategy “. Specifically, in the CEN scenario, the
policy goals are reached thanks to curbing consumption and the development
of renewable energies with significant availability of programmable renewable
resources, such as green gases, leveraging the existing gas infrastructures,
while the DEC scenario envisages the increased development of consumption
electrification associated with the distribution of the generation distributed by
non-programmable renewable energy sources.
