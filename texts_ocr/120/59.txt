 

GHG total emissions

-2.6%

compared to 2018

These activities have allowed the
Company to prevent the emission
into the atmosphere of 181,800
tonnes of CO,,,, the highest figure
in recent years (+17% compared to
2018).

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

The main greenhouse gas emissions (or GHG) resulting from Snam's activities are
methane (CH,), the main component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide (CO,).
Methane emissions arise from the release of natural gas into the atmosphere
and are generated by the normal plant operation, by operations to connect new
gas pipelines and the maintenance thereof, or by accidental events occurring

on infrastructure, whereas the CO, produced is directly correlated with Fuel
consumption and the fuel. In 2019, like last year, the marginal contribution

to direct emissions From the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) in refrigeration
systems was assessed as equal to approximately 1.48 kt CO,,,.

In line with the international reporting methods for GHG emissions, Snam broke
down and analysed its emissions into Scope 1 direct emissions and Scope 2
indirect emissions from energy use and Scope 3 other indirect emissions. Direct
emissions refer to Snam's fuel consumption, while indirect emissions refer to
electricity consumption and heat consumption (Scope 2) and other CO, emissions
released along the company's value chain (Scope 3).

The total GHG emissions stood at around 1.92 thousand tonnes of CO... (-2.6%
compared to 2018). The total reduction in emissions is mainly due to the
interventions implemented to reduce direct emissions (Scope 1), which, however,
was mitigated by the increase compared with the previous year of Scope 3 indirect
emissions relating to business travel and the emissions generated along the
supply chain. Specifically, Snam adopted various initiatives to reduce emissions,
such as, for example:

* recovery of natural gas emissions;

* production of electricity from photovoltaic plants;

* acquisition of green electricity;

+ installation of LED lighting systems;

* renovation and efficiency improvements for buildings;

* greater use of smart working among employees.
