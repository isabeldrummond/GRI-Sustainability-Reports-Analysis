Letter to stakeholders

  
 

Marco Alvera
Chief Executive Officer

Dear Stakeholders,

in 2019 we were the protagonists in the climate change challenge
and in accompanying Italy on its journey to decarbonisation. During
the year we once again increased our investments intended for
energy transition and innovation, defined new and even more
challenging climate goals and we launched our journey for the
discovery and introduction of new energy sources.

As part of the new Strategic Plan to 2023 announced in November,
we allocated over 20% of investments, equal to €1.4 billion, to

the Snamtec project - Tomorrow's Energy Company, in order to
increase Snam's presence in the biomethane sector, confirm its
commitment to sustainable mobility and energy efficiency and be
among the pioneers in the use of hydrogen as the clean energy
vector of the future.

2019 has been another year with a strong Focus on the issue of
climate change, both in terms of public opinion and international
institutions and companies. With this in mind we set a target in the
Strategic Plan of reducing methane emissions by 40% by 2025 and,
for the first time, a target of reducing total CO,,,, emissions by 40%
by 2030 (Scope 1 and 2 emissions).

In order to achieve these challenging targets and promote
interventions and initiatives to transform our infrastructure
network focused on methane to an“energy” infrastructure For
transporting renewable gas and in combination with the electricity
grids.

The Business Unit Energy Transition, dedicated to new green
activities (biomethane, sustainable mobility and energy efficiency),
was established with the goal of building our Future by focusing on
new businesses supporting energy transition.

As part of this, in November Snam completed the acquisition of a
stake of around 83% in Renerwaste, one of the leading companies
in Italy operating in biogas and biomethane infrastructure,

which took place through the new wholly-owned company
Snam4Environment.

Snam also signed a binding letter of intent aimed at negotiating
and defining agreements to launch a strategic partnership in
infrastructure for biomethane from agriculture through the entry,
with a 50% stake, into Iniziative Biometano, a company operating
in Italy with Five biogas plants, For which there is a plan for

conversion to biomethane, and with various plants in the process
of authorisation or construction. The final goal is to specialise and
increase expertise in the management and running of plants both
in the agricultural biomethane chain and the FORSU chain (organic
fraction of municipal solid waste), perfectly complementary to

the expertise of IES Biogas, the Snam subsidiary and leader in the
design and construction of biogas and biomethane plants in Italy
and abroad.

Alongside this, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed

with the Infore Environmental Group, an environmental services
company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, for potential
joint initiatives For the development of biogas and biomethane
infrastructure in China.

Investments in 2019 in the biomethane sector are integrated with
those planned for the sustainable mobility sector supporting the
increase in the Italian network of compressed natural gas and
liquefied natural gas distributors. 50 CNG/L-CNG, biomethane and
bio-LNG filling stations were contracted at 31 December 2019
through the subsidiary Snam4Mobility, the leader in solutions For
natural gas transport refuelling stations. Agreements were signed
with Tamoil, in March 2019, and with IP, in July, For the creation,
respectively of 5 and 26 new natural gas refuelling Facilities in Italy.
As far as energy efficiency is concerned, the sectomin which Snam is
already one of the leading Italian operators through the subsidiary
TEP Energy Solution, we have implemented our role as a leader by
gaining control of TEA Servizi, an ESCO (Energy Service Company)
active in the design of thermohydraulic and electric plants and

in the offering of energy saving solutions for public and private
entities. Snam has also promoted awareness-raising initiatives and
training to strengthen the culture of energy efficiency and support
the commitments undertaken by Italy in/this sector.

For Snam, 2019 was “the year of hydrogen”: we created the
Hydrogen Business Unit, dedicated to the development of this
clean energy vector, and, in April, we launched the first trial in
Europe of a mixture of 5% hydrogen and natural gas introduced
into the Snam transportation network at Contursi Terme (Salerno),
doubling the mixture to 10% in December. Convinced of the

need to adopt this solution to accelerate decarbonisation, Snam
organised The Hydrogen Challenge in Rome last October, an
international event during which hydrogen was discussed with the
