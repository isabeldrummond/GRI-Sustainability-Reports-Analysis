SNAM AND THE EU ENERGY TRANSITION

The initiatives and activities carried out by Snam in Europe
are aimed at promoting the use of gas as a tool to guarantee
the security of the energy system in Europe thanks to the
diversification of procurement sources and routes and to
support the development of new forms of renewable gases
such as biomethane and hydrogen.

In 2019, Snam, courtesy of its role as representing the
interests of the entire gas supply chain through GasNaturally,
took part in the European discussions and round tables on
energy, climate, mobility and sustainable finance, promoting
the use of gas as the ideal energy solution for achieving
future climate targets and supporting the European Union in
its climate neutrality strategy by 2050.

Work continued under the scope of the “Gas for Climate”
consortium, created in 2017 and composed of 9 European
TSOs (Enagas, Energinet, Fluxys, Gasunie, GRTgaz, ONTRAS,
Open Grid Europe, Snam and Teréga) and 2 associations
operating in the sector of renewable gas (Consorzio Italiano
Biogas and European Biogas Association). In 2019 the
consortium promoted the results of a study, commissioned
by Navigant, which highlights the opportunities for European
citizens to achieve annual savings of around €217 billion by
2050 using the existing gas structure for the development of
biomethane and green hydrogen.

Snam continued its activities with the European association
“Natural & bio Gas Vehicle Association” (NGVA Europe) with
he goal of promoting the use of natural gas and biomethane
as alternative energy sources for sustainable mobility, both
and and sea.

Lastly, being part of the Hydrogen Europe and The Hydrogen
Council associations, Snam strives to promote hydrogen as
an energy source that is sustainable and compatible with

he existing gas infrastructure. In addition, as a member of
he World Energy Council, Snam is one of the Founders of

he Hydrogen Global Charter, a shared platform open to

all stakeholders, from institutions to businesses, aimed at
promoting the large-scale development of hydrogen.
