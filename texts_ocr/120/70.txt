WATER AND WASTE MANAGEMENT

Water consumption, water discharge and the production of
waste are environmental aspects for Snam to be carefully
managed, both from the perspective of quality and quantity,
in order to reduce the associated environmental impacts.
The Company started to develop a production cycle that is as
circular and efficient as possible, improving performances in
relation to the consumption of the resources used.

From the point of view of consumption, sea water and Fresh
water are used respectively in the production process and

in company premises. In 2019, approximately 6.23 million
cubic metres of water (6 million cubic metres of sea water
and 0.23 million cubic metres Fresh water) were extracted.
The sea water was collected for cooling the auxiliary systems
in the LNG plant and the same volume was discharged back
into the sea, at a higher temperature (within the legal limits).
The withdrawal was 51% higher than in 2018 Following

the increased operation of the plant equipment. Upstream
storage activities produced approximately 6,159 cubic
metres of process water (+4% compared to 2018), all sent to
an external purification plant for treatment.

The extraction of fresh water, used mainly at the company
premises activities, for Fire-protection systems and to irrigate
green spaces, increased by 70% compared to 2018. With
regard to water discharges, the waste water is channelled
into the sewage networks (42% of the total) or discharged,
after treatment, into the soil and into surface water bodies
(58% of the total).

The sites that cannot be connected to the sewerage system
have closed-cycle phyto-purification systems, a technology
that allows domestic waste water discharges to be
eliminated because they are treated and fully absorbed by
the planted vegetation.

The production of waste comes mainly from plant
maintenance and management activities (71%) and well
drilling activities (29%). In 2019 the total production of
waste stood at approximately 27,823 tonnes (-2% compared
to 2018) of which more than 80% belonged to the non-
hazardous waste category. 42% of waste from production
activities was sent for recovery.
