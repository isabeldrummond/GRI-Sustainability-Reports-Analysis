LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG): A SOLUTION
FOR REDUCING MARITIME AND HEAVY
TRANSPORT EMISSIONS

LNG is produced from natural gas that is cooled and
compressed until it reaches a liquid state. In this Form the gas
can be easily stored and transported, and importing it by sea
allows for further diversification of procurement sources,
with positive effects on national energy security.

LNG can be consumed in traditional systems or as an
alternative to other Fossil fuels for motor transport, rail
transport or sea transport, replacing diesel, Fuel oil or marine
diesel.

The use of LNG instead of diesel has significant
environmental advantages with a considerable reduction in
emissions both in terms of climate altering gases and local
pollutants, especially in the case of the use of LNG from
methane produced from renewable sources. Specifically, the
use of liquefied natural gas allows a reduction in emissions of
fine particles (-97%), nitrogen oxides (-75%) and CO, (up to
100% in the case of the use of BioLNG).

For these reasons, in 2019 Snam developed numerous
initiatives with its partners for the development of small scale
infrastructures with the aim of promoting the production
and distribution of liquid natural gas to advocate sustainable
mobility for ship, lorry and train transportation. Specifically,
Snam completed the upgrading of the Panigaglia terminal

in order to allow the unloading of lorries For the distribution
of LNG and developed Further activities concerning micro-
liquefaction plants. These activities come under the principles
described in the DAFI (Law 257/2016) in order to develop and
increase the use of alternative Fuels throughout Italy).

In 2019 Snam also signed a Memorandum of Understanding
with the FS Foundation and HITACHI for research into and the
operational implementation of the First LNG train in Italy. This
collaboration is the result of the desire of 3 companies to also
transform the railway industry (traditionally electric or diesel)
into a new "customer" for methane also promoting the use
of green fuels to replace diesel. The end of the project is

the first inaugural journey on the tourist lines run by the FS
Foundation expected to take place by the end of 2020 after
the conversion of the diesel engines and tanks to liquefied
natural gas.

Green innovation

Snam is responding with an increase in activities and
investments aimed at achieving the decarbonisation goals.
Investments are continuing in Snamtec, the programme

that combines all activities in the Field of energy efficiency,
technological innovation and energy transition which, in
2019, rose to €1.4 billion. Specifically, Snam plans to double
investments in the new businesses for energy transition to at
least €400 million, compared with the figure of €200 million
in the previous plan.

 

 

The most significant increase involves the sector of
biomethane from organic waste, agricultural and agro-
industrial waste, which will play a strategic role in the journey
to decarbonisation, especially in the sector of sustainable
mobility. Following the Italian government's decision to
incentivise 1.1 billion cubic metres of biomethane for
mobility, and the long-term potential of up to 12 billion cubic
metres of biomethane by 2040 identified in the Snam-Terna
scenarios, there is now a significant interest in this business.
Snam aims to support and accelerate the development of the
Italian market also by investing, through its subsidiaries, in
infrastructure and in the construction of plants.

Snam has plans to invest around €250 million compared
with the €100 million in the previous plan to build plants
with an installed capacity of more than 40 Megawatt. Snam
developed the following initiatives in 2019 with this in mind:
* through the new subsidiary Snam 4 Environment,

it acquired from Ladurner Ambiente and from AB

nvest a stake of around 83% in Renerwaste, one of

the largest companies operating in Italy in biogas

and biomethane infrastructures, for an outlay at the
closing, including the repayment of the shareholders’
‘oan, of around €46 million. This acquisition enabled
Snam to have an operational base of facilities, several
ey senior Figures For the development of the business
and the necessary requirements to participate in

uture public-private partner initiatives. The scope of
this operation includes three project companies (SPV)
that are already operational, two of which own biogas
acilities for cogeneration, with a total supply of around
130 thousand tonnes per year of FORSU (Ecoprogetto
Milano and Ecoprogetto Tortona) and the owner of a
municipal solid waste treatment plant (RSU) with a total
capacity of 75 thousand tonnes per year (Renerwaste
Lodi);

* — itsigned a Memorandum Of Understanding with the
nfore Environmental Group, an environmental services
company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and
the controlling shareholder of Ladurner Ambiente, For
potential joint initiatives For the development of biogas
and biomethane infrastructure in China;

+ it signed a binding letter of intent aimed at negotiating
and defining agreements to launch a strategic
partnership in infrastructure for biomethane from
agriculture through the entry, with a 50% stake, into
niziative Biometano, a company operating in Italy

with Five biogas plants, for which there is a plan for
conversion to biomethane, and with various plants in the
process of authorisation or construction.

Not requiring new investments in infrastructures and helping
to exploit waste and sub-products, biomethane becomes a
vital source For Focusing national and European objectives i
terms of decarbonisation.
