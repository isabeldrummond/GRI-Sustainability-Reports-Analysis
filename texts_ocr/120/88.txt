Employee Engagement & Volunteering Day
In 2019, various initiatives were organised which led to
Snam people making their expertise and efforts available

Foundation and specific initiatives such as "Volunteering
Day". The second edition of the latter was organised.
Compared with the previous year, participation was
doubled, it lasted two weeks and was open to the
Families and Friends of employees and Snam's partners.
750 volunteers signed up, 600 of them employees

and 150 Family members, university students, start-

ups, partners and suppliers. More than 6000 hours of
volunteering were supplied to 70 organisations in the
voluntary sector spread over 60 locations in Italy.

The Solidarity Award was introduced as part of
"Volunteering Day" giving Snam volunteers the
opportunity to choose one of the projects presented by
the 8 organisations that received the greatest number
of submissions, and allocating an extra contribution of
€5,000. The AISM (Associazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla
