Also note that for both scenarios, the ambitious decarbonisation targets require
the progressive penetration of increasing quantities of green gas in the Italian
energy mix, leveraging biomethane, hydrogen and synthetic gases.

The scenarios present different gas demand trends: increasing in the BAU scenario
compared with current demand — 73 billion m? in 2018 — stable in the CEN
scenario and decreasing in the PNIEC and the DEC scenarios. Both the DEC and
CEN scenarios involve the European decarbonisation targets using increasingly
more green gases in the Italian energy mix, relying on hydrogen, biomethane and
synthetic methane.

Specifically, it is estimated that in 2030 the demand for green gas will be 8.3 bcm
in the CEN scenario and 3.7 bcm in the DEC scenario. By 2040 there is expected
to be Further growth in the demand for green gas, equal to 18.5 bcm in the

CEN scenario and 13.2 bcm in the DEC scenario. Green gases will partly replace
natural gas, not only in thermoelectric power plants, but also with end users: civil,
industrial and transportation.

To achieve the “zero emissions" target by 2050, in the context of economic
growth of 1% of the GDP to 2050, Italy should make reductions equal to 420 Mt of
CO, equivalent (-95% compared with now).
