The In-line gas recompression interventions, interventions with tapping machines,
technology that makes it possible to disconnect pipelines in operation for new
connections without an interruption to the service, and other initiatives have
allowed Snam in 2019 to prevent the emission into the atmosphere of 9.4 million
cubic metres of natural gas, equal to around 165,000 tonnes of CO... (+16%
compared with the figure of 142,000 tonnes of CO,,,, in 2018).

As a confirmation of the benefit of the measures taken, emissions of methane per
kilometre of network for the transportation activities fell Further (-12% compared
to 2018 and -15.4% compared to 2017).

The Company's performance indicators are in line with its methane emission
reduction targets. Specifically, in 2019 Snam increased its reduction target For CH,
emissions by 2025, from -25% in 2018 to -40%. The current situation is in line with
this target (-19%).

Furthermore, in 2019 Snam recovered the 56% of natural gas emissions during
maintenance activities, in line with its target of 33% per year by 2022.
