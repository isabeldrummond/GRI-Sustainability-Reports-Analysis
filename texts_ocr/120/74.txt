The Diversity & Inclusion policy
Snam guarantees equal dignity

and opportunities for all its people
regardless of their country of origin,
culture, religion, gender, sexual
orientation, political opinions and

any other characteristic or personal
trait. To promote the dissemination
to employees and contractors of a
culture of equal opportunities, in
October 2019 a specific corporate
policy was established on diversity and
inclusion. The linchpins of the policy
are the creation of a welcoming work
environment with no direct or indirect
discrimination, the application of
specific policies and metrics in human
resources to guarantee fairness in all
phases of the working relationship,
training and the work/life balance.

The absenteeism rate, which in 2019 stood at 4.5%, was essentially aligned to the
previous years, does not include senior management and was calculated taking
into consideration all hours not worked (paid and unpaid) excluding holidays,
leaves and periods of mandatory and voluntary maternity leave. There were no
essential changes between the absenteeism rate For men and women, which
stood at 4.4% and 5,1%, respectively.

The turnover rate for 2019, remained consistent with the 2018 figure thanks to
the hiring campaigns and the support of early retirement, as well as acquisitions
completed during the year.
