Snam Plastic Less

As well as being a serious risk for the environment and animals, plastic is also a
danger to human beings. Proof of this is the report published by the Center For
International Environmental Law (CIEL) which stresses the urgency of adopting
precautionary principles to protect mankind from plastic pollution.

According to Assorimap, the national association for plastic recyclers and
regenerators, in Italy one a quarter of the 2.1 million tonnes of plastic used is
recycled. According to the report “The New Plastics Economy: Catalising Action”
by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, only the 14% of plastic packaging used
globally is collected and sent correctly to the recovery plants; all of the rest is
incinerated, sent to landfill or dispersed into the atmosphere.

Snam wants to make its contribution to reducing the use of plastic and, for this
reason, in 2019, it launched the “Snam Plastic Less” initiative aimed at reducing
the use of plastic in industrial packaging by 100% by 2023 and eliminate single-
use plastic in drinks vending machines at all its company premises by 2020. A
plan aimed at interventions in the supply chain and communication to Company
employees.

In addition, Snam plans adopt new supplier evaluation systems in Future tenders
capable of assessing the use of single-use plastic in packaging and promoting
alternative packaging.

In order to correctly evaluate the
environmental and safety aspects and
impacts associated with its works,
Snam carries out preliminary analyses
under the scope of Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) and
Integrated Environment Authority
(IEA) procedures, Following which
the administrations, both centrally
and locally, release the authorisation
required by applicable law.

Snam also evaluates, in relation to the performance of the most important works
(compression systems or large natural gas pipelines), the direct and indirect
economic and social impact on the territory and on the local communities

with "Social Impact Assessment" tools and methods. Specifically, in 2019, the
collaboration project with the Department of Economics and Management of
the University of Brescia, for the revision of the methodology used adopting a
regionalised input-output model, was concluded. This model made it possible to
evaluate the impact of a project, calculating the added value generated by the
investment starting with the total value of production.
