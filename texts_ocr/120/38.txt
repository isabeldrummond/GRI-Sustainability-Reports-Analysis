Managing the
energy of the Future:
the sustainable
mobility

The deployment of natural gas in the transport sector and the
integration of biogas and biomethane will play a crucial role
in supporting domestic economic growth and in combating
climate change, in a process of rapid global transition
towards decarbonised economies. The ease of transporting
and storing natural gas allows the development of multiple
projects linked to the widespread use of compressed natural
gas (CNG) For motor transport and liquefied natural gas (LNG)
used in heavy land and sea transport. In addition, biomethane
can also be compressed, liquefied, transported and used like
renewable fuel. Alongside the development of low emission
fuels, the commitment outlined in its Strategic Plan means
that Snam will upgrade the existing infrastructure in order to
expand the network of natural gas refuelling stations. This
objective will also be achieved through targeted partnerships
with other sector players, such as the acquisition of Cubogas,
involved in the business of natural gas compressors For
sustainable mobility.

COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS (CNG) FOR
MOTOR TRANSPORT: AN EFFECTIVE
RESPONSE TO TRANSPORT GENERATED
POLLUTION

The natural gas transported in the Snam network can be
compressed and used as an alternative to traditional Fossil
fuels For cars, lorries and buses.

The use of CNG instead of petrol and diesel has significant

environmental advantages: compared with traditional Fuels,
CNG allows the reduction of CO, emissions by around 20%
(and up 100% if from biomethane), nitrogen oxides by
around 75% and fine particles by 97%. Strengthened by its
extensive pipeline network, which allows the transportation
of CNG with little impact on the environment and vehicular
traffic, Italy is already the market leader in Europe For the
consumption of methane for motor traffic, with over a billion
cubic metres consumed in 2019 and around one million
vehicles currently in circulation.

During the year, Snam ratified agreements and partnerships
with the aim of promoting sustainable mobility throughout
the country.

In 2019, Snam and the Spanish motor manufacturer SEAT
worked together since the agreement signed in 2018 For the
technological development and expansion of compressed
natural gas and biogas refuelling infrastructure For
sustainable development. This partnership involved Snam's
commitment to creating innovative infrastructures and the
development, by SEAT, of new models of vehicles running
on methane. The companies worked on development
opportunities For initiatives aimed at retailers, commercial
customers and motorists to promote the network of

natural gas refuelling stations and identify initiatives For

the technological development of biomethane. Specifically,
commissioned by the competent Ministries, Snam produced
a web tutorial For the implementation of the self-service
facilities dedicated to natural gas For motor transport.

This new partnership will develop Further the sustainable
mobility with natural gas and biomethane, both in Italy

and throughout the continent, because it joins together
two European leaders: Snam in the creation of innovative
infrastructures and SEAT in the development of new
sustainable models.
As part of the promotion of sustainable development in
Italy, in 2019 Snam upgraded the existing infrastructure in
readiness For the development of the CNG and LNG markets.
