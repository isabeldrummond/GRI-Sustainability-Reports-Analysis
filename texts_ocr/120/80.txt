REMUNERATION POLICIES AND SYSTEMS

In Snam, merit is the basis of the administrative and reward practices, both in
terms of professional development and career opportunities. At the same time it is
a benchmark for people management to stick to fairness and sustainability criteria.
The remuneration systems are periodically updated based on the comparison

with the reference markets as well as taking into consideration information

from external stakeholders. In particular, these systems are meant to ensure the
recognition of the results achieved, the quality of the professional contribution
provided and individual development potential of the person.

Incentive schemes for the different corporate population
groups

EXECUTIVES

The remuneration system breaks down into two parts: a Fixed remuneration, with
possible annual adjustments For merit or progression of roles/responsibilities, and
a variable remuneration with incentives to promote professional contribution in
the short-term, by assigning an annual monetary incentive (IMA), as well as in the
medium-long-term, by assigning a long-term share-based incentive (ILT).
Claw-back mechanisms are also provided, to recover the variable portion if the
resulting compensation is not due because it was earned based on targets that
were attained as a result of malicious or grossly negligent behaviour or that were
proven to be manifestly incorrect.

The Total Reward Statement, an information package on the breakdown of the
individual remuneration, guarantees the promotion and transparency of the
remuneration system.

NON-EXECUTIVE PERSONNEL

Snam adopts a short-term variable incentive system to reward the best
performances and young resources with a potential for development.

All companies in the Group anticipate a “Participation Bonus", instituted by the
National Collective Labour Agreement, based on the performance of profitability
and productivity parameters, measured in relation to the targets agreed upon
every year between the company and the trade-union representatives.
