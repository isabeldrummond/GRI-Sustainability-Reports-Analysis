The strong correlation between human activity and global
warming is increasingly visible and confirmed in the latest
report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), which highlights an increase in current average global
emperatures of around 1°C compared with pre-industrial
levels, and 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052. The trend is
obvious if you consider that, on analysing the average
emperatures recorded from the 80s until now, every
decade has been warmer than the previous one and the last
en years have been by far the hottest in history. The rise in
emperatures will continue for centuries, causing complex
changes in the climate system, such as the rise in sea levels,
extreme phenomena, droughts, heavy rainfall, with risks
and impact levels that differ according to the geographical
location, vulnerability, levels of development and adaptation
policies, resilience and mitigation of individual countries.

This is the cry of alarm that the international community
launched at the UN conference on climate change, known
as COP25, inaugurated in Madrid on 2 December 2019. In
anticipation of the crucial 2020 deadlines established in the
Paris Agreement, the leaders Focused global attention on
he climate emergency and the urgent need to significantly
extend arrangements to achieve the three main climate
goals: reduce emissions by 45% by 2030; achieve climate
neutrality by 2050 and stabilise the increase in global
warming to within 1.5° C.

The data and estimates of the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO), highlight the difficulties in achieving
these international targets. In 2018 global atmospheric

concentrations of greater greenhouse gases (carbon
dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxide) reached record levels.
Specifically, CO, reached 407.8+0.1 parts per million, an
amount equal to 147% compared with pre-industrial levels.
In order to reach the emission reduction targets outlined in
the Paris Agreement and suggested by organisations that
are experts on these issues, such as the IPCC and the IEA,
the European Union defined and expressed its commitment
within the framework of the Clean energy for all Europeans
Package by 2030 and the EU 2050 Climate Long-term
Strategy, which aim not only to reduce CO, emissions (-40%
by 2030 and -100% by 2050), but also increase the share of
energy produced from renewable sources (+32% by 2030)
and improve energy efficiency (+32.5% by 2030).

The greater ambition in the area of energy and climate was
widely accepted by the new EU Commission, which took
office on 1 December 2019, in its European Green Deal (a
document of a non-legislative nature). The EU Green Deal
summarises the collection of initiatives that the new EU
Commission intends to adopt during its term in office in
order to set out on the journey to climate neutrality by 2050.
Following the direction taken by the European Union, the
Italian government, like all EU countries, expressed its
commitment to curb global warming. The new "Proposed
Integrated National Plan for Energy and the Climate"
(PNIEC), published at the end of 2019, aims to chart a course
that makes the national energy system more competitive,
secure and sustainable, operating in line with the
decarbonisation targets defined at a European level.
