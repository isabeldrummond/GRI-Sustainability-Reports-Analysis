To safeguard the environment, in
2019 Snam spent around €114.4
million (€101 million on investments
and €13.4 million on management
costs).

 

Protecting the environment, biodiversity, and the territory are integral parts

in defining Snam's corporate policies and investment decisions. To guarantee

the efficient and transparent management of its environmental aspects, all of
Snam's activities are monitored by certified environmental management systems
(ISO 14001). In addition, Snam's commitment is also reflected in the challenging
targets of the new 2019-2023 Strategic Plan where the Company is committed to
reduce its methane emissions by 40% by 2025 (compared with the previous target
of 25%) and total Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO, equivalent emissions by 40% by 2030
compared with the 2016 figures.

Aware of the role that innovation and new clean energy sources have in achieving
the decarbonisation goals, Snam is investing in the development of innovative
solutions in its core activities and in the creation of new more sustainable business
lines related to energy efficiency, green gases, such as hydrogen, biomethane and
bio-LNG and to sustainable mobility.
