The biomethane has several benefits:

. tis the perfect example of a circular economy: both

in agriculture, in the agro-industrial Field, relating to

he management of organic Fraction of municipal solid

waste (FORSU), the biomethane is produced from
production waste and sub-products which once the
anaerobic digestion process is completed are used as
otally natural fertiliser capable of restoring the organic
and nutrient substances needed From the perspective
of a circular economy to the land;

. tis an efficient, Flexible and programmable energy

source: the presence of infrastructures like gas

ransportation and storage networks ensure that,
unlike other renewable energies, once injected into
he Snam network, the consumption of biomethane
can be modulated according to requirements without
additional investments;

. tis totally renewable and sustainable: biomethane,

in spite of being a gas, is actually considered a

neutral source from the perspective of greenhouse

gas emissions and is totally renewable because its

production takes place through the transformation

of waste and organic material that would produce

greenhouse gas emissions in any case.

For biomethane from agricultural sources, it is

recognised that carbon dioxide emissions produced

during combustion are equal to the quantity of carbon
dioxide absorbed by crops when they are growing,
making the process neutral from the point of view

of emissions. The process can go from "neutral"

o "negative" if the carbon dioxide produced and

separated during the biogas purification stage is

employed in industrial and/or Food uses. In addition,
he production of biomethane is not competitive to
he production of food and incentivising the use of

particular "second harvest" energy cultures makes

it possible to maintain an agricultural balance in the

existing economy;

. t creates value For local communities: biomethane

case be the source of a new local economy, creating

jobs, increasing tax revenues for local communities,
responding to the need to dispose of production waste
and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and,
hrough special cultivation techniques, it combats the
effects of desertification preserving and, sometimes,
replenishing specific nutrients in the soil;

. t minimises the costs of decarbonisation: not requiring
new investments in infrastructures and helping to
exploit waste and sub-products, biomethane becomes
a vital source For on Focusing National and European
objectives in terms of decarbonisation.

 

 

36 Sustainability Report 2019

A recent Ecofys study, promoted by the Gas for Climate

association, which Snam is a part of, estimated that

using renewable gas could lead to an overall saving

in Europe of around €140 billion per year by 2050,

compared with a scenario that doesn't involve the use

of biomethane.
Biomethane is therefore an energy resource that is ready to
meet European and global objectives for reducing emissions
exploiting existing gas networks and promoting an
economic model based on the sustainability and circularity
of the use of resources, with consequent positive effects on
the agri-food industry.

 

The Enersi project

In 2018 Snam launched an innovative project relating to

the recovery of organic fraction of municipal solid waste.

Through the subsidiary Snam4Mobility, For a price of around

€2 million it acquired 100% of Enersi Sicilia Srl, the company

that owns the licence authorisation for the development of

a biomethane and compost production infrastructure in the

province of Caltanissetta. The biomethane produced will be

injected into the network as a source of renewable energy,
while the compost will be used as a natural fertiliser in place
of chemical Fertiliser.

The works, which began in December 2018 and continued

throughout 2019, will be concluded by the middle of 2020

with the introduction of biomethane into the national

network.

The plant will be capable of recovering 36 thousand tonnes

per year of FORSU corresponding to around 3.2 million cubic

metres of biomethane, equal to 30 GWh of energy produced
each year.

The main advantages for the territory from this project are:

@ Newjobs and skills;

@ Economic return for local businesses that will be
involved in the construction phase and in supporting
and supplying the new plant;

@ Cost Saving for the citizenship in the transportation
of waste outside of the province and a consequent
reduction in emissions.
