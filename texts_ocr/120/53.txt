INNOVATION FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

The development of more efficient and sustainable technologies is of vital
importance in the reduction of the environmental impacts of a company. In
2019, various research and development activities launched in previous years
were either continued or completed. At the same time, some new projects were
launched with a potential impact on various areas of corporate operations. Many
of these projects have been conducted with the Snamtec (Tomorrow's Energy
Company).

—!, of the network and plants

Installation of innovative systems for controlling and monitoring the network and

facilities in the following areas:

@ Remote control: development of the Smart Tel project aimed at analysing
the requirements of data acquisition and management processes relating to
the control and running of the network, in particular:

- adoption of IlloT solutions (Industrial Internet of Things) for reporting field
data not available to date, for the diagnostics and operation of equipment
aimed at making the gas transportation network increasingly more smart
also defining supervision and maintenance logics that are appropriate and
optimised For all equipment (for example, predictive maintenance);

- study of preheating plant engineering solutions with automated
management aimed at optimising energy efficiency and reducing
emissions;

- rationalisation of transmission equipment in order to have standardised,
modular equipment to make the management and maintenance
processes for the actual equipment more efficient;

- creation of a repository with all the data to facilitate the maximum
integration and availability of validated data and the implementation of
Big Data and Advanced Analytics.

@ = Security:

- initiatives for protection against fire in plant control rooms through
vacuum technology. A project was later launched to install similar
fire detection/extinguishing systems in the technical rooms of the
compression stations.

- replacement of plant security management systems by installing
electronic systems with SIL certification (Safety Integrity Level)

@ Monitoring compression units: in 2019 a project was launched For the
modernisation of a telediagnostic system for the compression units through
the acquisition of thermodynamic and Functional parameters for the Future
development of predictive analysis aimed at improving performance.

In addition, in 2019 a project was completed for the development of a

dashboard that collects the main important parameters needed for dispatch

for the improved management of the turbochargers.

@ Electro-compressors: study for the introduction of electro-compressors at
storage sits.

@ Trigeneration: in 2019 works were completed to put high-efficiency
trigeneration plants into operation at the Gallese and Istrana compressor
stations. The start up of the system at the Gallese station took place in the
last quarter of 2019 achieving an energy saving of more than 65% with
further improvement margins Following the tuning in 2020.
