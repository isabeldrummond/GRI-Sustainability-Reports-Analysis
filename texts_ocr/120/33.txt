Conversely, the production of grey hydrogen, produced
from natural gas or coal, will see a rise in price resulting,
above all, From the increase in the cost of CO,, in line with
European and Italian decarbonisation targets.
Specifically, in Italy, the cost of green hydrogen could
already be competitive by 2030, ahead of other European

countries. Taking into consideration the good availability

of renewables in Italy, thanks to its geographical location
and weather conditions (e.g. good direct sunlight), green
hydrogen will reach parity with grey hydrogen 5-10 years
earlier than in other European Union member states such as,
for example, Germany.

Hydrogen, the first element in the periodic table is the most
abundant in the universe. It is a colourless, odourless gas
present, in combination with other elements in compounds
such as water, minerals, hydrocarbons and biological
molecules. It is very light, exactly 16 times lighter than
oxygen, can be stored, has a very high energy content per
unit mass and can be easily reproduced from different
energy sources, such as fossil Fuels (grey hydrogen) and
renewable energy sources (green hydrogen). The colours
grey and green refer to the different production sources
of hydrogen, respectively From natural gas or from oil and
electricity From renewable sources.

Grey hydrogen is mainly produced from natural gas. The
most common production process is called gas reforming
which consists of getting water vapour and natural gas

to react at high temperature. The consequent chemical
reaction produces hydrogen and leads to the emission of
CO, into the air, due to gas combustion For heating. The
production of hydrogen with a low environmental impact

rom fossil fuels could only be achieved in combination with
he capture, use (as an input for new hydrogen-based Fuels)
and storage of coal through the carbon capture, use and
storage technique (CCS). This technique makes it possible

o offset, in Full or in part, the CO, emissions from its
production. The hydrogen produced through the storage of
coal is defined as blue hydrogen.

Green hydrogen is produced from the electrolysis of water,
a process in which water is broken down into oxygen and
hydrogen with zero emissions. Thanks to the electrolysis
process, it is possible to produce hydrogen from electricity
and vice versa. Hydrogen, like electricity, is an energy vector.
What distinguishes hydrogen from electricity is the fact that
it is composed of molecules and not electrons. This means
hat it can be stored and transported and, if combined with
other elements, Forms so-called hydrogen-based fuels (e.g.
synthetic methane, ammonia) so that it can be used as an
energy source for various productive uses.
