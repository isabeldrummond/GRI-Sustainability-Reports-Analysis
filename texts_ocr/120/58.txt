Tep Energy Solution

In May 2018 Snam acquired a controlling share, equal to
82% of the share capital, of TEP Energy Solution (TEP),

one of the main Italian companies operating in the energy
efficiency sector.

TEP is an ESCo (Energy Service Company), accredited at
Gestore dei Sistemi Energetici S.p.A. (GSE), which is mainly
involved with energy requalification and deep renovation
operations for apartment buildings and industrial sites for
civil and service sector.

TEP also provides advisory services to support energy-
intensive businesses and large companies to identify

he actions necessary for the reduction of the energy
‘consumption and the environmental impact in relation to
heir corporate processes (carbon footprint and LCA, energy
iagnoses, energy management systems compliant with ISO
50001:2018).

In 2019, TEP market activities concentrated on various lines
of intervention, integrating energy efficiency solutions in
domestic, tertiary and industrial sectors.

Apartment blocks - integrated solution called “CasaMia”
The company offers energy diagnostic services For the

esign and realisation of interventions with innovative
lutions (modernisation of thermal power stations,
construction of thermal walls, improvement of seismic class,
etc.) that make it possible to guarantee the heating and
climate control requirements and needs are met at the same
time reducing consumption and CO, emissions. In 2019 29
interventions were carried out which led to a reduction in
CO, emissions of around 765 tonnes/year.

“Mosaico Verde” (Green Patchwork) Campaign

The company joined the national reforestation campaign
promoted by Legambiente and AzzeroCO,,. Under the scope
of this initiative, in 2019 TEP created the first urban wood

in Padua by planting 1,000 new native trees (linden, oak,
Field maple and Guelder-rose) in an urban area that was
previously grassland.

The goal is to create a green lung to curb atmospheric and
acoustic pollution, absorb CO, emissions (by around 20
tonnes per year) and improve the quality of life of the area,
with a recreational area For residents and children in the
nearby schools.

Industrial and tertiary sector - ESCO energy efficiency
interventions

The Company carries out operations that involve the
adoption of efficient technologies for reducing the
environmental impact of production activities and
processes, with the guarantee of achieving the savings
estimated in the design stage. The interventions mainly
relate to the utilities (thermal power stations, lighting,
cogeneration, purification, environmental climate control)
with savings main in thermal energy. In 2019, 3 new plants
were built which, together with the 5 plants constructed
previously and managed by TEP, has led to an overall
reduction of CO, emissions into the atmosphere of around
1,050 tonnes/year.

Energy Efficiency Certificates TEE (so-called White
Certificates)

TEEs are incentives recognised by the GSE for energy
efficiency actions where the savings actually achieved

can be measured and reported. TEP supports customers,
mainly in the industrial sector, with the management of
projects For recognising these certificates and For the
subsequent calculation of savings to report to the GSE. In
2019 59,612 TEEs were produced. The TEEs produced in
the year, counting the production activities and processes
of end users, certify a reduction in CO, emissions of around
134,000 tonnes (83,000 for the reduction of thermal
consumption and 51,000 for the reduction of electricity
consumption) counted for the production activities and
processes of end users.
