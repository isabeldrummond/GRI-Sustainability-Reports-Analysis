The storage activities are managed
through the concession of nine
storage fields (in Lombardy, Emilia
Romagna and Abruzzo) made of
reservoirs, wells, pipelines,
treatment facilities and compression
plants. The storage of natural gas
consists of the injection of the gas
into the porous rock belonging to an
exhausted reservoir which was
previously filled with natural gas
itself, brining back the reservoir to its
original state in a certain way. Once
stored, the gas can be transported
and delivered, allowing to
compensate the difference between
the gas supply and demand, ensuring
continuity in the gas provision.
