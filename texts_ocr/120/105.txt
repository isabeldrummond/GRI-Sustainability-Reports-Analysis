BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MANAGEMENT

Business activities are managed in accordance with the organisational and
procedural system applied across all Snam Group companies in Italy and abroad,
created to ensure that the system of rules governing the business is clear, simple
and organic.

In this context, and in line with its business model, Snam adheres to the UN Global
Compact, the most important international sustainable development initiative,
which aims to promote and disseminate ten global ethical principles concerning
human rights, environmental protection, workers’ rights and anti-corruption.
These principles come from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
International Labour Organisation Declaration on the fundamental principles and
rights to work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and, lastly,
the United Nations Convention against Corruption.

Of fundamental importance for the smooth operation of the organisational
system is the allocation of specific objectives to each position of responsibility
and on the transparent assessment of results, thereby enabling continual
improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of corporate processes.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The Board of Directors is the central body of the Snam’s corporate governance
system and is vested with the broadest powers for the ordinary and extraordinary
management of the Company. The Board of Directors currently in office,
appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting of April 2 2019, is composed of nine
directors who will remain in office For a period of three years. The Board of
