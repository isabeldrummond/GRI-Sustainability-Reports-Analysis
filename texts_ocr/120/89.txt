The supply chain

A CLEAR VISION FOR THE SUPPLY CHAIN

Snam founded its development model on sustainable growth and the
dissemination of respecting environmental, social and economic aspects, turning
them into an integral part of its strategic decisions. Given the plurality of the
activities carried out, careful management of the supply chain is an essential
element of this model. Identifying and recognising new suppliers in line with

this vision and encouraging historical suppliers to commit to actions that go
beyond complying with efficiency and quality requirements, but which lead to
advantages for the environment and society, is the right route For setting an
example and being an important point of reference along the entire supply chain.
