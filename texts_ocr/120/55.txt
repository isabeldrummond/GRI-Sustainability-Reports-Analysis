Protecting the climate
and the air

Snam's management of the environmental aspects aims to protect the climate
and the air, in line with the Company's commitment to a sustainable energy
transition. By its nature, the natural gas, Snam's core business, offers an energy
solution that has Far less of an impact compared with traditional fossil fuels
such as diesel and oil, facilitating the domestic and European journey towards
decarbonisation.

 

In the 2019-2023 Strategic Plan, Snam has reinforced its objectives, increasing
the target previously set for reducing its methane emissions by 2025, going from
-25% to -40% compared with the 2016 figures, through a reduction in emissions
from LNG transportation, storage and regasification activities. An investment plan
was implemented to reach these targets that makes it possible to maintain and
develop natural gas recovery programmes from maintenance activities by 33%
every year until 2022. Snam has also established an ambitious climate altering
emissions reduction plan, setting a target of a -40% by 2030, compared with the
2016 values for (Scope 1) direct CO,eq emissions and (Scope 2) indirect emissions
from energy use, including through the definition of a new target related to the
use of green electricity by 2030.
