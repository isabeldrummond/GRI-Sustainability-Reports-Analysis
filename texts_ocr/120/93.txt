Performance monitoring

Snam is committed to involve its suppliers in pursuing its objectives and
integrating them in their business model, by constantly monitoring and checking
performance and requirements.

The monitoring of performance, inspection visits and evaluation processes, are
the main tools used to protect the integrity of the supply chain and to ensure
that the expected quality and efficiency standards are maintained. 937 feedbacks
were collected during the year (+14% compared to 2018) about the performance
of 117 suppliers and 3959 checks on the taxpaying of 1913 suppliers and sub-
contractors were carried out (irregularities were detected in the 2,3% of the
examined cases).

To evaluate the performance of suppliers, Snam uses a rating index (IR) that takes
into consideration the compliance to the technical contractual requirements
(Quality), the health-safety-environment features (HSE), the agreed delivery times
(Level of service) and the ability to establish a good relationship with customers
For the entire duration of the contract (behaviour). The evaluation is periodically
sent to suppliers in the Form of analytical ratings defined on the following
evaluation scale: poor, inadequate, adequate, good, excellent. In 2019, the rating
“excellent” increased by 4 percentage points, which proves the effectiveness of
sharing the Snam's know-how and best practices along the entire supply chain.

Snam may restrict, suspend or even revoke the qualification of a supplier who fails
to meet the agreed standards. Some examples could be a supplier Failing to meet
the technical-organisational requirements, a negative performance of a supplier
or its subcontractors, the non-compliance with the provisions on taxpaying and
the rules of the Snam Code of Ethics. In 2019, 41 measures were adopted (+17%
compared to 2018).
