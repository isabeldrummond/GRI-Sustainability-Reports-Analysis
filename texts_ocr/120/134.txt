Conclusions
Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
Sustainability Report of Snam Group as of 31 December 2019 has not been prepared, in all material

respects, in compliance with the GRI Standards as disclosed in the paragraph “Methodological Note”
of the Report.
