Interview with

Mark Zoback

 

Mark Zoback is a geophysic professor and director of the
“Stanford Natural Gas Initiative” at Standford University,
he is also co- director of the “Stanford Center for Induced
and Triggered Seismicity (SCITS)” and of the“Stanford
Center for Carbon Storage (SCCS)”. He is author to more
than 300 articles and books, he also holds five patents and
received several academic and institutional awards such as
the’”Outstanding Contribution to the Public Understanding
of the Geosciences Award” from the “American Geological
Institute” in 2016.

Hydrogen technologies have experienced a great deal of interest
in both academic research and commercial communities over the
last Few years, primarily as an option for deep decarbonization
of the transportation and power sectors. While the applications
and pathways to commercialization have more clarity (and
promise) than in previous periods of interest in hydrogen, recent
improvements in cost and performance point to economic
viability. Hydrogen appears to be on the cusp of a step change
in technology developments, cost reduction and especially
public acceptance. It is also seeing relatively small-scale success
in several markets such as fork lift trucks being used in indoor
warehouses and home hydrogen fuel cells For electrical power
back-up. In general, widespread utilization of hydrogen across
many sectors suggests a potential for synergy and scaling.

Which role do you foresee for hydrogen as a fuel for the
decarbonization of the current and future energy scenarios?
In the context of areas where hydrogen is able to uniquely Fit as
a critical energy source in a largely decarbonized energy world,
heavy-duty transportation, primarily long-haul trucking, buses
and potentially Ferries/ships seems to stand out. For instance,

in the context of heavy-duty transportation, hydrogen is
particularly attractive because the refuelling time is significantly
shorter than for electric trucks and the range of 300-500 miles it
requires limited infrastructure to existing trucking routes. From
a business perspective, the introduction of a fleet of heavy-
duty vehicles will need to be coordinated with the build-out

of refuelling infrastructure and with appropriate policy and
regulatory reforms. Some sizeable, but limited applications (e.g.,
local port authorities utilizing large hydrogen fuel cell vehicles)
will be an important early-market and a valuable proving-ground
For eventual large-scale deployment of hydrogen-powered
vehicles.

Another market sector that could see significant increases
(pending technological developments and cost reduction) is as a
back-up storage/distribution mechanism for curtailed renewable
electricity (as an alternative to batteries) in the power sector. In
this application, electrolyzers seem like the most practical source
of hydrogen as it circumvents the need for carbon storage.

Development of this market will be dependent on the cost of
hydrogen generation (principally the cost of electrolyzers) but
also the development of local hydrogen storage facilities and, of
course, electricity. Blending hydrogen into the existing natural
gas pipeline infrastructure is extremely attractive as a low-cost
option to help decarbonize the natural gas system, particularly
for heating. There are concerns about the ability for the natural
gas pipeline system to accommodate hydrogen, but many of
these should be resolvable in a few years.

Which is the role that both the key players such as companies
operating in the energy industry and the final customers can
play in these scenarios?

Companies will need to demonstrate that required technologies
are available for deployment and develop business models and
markets. Thirteen large international corporations recently
Formed the Hydrogen Council to create alignment on the

use of hydrogen for the energy transition. Companies, and
governments for that matter, are at risk of burning billions of
dollars in pursuit of widespread hydrogen implementation if it
is not done in a systematic and integrated manner. Companies
should be strategic in their vision For low-carbon hydrogen and
Focus investments in hydrogen in cases where other cheaper and
more established technologies cannot be deployed. Hence, the
emphasis on heavy-duty transportation discussed above. There
is certainly a lot of hype about “the new hydrogen economy”. It
is somewhat reminiscent of the hype surrounding the internet.
Yes, the internet has revolutionized commerce, entertainment,
etc. but only after a period in which there were spectacular and
costly Failures such as when the dot-com bubble burst in the late
1990's.

How important is the technologic innovation and R&D for the
development of hydrogen at scale?

Widespread use of hydrogen would greatly benefit From
technological improvements and cost reductions associated
with technologies (such as electrolyzers) that would be able to
operate over a wide range of scales.

Can hydrogen play a key role in the growth of developing
countries?

The use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in many of the mega-cities
of the developing world would be of tremendous benefit. In
densely populated areas, grid-based electricity principally comes
from coal-fired power plants. It may be most reasonable to
transition from coal to natural gas before renewable sources for
power generation because of the scale at which electricity needs
to be supplied in the megacities of the developing world. This
said, a major issue affecting electrical power in the developing
world is its unreliability. Hence, in much of the developing world,
nearly all middle-to-upper class consumers and small businesses
have back-up sources of electrical power — usually diesel-
powered generators. While one could use much cleaner natural
gas-powered generators, another option is to generate and
store hydrogen through electrolysis and use fuel cells to deal
with electrical power intermittency. However, this will require a
substantial decrease in the capital cost of electrolyzers (as well
as the overall system cost). If the system cost For hydrogen fuel
cells is substantially more than diesel- or gas-fired generators,
it may be difficult to establish this market in much of the
developing world.
