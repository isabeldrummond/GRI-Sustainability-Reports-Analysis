 

The dispatching centre

Dispatching involves the monitoring and remote control of transportation,
receiving data From around 3,800 plants located throughout Italy, 1,600 of which
are remotely controlled.

With the use of specific software applications, the information collected allows,
even on the basis of historic consumption data and climate condition forecasts,
the Formulation of short-term Forecasts for redelivery demand and the simulation
and optimisation of gas flows in the network, guaranteeing the best arrangement
of the compression systems to reduce their consumption and curb emission levels.
Network activities and the physical balancing of the system are constantly
guaranteed by an operating room functioning 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
based on the programming defined by customers and in conjunction with the
operators of Foreign infrastructures connected to the Italian network, ensures the
correct movement of the gas from the injection points to the withdrawal points.
The dispatching centre remotely controls over 9 storage facilities, planning and
carrying out surface treatment, well area and compression activities, guaranteeing
secure execution in any operating conditions, routine or abnormal.

THE PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY

Once the installation phase of the pipeline is completed, the Company launches
a series of operations aimed at restoring the pre-existing vegetable and
morphological conditions, guaranteeing the stability and natural balance of the
surrounding habitat and promoting the biological Functionality of the area. This
commitment is explained through the launch of a plan for at least Fifteen years
of reforestation, care and maintenance of plants and shrubs following by an
environmental monitoring phase of the surrounding natural area, comparing the
conditions after restoration with the original conditions.

The Natura 2000 sites are the main instrument used by the European Union's
policy for preserving biodiversity. Established pursuant to the Habitat Directive
92/43/CEE for preserving the natural habitats in the EU, the Natura 2000 network
is composed of Sites of Community Interest (SCI), Special Areas of Conservation
(SAC) and Special Protection Areas (SPA). In 2019 the SCI IT 9350136 “Vallata dello
Stilaro” in Calabria was affected by Snam's activities, For a total distance of 3.7 km,
following the construction of the “Sant’ Andrea Apostolo dello lonio - Caulonia”
pipeline and associated works.
