REPORTING PROCESS AND METHODS

The process of gathering data and information and
preparing the report was coordinated and managed by

he Sustainability unit of the parent company, Snam, in
cooperation with the various corporate functions and
operating companies. The publication of the document, at
he same time as the Annual Report, takes place after the
approval of the Snam Board of Directors on 18 March 2020.
The economic and Financial, operating and governance data
was taken directly from the Annual Report and from the
Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure.

aspects addressed in the document were gathered from the
process owners.

The calculation methods used for determining the indicators
are given in the specific reference paragraphs. To ensure

he comparability over time of the indicators deemed most
significant and to give the reader the chance to compare

he performance achieved, current values have been placed
alongside those for the previous two years, using graphs and
ables. We have tried within this document to place equal
emphasis on positive and negative aspects, providing, where
deemed appropriate, a comment on the results achieved,
including the Facts and events that the Company was
involved with in 2019.
