 

During the year and in the
transportation sector alone, 99
meetings were held with local
administrations and associations
to illustrate works projects. Eight
agreements were concluded
with these associations regarding

INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY

During the design of the network, Snam takes into account aspects related to
transportation and infrastructure security, the technical and economic feasibility
of the works and their environmental impact. In addition, great importance is

also attributed to the inclusion of the wo

landscape equilibrium with the visual and natural impact kept to a minimum.
Advanced procedures and technologies were adopted in the realisation of the
works which, subject to technical and economic Feasibility, minimise the impact on

the environment as Far as possible. Wher

For checking networks and systems is evidence of the Snam's commitment to
making its infrastructures increasingly more secure and efficient: with this in mind,
in 2019, Snam launched the first trial of a long-distance civil Flight of a remote-
control operated drone for monitoring the network. Snam also uses smart pigs to
check and inspect the pipelines; these are smart devices equipped with sensors
which, travelling inside the pipelines, can detect the presence of any defects or
irregularities in the material or the minimal movement of the pipes. Geological
inspections were also conducted and any land slippage at specific points of the
route kept in check with the help of real time data collection systems that use
aspecific remote detection method, interferometric satellite SAR and CGPS
stations.

Snam continuously monitors and checks the storage facilities through detection
systems that automatically activate the security system as needed. The most
frequently used systems are: explosive mixture detectors, fire detectors, smoke
detectors, high or low pressure switches, pressure transmitters, Fuse plug
systems and heat sensitive cables, sound-level meters for detecting gas leaks and

 

extinguisher systems.
