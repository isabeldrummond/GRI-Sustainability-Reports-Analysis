Green energy
vectors

Looking at the current situation, there's an urgent need

to intensify efforts to reach the European and national
decarbonisation targets. An energy system where

natural gas and energy vectors obtained from renewable
sources coexist is presently the only possible solution for
international, and especially national energy transition. For
this reason, domestic and European policies are aligning
themselves concerning the essential role of green gases as
the solution For decarbonisation in the medium-long-term.
Specifically, the combination of hydrogen, biomethane and
alternative forms of gas storage and transportation (through
Compressed Natural Gas and Liquefied Natural Gas) will
make it possible to respond to the energy requirements of
the most critical sectors, using the existing infrastructures
and resources in Italy. Snam, in line with national energy
strategies, is positioned as a vehicle for this transition,
through research, investments and collaborations aimed at
the development of green energy vectors in Italy.

The circularity of
biomethane

Biomethane is a renewable, Flexible, efficient and
programmable source, can be transported in existing
transportation and storage infrastructures, and integrates
perfectly and in a totally complementary way with other
renewable sources such as solar and wind power.

It is obtained, in dedicated facilities, from the anaerobic
digestion of both agricultural sub-products (dedicated crops,
agricultural sub-products and waste and animal waste), and
agro-industrial sub-products (production waste from the
food chain) and organic Fraction of municipal solid waste
(FORSU) through a biogas purification process.
Biomethane can already be injected into the existing
infrastructure network and used in all sectors in which gas
is employed to produce heat, electricity, or directly as a Fuel
in motor vehicles. Precisely as it is a renewable energy, on

2 March 2018, the Italian government issued a Ministerial
Decree that incentivises the use of biomethane as a fuel For
motor transport.
