INDIRECT CO,,, ENERGY EMISSIONS
(SCOPE 2)

Indirect energy CO,,, emissions are due to the procurement
of electricity and heat produced by third parties and used by
Snam For its activities. Indirect emissions are calculated both
through the Market Based approach (MB), which allocates a
zero CO,,, emission factor for the energy consumption from
certified renewable sources, and a Location Based approach
(LB), that considers an average CO... emission Factor for the
national electricity grid.

Electricity consumption, equal to around 117,380 MWh,
increased by 12% compared to 2018. Specifically, the
increased consumption is due to the LNG regasification
Facility, which, in 2019, regasified a greater quantity of gas,
and the Digital Transformation and Technology (DT&T)
activities For the redistribution and movement of the

data centres. The greater consumption resulting from the
LNG site was completely neutralised in terms of Scope 2
emissions thanks to the procurement of green electricity,
while the emissions due to the greater consumption
recorded on the other sites were partly mitigated by a new
gas power plant switching to an electricity power plant
certified as renewable on the Enna site. This plant joins those
of Messina and Terranuova B. (SRG), Brugherio (STG), the
Panigaglia LNG Plant and several areas of Snam4Mobility.
CO,,, emissions calculated according to the MB method
stood at around 32 thousand tonnes, in line with 2018 in
spite of an increase in total electricity and heat consumption
of 13% if calculated using the LB method, evidence of the
continuous increase in energy produced from renewable
sources.

Indirect GHG emissions

Green electricity/Electricity

Specifically, the ratio between the use of electricity
produced from renewable sources and total electricity
consumption increased further going from 37% in 2018
to 44% in 2019, thereby preventing the emission into the
atmosphere of around 16,100 tonnes of CO, (+ 4,000 t
compared to 2018).

OTHER INDIRECT CO,,, EMISSIONS
(SCOPE 3)

Indirect CO,,, emissions stood at approximately 538
thousand tonnes, a 22.8% increase compared to 2018
Following an increase in procurement and the different
nature of the supplied materials and goods. This category of
emissions stems around 99% from the supply chain and the
remaining share is due to employees’ business travels.
Further initiatives are ongoing and aimed at promoting a
culture of energy saving and minimising indirect emissions
associated with Snam's activities: the adoption of green
Procurement criteria for goods and services, sustainable
mobility initiatives and the implementation of initiatives

For energy savings directed at employees (company shuttle
services, public transport subsidies, smart working and the
use of video-conferencing for meetings) and the launch

of the supply chain CDP programme are just some of the
initiatives in progress that contribute to the reduction of this
type of emissions.
