Snam and the hydrogen

Snam is strongly committed to energy transition, with investments of €1.4 billion
planned For the Snamtec project (Tomorrow's Energy Company) intended to
improve energy efficiency and curb emissions, as well as innovation and new
green activities such as sustainable mobility and green gases, which come under
the hydrogen research and development initiatives.

From a system perspective, Snam takes part in many institutional and association

round table discussions dedicated to hydrogen nationally and internationally. In

particular:

+ in Italy, Snam is a member of the HS2IT association - the Italian Association of
Hydrogen and Fuel Cells;

* in Europe, Snam joined the Hydrogen Initiative, a statement signed by
businesses and governments to support hydrogen and its wide potential
as a sustainable technology for the decarbonisation and long-term energy
security of the European Union, and it belongs to the HYREADY network,
which includes important European players committed to cooperate to
make the existing transportation networks compatible with the injection of
increasing percentages of hydrogen;

+ globally, on 15 January 2020, Snam, together with the other 21 new
members, officially joined The Hydrogen Council, an initiative launched in
2017 at the World Economic Forum in Davos to create a coalition of leading
businesses in their respective sectors committed to accelerating investments
in hydrogen.

Snam also collaborates with the Bruno Kessler Foundation, which carried

out research into technologies intended to revolutionise the production of

decarbonised hydrogen in the near Future, making it an integral part of the long-

term solution for a carbon neutral energy system.

To give shape to the results of the studies and research conducted nationally and

internationally in the Field of hydrogen, Snam has created a new business unit

dedicated to hydrogen, with the goal of evaluating possible pilot projects and
contributing to the development of the supply chain. Alongside this, studies will
continue into the adaptation of compression and storage infrastructures and the
role of hydrogen in the Future energy system also with a view to collaboration
between various sectors (sector coupling), such as, for example, electricity and gas.

Specifically, in April 2019, Snam trialled the introduction of a mixture of

5% hydrogen and natural gas into its transmission network, replicating the

experiment in December, in the same section of the network, with 10% hydrogen.

The trial, the First in Europe, took place successfully in Contursi Terme, in the

Province of Salerno, and led to the supply, for around a month, of H2NG (a

mixture of hydrogen and gas) to two industrial businesses in the area, a pasta

making factory and a company that bottles mineral water. The initiative gained
international attention, with dedicated articles by Bloomberg (which wrote it was
the "First pasta" cooked with hydrogen) and in the Financial Times (which called it

a historic milestone).

By applying the percentage of 10% hydrogen to the total gas transported
annually by Snam, it would be possible to inject 7 billion cubic metres per year, a
quantity equivalent to the annual consumption of 3 million households and this
would enable a reduction of 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, corresponding to
the total emissions of all cars in a region like Campania. Now, Snam is committed
to checking that its assets are fully compatible with the increasing quantities of
hydrogen mixed with natural gas, as well as to research into the production of
hydrogen from renewable electricity.
