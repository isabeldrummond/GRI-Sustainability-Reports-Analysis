Among the scenarios taken into
consideration by Snam and the
studies conducted by organisations
and companies that are experts

in the energy sector, green gases,
such as hydrogen and biomethane,
are getting ready to be the key
solutions supporting the national
and international energy transition,
being able to contribute, through
their development and use, to
achieving the challenging goals of
reducing emissions in the long-term.

Snam's objectives

At the end of November 2019, Snam launched the new Strategic Plan for the
period 2019-2023, which traces the route that will enable the Company to tackle
the challenges associated with climate change and to contribute to the reduction
of emissions, minimising the increase in the global temperature and cut down
energy costs for end users. Snam believes in the potential of hydrogen as a clean
energy source and takes the view that injecting it into the gas networks could
contribute to the development of its production from renewable sources, keeping
down costs.

Snam's sustainability activities and projects are aimed at reducing greenhouse gas
emissions, in line with European and domestic decarbonisation goals.

Overall, Snam has set itself the target of reducing Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2
(indirect) CO, equivalent emissions by 40% by 2030 (with a base of 2016), equal to
around 1.5 million tonnes of CO, equivalent, to Fight climate change in line with
global objectives.

Specifically, Snam is committed to reducing its CH, emissions by 40% by 2025
(with a base of 2016) compared with the 25% target in the previous plan. This
target will be achieved through the application of a campaign for identifying and
repairing methane leaks (Leak Detection and Repair), the maximum replacement
of network and power plant components and the adoption of the best
technologies available.

In addition, Snam is committed to a 40% reduction in direct CO, emissions by
2030 thanks to the launch of the conversion of six gas-electric hybrid power plants
which will also contribute to the flexibility of the electric system and to energy
efficiency actions at buildings. To achieve the overall target of 40%, Snam also
plans a 40% reduction by 2030 of CO, generated From electricity consumption
thanks to greater recourse to solar power.
