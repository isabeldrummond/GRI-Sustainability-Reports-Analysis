Regulation in Italy

Tariff regulation is an essential element capable of developing the infrastructure

capital From an economic perspective, necessary to direct investments to the

network. To date, the 96% of Snam revenues are from regulated activities.

Snam interacts actively with the Italian Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks

and the Environment (ARERA) as Follows:

* responding, directly or through trade associations, to public consultations
that the Authority holds in relation to the various activities of the industry,
in preparation to define new standards or to review the standards in Force;

* participating to the technical round tables established by the Authority,
regarding the development of the regulatory framework;

¢ drafting amendments to the Transportation, Storage, and Regasification
Network Codes, subsequently submitted to the Authority For approval;

* participating to the collection of data and to the investigations carried
out during the year to assess the state of the industry or of the individual
services and to periodically send the data requested in compliance with the
reporting obligations.

In 2019, Snam contributed to the development of the regulatory system by
providing the Authority with several contributions and proposals. Specifically,
he activity involved the definition of tariff criteria and the quality of the
ransportation, storage and regasification services For the Fifth regulatory
period, both as part of the public consultation processes and through

specific meetings. In this context, given Snam's role in the country's journey

‘0 decarbonisation, the innovative use of the transportation network and
echnologies for the integration of renewable gases (such as, For example,
biomethane and hydrogen) were being closely examined. From a perspective of
he development of the regulatory system with arrangements that introduce
cost/benefit analyses (output based), Snam has developed a cost/benefit
analysis methodology, through a process open to the participation of all the
stakeholders involved, for new investments in transportation infrastructure,
ater approved by the Regulator. A monitoring report was also prepared For

he Authority on the status of the existing infrastructures in order to consider
appropriate incentivisation mechanisms for keeping fully depreciated assets in
operation. In 2019, the inclusion of the new gas settlement framework, in force
From January 2020, was also completed.

Regarding the services offered, new storage products and new market-based
regasification capacity allocation methods For LNG terminals have been
introduced aiming at meeting and supporting the ever increasing needs For
lexibility For infrastructure users. Lastly, Snam contributed to the total redesign
of the settlement arrangements to promote a better allocation of the quantities
of energy withdrawn From the network by its customers.
