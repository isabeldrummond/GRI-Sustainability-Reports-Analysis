Among the various initiatives planned,
note, by way of example, the Future
adoption of the European Climate
Law, aimed at defining the target

of climate neutrality by 2050 ina
binding manner in EU legislation.
There are also plans to publish a
specific plan aimed at improving the
goal of reducing emissions by 2030

to between 50% and 55% (compared
with the 1990 levels), with the
consequent need to reshape some of
the main EU legislative acts on energy
and climate (for example, the Emission
Trading System, Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy Directives).

Climate altering emissions are increasing, targets are not being met and there

is an urgent need to redefine global policies to curb the consequences of
climate change in the short, medium and long-term: this is the alarming scenario
outlined in recent years which, at the same time, represents one of the greatest
challenges in the history of humanity.

To mitigate these effects it will be necessary to develop an economic system
based on a progressive decarbonisation, gradually reducing the use of Fossil
Fuels, starting with the most polluting, such as, for example, coal, Focusing on
the use of more efficient energy in order to curb consumption and promote the
development and use of renewable and alternative energy sources.

For this reason, at the Paris Climate Conference (COP21) in December 2015, 195
countries adopted the first universal and legally binding agreement on climate

change at a global level. The agreement defines a global action plan to keep the
average annual global temperature increase to within 1.5% compared with pre-

industrial levels. The European Union formally ratified the
October 2016 and defined and expressed its commitment

example of the progressive phasing out of coal, but also and, above all, through
