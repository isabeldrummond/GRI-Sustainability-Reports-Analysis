The scenarios

By producing Forward-looking energy scenarios, Snam presents a vision of possible
developments of the Italian energy system in the medium-long-term (2030, 2040
and 2050) that takes into consideration the energy and environmental policy
guidelines nationally and at an EU level. Specifically, these scenarios are consistent
with the national renewable energy, emissions reduction and energy efficiency
targets to 2030 in the Integrated National Plan for Energy and Climate (PNIEC).

Snam scenarios

In order to develop a business strategy that is in line with the European and
national decarbonisation targets and with Snam's commitment to energy
transition, the company has developed medium-long-term energy scenarios:
the "Snam-Terna joint energy scenarios” to 2040, as a prerequisite for the
preparation of development plans for the transmission and transportation
networks, and the “Hydrogen potential” that evaluates the potential of
hydrogen in Italy to 2050 produced with the analytical support of McKinsey.

Snam-Terna joint energy scenarios

Snam developed the "Document describing the 2019 scenarios" in collaboration
with Terna, the operator that manages the electricity transmission networks

in Italy in conformity with resolutions 654/2017/R/EEL and 689/2017/R/GAS.
This study represents the result of the analyses conducted by Snam and Terma
to obtain a vision that is consistent with the possible Italian energy system
developments by 2040, a prerequisite For the preparation of the electricity and
gas sector transmission and transportation network development plans in Italy.

Scenario - “Hydrogen Potential”

Snam presented a study into the potential of hydrogen as an energy transition
vector in Italy at the "Hydrogen Challenge” event held on the 10th of October 2019
in Rome. The study analyses the potential of hydrogen in the Future for the national
energy system and highlights its key role in achieving the decarbonisation goals.
