@ Treatment systems: installation of latest generation,
high performance equipment with a low environmental
impact. The first installation of the new generators at
the Fiume Trieste facility is expected From 2020.

a

Creation of experimental projects and development of
specific collaborations aimed at guaranteeing the physical
integrity of the infrastructures in the Following areas:

@ Collaboration with the EPRG: it is ongoing the
collaboration with the EPRG (European Pipeline
Research Group, www.eprg.net), the association For
research into pipelines of which Snam is a member.

@ Protection against fire: installation of safety devices
that, in the case of accidental breakage or faults,
provide protection against the danger of pressurised
gas emissions during the accident scenarios in the case
of fire.

@ Micro-seismic monitoring: an innovative system
to protect plants against earthquakes composed of
accelerometers capable of instantly detecting seismic
events and activating the automatic plant safety systems.

Ve

Launch of trial projects For optimising and reinforcing
maintenance and checking activities For the transportation
networks in the following areas such as:

@ initiatives aimed at reducing emissions, with the
definition of all preparatory activities for the
implementation of an LDAR programme (Leak
Detection and Repair) for measuring and repairing leaks
in Snam plants.

@ = maintenance processes: continuation of the Smart
gas project aimed at improving the effectiveness of
technical and operational processes, for the purpose
of a comprehensive revision of the work processes and
regulations relating to corporate asset maintenance
activities. Specifically, the Smart LNG design and
realisation phase was launched in 2019 For operations
at the Panigaglia LNG terminal. The dematerialisation of
the archives in the regional units continued through the
eDoc document system which will be fully integrated in
Smart gas.

@ = leak detection: implementation of a system aimed at
locating gas leaks along the transport network, based
on the analysis of the pressure waves and the detection
of possible disruptions.

Physical integrity
of infrastructures

Maintenance and checking
of networks

@ = checks with flyovers: development of drone flight
infrastructure in BVLOS mode (Beyond Visual Line of
Sight).

) Gas metering

Development of innovative technologies and methodologies
for metering and controlling natural gas and related impact
in the Following areas:

Alternative instruments and quality measurement:

@ technological adaptation project with the installation
of quality analysers and the automation and remote
reading of the main measurement and reserve
measurement.

@ project for the installation of dew point H,O meters and
hydrogen sulphide analysers.

@ Estimating natural gas emissions: evaluation of
methods for estimating natural gas emissions and
research into the potential impacts, throughout the gas
supply chain, of chemical components present in traces
in biomethane is continuing in order to create the
conditions for its safe development in conjunction with
the European research group GERG (Groupe Européen
de Recherches Gaziéres, www.gerg.eu).

WW) New businesses

Creation of dedicated working parties to take an in-depth
look into issues related to the development of new
businesses with special reference to:

@ Innovative use of existing infrastructures: sharing of
information and expertise on the use of infrastructures
in relation to their capacity for transporting and storing
gases other than natural gas, including hydrogen:

The following initiatives were also examined under the
scope of European associations (Marcogaz):

@ Power 2 Gas: the process through which the electricity
produced by renewable sources that is surplus to
immediate consumption is transformed into hydrogen
to be injected directly into the network (limited to
the technically-acceptable quantities) or used For the
production of synthetic methane (SINGAS) also to be
injected into the network and possibly stored later.

@ = Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG): this is one of the latest
technological developments for the storage of natural
gas in tanks. The adsorption of natural gas in a porous
sorbent injected into a recipient (tank/canister) takes
place at ambient temperature and low pressure (25 -
35 bar).
