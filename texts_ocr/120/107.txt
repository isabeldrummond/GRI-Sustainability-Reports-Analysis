The fight against
corruption and illegality

The main internal regulatory reference for the Fight against corruption is the
Anti-corruption guideline that applies to Snam and its subsidiaries and is also
brought to the attention of the other investee companies in order to promote
principles and behaviours consistent with those expressed by the parent company.
The guideline takes its inspiration From the principles of ethics, transparency,
integrity and expertise already referred to in the Code of Ethics and also strives
for the continuous improvement of the awareness of Snam's people to recognise
corruption and any other type of fraud, as well as their responsiveness to play an
active role in the prevention, suppression or reporting of possible violations of
anti-corruption laws. The Anti-corruption guideline is consistent with the tenth
principle of the Global Compact, which rejects corruption "in all forms, including
extortion and bribes" and clearly outlines permitted and prohibited conduct. In
particular:

* itis prohibited to offer, promise, give, pay, authorise anyone to give or pay,
directly or indirectly, an economic or material benefit to a public or private
official (active corruption);

* itis prohibited to accept a request From, or solicitation from, or authorise
anyone to accept or solicit, directly or indirectly, an economic or material
benefit from anyone (passive corruption);

* it pays particular attention to the selection and qualification of suppliers, the
awarding of contracts, the management of contracts, the standard terms of
protection, including those of commitment to respect Anti-Corruption Laws
and to verify the ethical requirements of suppliers;

. it establishes that all of Snam's relations with, which refer to, or which involve
third-parties shall be conducted in Full compliance to the provisions of the
Anti-corruption guideline and the instrument therein.

The Anti-corruption guideline is part and parcel of a broader business ethics
control system adopted by Snam that aims to ensure the company’s compliance
with national and international laws and best standards. In this regard, Snam
provides specific training to make personnel aware and it carries out monitoring in
order to check the level of dissemination and knowledge.

To prevent the risk of corruption and fraud in general in the supply chain,

all suppliers and subcontractors are required to sign the Ethics and Integrity
Agreement that allows to carry out reputational analysis aimed at identifying -
based on public information - the possible risks of infiltration by organised crime.

In 2019, Snam worked with different bodies and organisations, including:
* the OECD taking part:
- inthe OECD Gobal Anti-Corruption and Integrity Forum, an event that

took place in March on “Tech for Trust: risks and opportunities of new
technologies for anti-corruption & integrity”, during which Snam was
invited to a select session on State Owned Enterprise, organised by
some of the representatives of the OECD Directorate of the Corporate
Governance & Corporate Finance Division, and aimed at gathering together
some of the Compliance & Anti-corruption Offices of some of the biggest
experts in the Field;
