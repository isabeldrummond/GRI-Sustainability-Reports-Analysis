GENDER EQUALITY IN CORPORATE BODIES

Gender equality, like other social and governance factors, is a vital element in the
creation of value for Snam.

On October 23 2019, the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting almost
unanimously approved (with a vote in Favour of more than 99%) the amendments
to Articles 13 and 20 of the by-laws in order to keep the provisions on the issue
of gender equality in the Company's boards and governing bodies in Force, as
well as in consideration of the disappearance of the effects of the Golfo-Mosca
Law. In this way, Snam voluntarily incorporates, at a statutory level, the criterion
of gender equality, so that at least one third of the Board of Directors and the
Board of Statutory Auditors are made up of the less represented gender. This
decision is in line with national and international best practices on the issue of
gender equality and with Snam's commitment to safeguard diversity and ensure
equal opportunities for all its employees.
