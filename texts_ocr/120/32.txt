The main advantages of green hydrogen and main applications on hard-to-abate sectors

   

— Can be stored reliably,
ae securely and conveniently

Aviation
In the aviation industry, in place oF
kerosene it is possible to use a zero
emissions hydrogen and reused CO2
based synfuel (i.e. captured in a CCS
[carbon capture and storage] plant).

&

Chemical production
Grey hydrogen, produced from natural
gas and used as a raw material in the
refining of petro-chemical products
and in the production of ammonia
could be replaced by green hydrogen
produced from renewable sources.

Does not produce COz,
or pollutant emissions

 

   

Can integrate non-programmable
renewable sources

Can decarbonise
“hard-to-abate” sectors

Shipping
In sea transport, hydrogen can be
used to produce ammonia, which
can replace oil For ship's engines
torunon.

o

Metal production
The reduction of the mineral iron with
hydrogen through the Direct Reduced Iron
(DRI) process, replacing the reaction of the
mineral with carbon in the blast Furnace,
represents one of the few zero carbon
emissions alternatives for steel production.

 

Can be transported cost
effectively, using existing gas
transportation networks

Heavy transport
Hydrogen can enable long-range buses
and lorries to become competitive in
terms of costs compared with the
vehicles running on diesel, electricity
and LNG currently in use.

i)

Heating
The mixture of hydrogen in the gas
transportation network can become
a competitive way of decarbonising
gas heating systems, especially in
historic city centres.
