A WORLD RUNNING ON GAS AND SNAM'S ROLE

>

Gas
Compression Plant

Natural gas is produced From the
anaerobic decomposition of organic
material. In nature it is Found in Fossil
state on its own or together with oil
and other hydrocarbons.

The main component of natural gas
is methane (CHz).

During combustion, most of the
methane gas is converted into steam
and carbon dioxide (CO2).

The regasification activities are
carried out through the
regasification plant in Panigaglia (La
Spezia), the first of its kind
developed in Italy, in 1971.
Regasification is the last one of the
activities in the liquified natural gas
chain (LNG) and it consists of
reverting the natural gas extracted
From the reservoirs to its original
state and after that, the gas is
liquified to a -160° C temperature to
allow its transportation on specific
carriers. In the gas system, the LNG
chain allows to diversify the gas
procurement sources.

LNG Carrier

Regarding transportation, natural gas
is taken over at the delivery points,
located on the importation lines
(Russia, Northern Europe and
Northern Africa), at the regassification
plants and at the production and
storage centers located in Italy.

Gas is therefore transported and
delivered at the redelivery points
connected to the distribution
networks and to the main industrial
and power generators plants.
