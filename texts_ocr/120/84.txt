INNOVATION IN THE COMPANY'S WELFARE
SYSTEM

The company's welfare system is a collection of
interventions, both monetary and in the form of services,
which increases the level of social protection and the
purchasing power of employees and which can indirectly
generate a positive impact on the corporate population.
From 2018 the Welfare Plan has been developed on a digital
platform called "Snammy" based on five areas: Family,
Education, Work/Life Balance, Well-being and leisure time,
Health. Five areas and 28 services (including corporate and
contractual) to meet the current needs and requirements of
he company.

Among the most interesting new features the “BE PARENTS”
programme stands out, an online training created in
partnership with “Life Based Value”, that accompanies new
parents during and after the birth of their child, to transfer
he skills acquired as parents to their work activities. In its
irst year 66 employees joined the programme (of which the
45% are women).

n the Family area there are the digital education courses

or parents and children on technological culture topics and
he “dediCARE” service which helps to resolve big and small
amily problems, from assisting old people to tutorials, to
babysitting.

n the Well-being and leisure time section, in addition to

he arrangements with leading health institutions and

 

prevention programmes, SNAMMYBENE continues, the
project is dedicated to the well-being of employees in its
various aspects: diet, cognitive-emotional and financial.
Regarding the Flexible working, the Smart Working
programme was extended both in terms of scope of
application and the number of hours, going from 62,930
hours in 2018 to 122,762 in 2019. This initiative is supported
by flexible working hours forcoming in and leaving the office
premises during normal working days, and "short Fridays",
where the working day can end from 13.00 onwards.

The “FLEXIBLE BENEFITS” system continued. It increases

he purchasing power of employees who join the initiative,
ransforming a share of the participation bonus (a maximum
of 60%) into welfare credit that can be used to buy services
supporting personal health, for school and for education,

or cultural and sports activities, for travel, mobility and
supplementary pensions for oneself or one's family. The
advantage of transforming part of the bonus into welfare
credit consists in the fact that there is no tax due on this sum
and the company awards to the employee a further bonus
that increases proportionally from 8% to 16% based on the
share converted.
