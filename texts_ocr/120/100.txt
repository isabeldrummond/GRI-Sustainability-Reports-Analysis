From May 22 2019 Snam opened a new digital commercial

platform (Jarvis) for its customers aimed at improving

commercial activities, developed in conjunction with market

operators.

The platform, actively involving customers, aims at updating

services and technologies supporting all transportation

storage and regasification commercial processes. It proposes

to encourage the offering of integrated services for the

Italian market enabling possible solutions for the foreign

market and it gives its customers the possibility of:

* viewing its active contracts and having access to the
documentation;

* accessing the transactions, in detail, For calculating the
balancing credit limit;

* independently managing their user profiles.

To facilitate the transition to the new platform, from July

2019, Snam launched a simulator of the new functionalities

that will gradually be released available to the market

operators.

Specifically, in September 2019, with the release of the
Trading PSV system for gas trading activities, the new
Jarvis platform came into force, at the same time as the
progressive shutting down of the functionalities in the PSV
system used previously.

At the end of the year the actions for releasing the
designation of supply from storage were finalised; in March
2020, on the other hand, the release of the functionalities
for managing the designation of injection in storage is
planned. In 2020, a Customer Relationship Management
(CRM) will be integrated on the digital platform and the
Commercial Excellence Programme (CEP) will be completed,
which breaks down into the development of three areas
dedicated to the Group's commercial personnel: “know-
how”, “behaviour” and “tools”.

The programme is intended to improve and guarantee the
Snam's competitive advantage in the long-term, supporting
the transition to commercial systems that operate
excellently.
