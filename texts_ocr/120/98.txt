Thanks to the development of the
Snam services over the last Fifteen
years, the Italian gas market has
seen a constant growth in the
transportation operators, from 30
in 2003 to around 210 in 2019, with
150 shippers.

In 2019, 123 connection contracts
were signed for the construction

of new delivery/redelivery points
(of which 26 were for biomethane
injection and 61 for the CNG Service
Areas) or the upgrading of existing
points.

One of the main activities of the
Control Room, working 24/7 to
oversee the Italian gas system, is
the balancing of the system which
has a dual purpose: physical and
commercial.

The physical balancing of the
system consists of the set of
operations through which the
Dispatching department of Snam
controls flow parameters (capacity
and pressure) in real time in order
‘oO ensure that gas can move safely
and efficiently From the injection
points to the withdrawal points all
he time.

The commercial balancing on

he other hand consists of the
activities required to correctly
schedule, account For and allocate
he transported gas, as well as the
Fee system that encourages users
‘0 maintain a balance between the
volumes they inject and withdraw
from the network.

 

THE BALANCING OF THE SYSTEM

In 2019, the integration process through which the commercial management
activities of the three businesses - transportation, storage and regasification -
merged into a single organisation continued, allowing the optimisation of the
processes within Snam.

The creation of a single Commercial Control Room for the management of daily
gas deliveries and movements, the balancing of the network (activities that define
Snam's responsibilities to the market), the integration of the know-how of the
three businesses managed by Snam, has led to an improvement in performance in
this area.

In detail, Snam daily receives the nominations of the transportation and storage
capacities From its customers. In confirming these requests, the Control Room
discharges, among other things, the specific disclosure obligations set out by

the Balancing Network Code (EU Regulation 312/2014), such as the hourly
publication on the Snam website of the information concerning the balancing
status of the system, as well as the publication, twice a day and for every shipper,
of information on the withdrawals measured during the gas day. The new
commercial Control Room pursues and facilitates the goal of improving the
quality of service provided to customers, also reducing management times. In

this way, customers which, according to the balancing regime in the Balancing
Network Code are responsible for the daily balancing of their positions, receive
adequate information to enable the evaluation of their status and potentially
undertake actions aimed at correcting their imbalances.

FLEXIBILITY AND DEFAULT SERVICES

To promote a greater operational Flexibility of the Italian gas system, the
possibility of booking transportation capacity on a monthly and a daily basis as
well as an annual basis was introduced at the redelivery points that supply gas
directly to the thermoelectric power plants, only paying For the quantities booked
and not the service For the entire thermal year. This type of access allows for
amore flexible allocation methods to respond promptly and efficiently to the
electrical system's changing operating conditions.

For the thermal year 2019-20 as well, Snam Rete Gas will perform the role of
Default Transport Provider with regard to retail companies and end users of its
network for which the balancing user responsible for the withdrawals cannot be
identified. The same service is also carried out For the sales companies and Final
customers at third-party transporters who explicitly requested it. In the thermal
year 2018-2019, this service involved 112 subjects among end users and retail
companies, For volumes of approximately 323,000 MWh.

 

In 2019, the allocations For storage capacities, like the transportation business,
were incorporated in the European PRISMA platform. This synergy helps customer
to use the sole platform for booking transportation and storage capacity and
makes Snam's storage capacity more transparent at a European level. Thanks

to Snam's ongoing commitment to meeting its customers different needs,

the Flexibility of the services offered, and constant, accurate information is
guaranteed through dedicated studies.
