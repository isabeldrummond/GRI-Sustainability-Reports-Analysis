5.6 WATER RESOURCE PROTECTION

For water discharged into the sewer the volumes are converted from meter reading, whereas for discharges handled as waste
CER 200304, they are taken from the MUD (single model of environmental declaration).

In PSC discharges, the presence of potentially hazardous substances may be recorded due to any industrial oil spills in Poprad
and GSI UK BS plants.

For all Italian plants the emission limits in water are defined on the basis of Legislative Decree 152/06, Table 3, Annex 5. For the
plant of Pernambuco, however, they are fixed with reference to CONAMA resolution number 430/201, while for GSI DE there is a
municipal regulation.

Other emission limits for the protection of water quality are set analytically in the cases of Prima Eastern and Prima
Components in Ferentino; according to the Integrated Environmental Authorization (AIA) for Sun oderzo and Sole Pontedera;
from the Environmental Authorization (AVA) for Prima Components Anagni and PSMM Campania. PSC did not report any non-
compliance incidents for discharge limits in 2018.
