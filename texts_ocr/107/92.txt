5.7 BIODIVERSITY

PSC establishments and sites are located in anthropized
areas and do not directly affect protected areas or the ones
having high biodiversity value, except for the case of the GSI
plant in Bergamo, which is about 1 km far away from the local
landmark “PLIS Monte Bastia” and has no impact on it.
