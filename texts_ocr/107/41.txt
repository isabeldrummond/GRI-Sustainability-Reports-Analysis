3.2 RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION

PSC has two centers dedicated to research and development
activities, to which investments are issued also in partnership with its
customers, one in Oderzo (59 employees) and the other one in Turin
(10 employees).

After PSC reorganization carried out in 2012, a Director was
appointed in the research and development area, who, in
collaboration with the Head of the Program Management, shall
coordinate three departments:

> Foreign customers
> FCA Group

> Appliances

With the purpose of identifying and sharing the best practices,
useful to the whole Group, a cutting-edge business-intelligence
platform has been realized.

PSC companies and business units have started several projects in
the research and development field.
