All the Material
Themes

 

The material themes have been
identified applying the principles for
the definition of the Report contents
and through the processes of
stakeholder engagement and
analysis of materiality described in
detail in the second chapter of the
Report of Sustainability, "Materiality
and methodology".

For every PSC material theme the
perimeter, within which the potential
impact can have an effect, has been
identified:

Within company boundaries: in this
case the impact mainly affects the
internal stakeholders

Outside the company boundaries:
in this case, the external stakeholders
are mainly affected by the impact

© Inside and outside the company
boundaries: the impact affects all
stakeholders.

In the management of material
themes, PSC considers both the
possible impact that can be directly
caused and the one that can indirectly
derive from his work.

developed on these lines. In the industrial plan, the strategic guidelines are: competitiveness, technological innovation and
localization. At the Business Unit level and, with a trickle-down effect, for each production site, the activities in line with the strategic
guidelines of the PSC are defined according to the following logical process: analysis of the business plan, S.W.O.T. analysis to
determine strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities and risks, risk assessment and definition of the operational plan.
