4.3 HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK

PSC companies take steps to ensure that both employees and collaborators, either belonging to the company or
subcontractors, follow the accident prevention regulations as well as hygiene and health protection in the workplace. They also
work to consolidate and spread a culture of safety, developing risk awareness and promoting responsible behaviour on behalf
of all employees and collaborators, in order to preserve their physical integrity.

All employees in Italy have contracts that adhere to the three different types of CCNL (National Collective Labor Agreements):
Rubber and plastic

Metal working
Employees are protected by national agreements and also concern the plants abroad

All Italian plants comply with Legislative Decree 81/08 by filling out the DVR form (Risk Assessment Document), general and for
specific risks. In this respect, hierarchical principles for risk assessment and prevention are followed as below:

Elimination of risk at source

Replacement of what is dangerous with what is safer or less risky
Development of large technical systems for risks protectio
Establishment of procedure and work instructions

Spread of safety signs

Personal safety protection devices (DPI) development

The employer, with the support of RSPP and a competent doctor, of RSL, as well as managers and supervisors, shall be
responsible for the operational process.

The results of the risk assessment procedure will be useful in developing improvement measures, included in the Business
Improvement Plan, to be applied on a regular basis.

Italian workers can report any perceived risk anonymously, in order to avoid repercussions, by using RSL mediation, which will
inform the employer.
