3.4 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS

PSC is committed to providing quality of products and services, which can meet or even exceed customer's expectations.
New plants subjected to constant maintenance, combined with state-of-the-art control systems, contribute to monitoring and
repeatability of processes, as well as improving the products quality. In case of unmanageable situations, they are monitored
through statistical studies that affect the main variables, so to allow an immediate intervention and restoration.

Each site monitors customer satisfaction. The resulting reports are analyzed by both business units and the Group holding
company. This process aims to ensure that attention is always focused on customer's needs.

In the development phase of each new product, its impact on the main environmental and safety aspects, according to the
precautionary approach, is assessed through the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), a priority risk assessment index,
based on three factors: severity, probability and detection.

The same process is used to assess other aspects of the product that may be relevant to the customers, for example those
related to functionality, aesthetics and assembly properties.

All the finished products supplied on the market are registered on IMDS System (International Material Data System), where
all the materials used for production are collected, updated, analyzed and archived. All substances and mixtures used in
the production phase, are accompanied by Safety Data Sheet (SDS) with information on physic-chemical, toxicological and
environmental hazard properties, necessary for a correct and safe handling.
