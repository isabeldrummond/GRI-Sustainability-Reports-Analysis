3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT

Actions to face risks and exploit opportunities, in reference to sustainability as well, are the inputs necessary to define the
operational planning in line with the company strategy.

The Group has also stipulated policies with important companies in the field, with the aim of covering the main business
risks in industrial activities. The insurance coverage involves all material damages to buildings, plants, machinery and
goods owned by the Group companies, whether they are present in PSC plants or by third parties.

Limits and specific exemptions change according to other factors, such as: weather events, intentional acts of third parties,
structural collapse, liquid leakage and mechanical breakdowns. Any economic losses that may result from business
interruptions or caused by factors, such as those listed above, are also covered by insurance. Finally, possible damages

to third parties were also insured, if resulting from claims and covered by policy (third-party claim and interruption or
suspension of third party activities).

A policy consisting of three sections, concerning claims for damages, was signed by the Group companies. More
specifically: third-party liability, civil liability of factory workers and products. Each coverage uses limited maximum
coverage and allowances.
