PSC presents its second Economic, Environmental and
Social sustainability report this year, which shows the
commitment of this Group to a sustainable and socially
responsible development.

  

We have closed down the current year with quite a positive
result, despite downturns affecting the automotive
industry in the last quarter of 2018.

Over this year, sales have reached all-time record and we
have indeed strengthened our position on the market.

However, in spite of the progress made in the international
market as well as in the agricultural field, we must be
vigilant in view of the evolving events which, following
massive structural changes, will impose us to enhance
resilience in the short run.
