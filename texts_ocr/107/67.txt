Incident rate for permanent workers, as well as temporary workers, is decreasing in Prima Components business unit and Eldoprima,
whereas there is a slight increase among the workers of Sole Components and PSMM. The main types of incidents occurred are:
cutting, dislocation and strain injury. However, there was a decrease of incident rate for Sole Components temporary workers. In all
Group sites, events such as injuries, accidents and similar incidents are managed by providing an accurate assessment of possible
causes, So to set up initiatives to be applied with the purpose of avoiding repetition. Hitting, crushing and cutting: these are the risky
events identified by Prima Components and PSMM factory in Campania, following accurate assessment. In order to eliminate hazards
and minimize risks, Prima Components has put in place specific working procedures, which also include appropriate use of PPE, as
well as the necessary training and awareness of the issue.

Following the risk assessment, Sole Components has identified fork-lift operation, material handlings and falls as the most
hazardous events. In order to minimize this risks, forklift drivers were provided with information and awareness, alongside
improvement in signs and markings.

After analyzing risks in Sole Pontedera factory, it was found hazardous fall in the molding department during changing. In order

to avoid this risk, a walking platform was installed in the molding department and adequate training to operators involved in shift
change was given.

In PSMM factory of Pernambuco, new machinery setting is to be considered risky activity, due to an assessment for significant risks
of falling, which were reduced thanks to specific platforms development and accurate workers’ training.

For the plants of Proprad and GSI DE, the use of extruders is to be considered at risk, as regards hands cutting which has been

assessed as dangerous activity. Access to areas where there are moving parts has been limited and with the purpose of risk
reduction also specific training was performed.
