propensity towards recycling, in order to avoid more effectively the contamination of soil and water, to
constantly monitor the quantities of materials used (chemicals, polymers) to control emissions into the
atmosphere.

© To privilege those suppliers who demonstrate that they have carried out initiatives in favour of the
environment.

The commitment to intervene on significant environmental aspects, direct and indirect, with the best
technologies economically sustainable.

External analysis laboratories for the assessment of the main environmental impacts (emissions,
discharges, noise, waste), dedicated internal resources and external consulting firms for the energy
assessment of individual sites.

© Involvement of all the professional skills necessary for development, management and control activities
Adoption and maintenance of an environmental management system.

For most plants, the management system is also certified according to IS014001.
