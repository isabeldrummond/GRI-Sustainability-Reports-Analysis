5.2 ENERGY CONSUMPTION

PSC aims to imPSC aims to improve its environmental performance and energy consumption on a regular basis, in order to
reduce it in production sites and offices, by implementing specific policies and projects.

Specifically, among the initiatives launched, the followings are included:
+ Introduction of more efficient production machinery and equipment, in terms of energy consumption (e.g. inverter)
+ Installation of more energy-efficient lighting systems (e.g. LED)
+ Adoption of management systems which are environmental and in line with the 15014001 standard

In those factories using Word Class Manufacturing (W/CM) method, such as Prima Components of Anagni, Prima Components of
Ferentino and PSMM of Pernambuco, Energy pillar aims to increase the ability of initiatives identification and implementation, in
order to reduce waste and to improve energy efficiency.

In the factory of Sole Oderzo a heat exchange system was designed and installed on painting fumes sewage treatment from
the Euroline painting plant, with acceptance issued in September 2014. This innovative solution has allowed access to GSE
service, by obtaining relevant certification, with a period of validity of 5 years and currently in progress.

Such certification is the project validity which is officially recognized by institutions as an “innovative project with a high
environmental content”, by attesting the presence of an effective and low cost recovering / reusing system. This will be able

to turn huge quantities of energies that, otherwise, would have been produced through fossil fuels and their derivatives
conversion, as well as to generate significant savings in economic terms (pay-back time in less than 15 months) and a lower
environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gases.

In the following table, changes in BU energetic consumption are reported values as variations compared to the machine hours

Energetic consumption is increasing for Prima Components and PSMM business units, is stable for Sole Components and is
decreasing for Eldoprima.
