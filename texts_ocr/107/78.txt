5.1 THE ENVIRONMENT

Respect for the environment is the main priority of PSC. For this reason, we care for it with the same passion we have for our
products and we pay attention to customer's requests as well.

PSC is constantly committed to technological systems application and operations which, not only meet legal obligation and
pollution reduction, but also aim at environmental efficiency improvement.

PCS factories, having ISO 14001 certification, measure their environmental impact of activities and processes by developing
provisions for reduction. Furthermore, during the development of new products using FMEA method, an assessment for

potential environmental risks is carried out.

Despite the importance of environmental issues for PSC, the available data did not make possible a scientific risk assessment,
one of the elements necessary for the application of the precautionary principle. Nevertheless, even if it has not been possible
to apply this principle so far, PSC protects its resources and works in compliance with all existing regulations.

It is important to underline that some business tools, such as risk analysis for accidents prevention assessment in the
workplace, as well as occupational diseases, are evolving. In fact, they are not restricted to assess existing risks, but also aim at
forecasting hazards. These procedures are represented in the following diagram.
