3.7 LOCAL COMMUNITIES RELATIONSHIPS

For PSC it is crucial to build up relationships with the local communities where the plants are located, an aspect that is meant
to be enhanced over the years ahead.

In this perspective, the Brazilian plant in Pernambuco has established a formal procedure to monitor requests made by the
local community. This is a way to make PSC site more open to the hosting area.

As for the social field, since 2015 PSC has collaborated with the “Comunita in Dialogo” (Dialogue Community) of Trivigliano, in
the province of Frosinone, which is active in the recovery of people who had problems with addiction to drugs and alcohol. In
particular, Prima Components of Anagni is involved in a project that allowed six new human resources from the community
to enter the staff. In the years ahead, there is the intention of gradually entering other resources in the factory, so to complete
their recovery path in the community, following simultaneously an assessment of psycho-aptitude requirements.

PSC commitment to the communities, which hosts new production sites, takes shape also in other fields. In particular, all plants
of Sole business units aim to sponsor clubs in order to support activities in the field of education, culture and sport. An example
is Sole Azzurra, which is involved in sponsoring the local football team.
