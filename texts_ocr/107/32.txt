2.3 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

In order to define PSC material themes, the definition of stakeholders’ expectations and points of view represent a

fundamental step. This operation took shape thanks to the stakeholder engagement, which was divided into different

phases:

- Identification of types of stakeholders: this process has joined the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard
(AA1000SES) 2015 and has led to the identification of the categories listed in the table below, each accompanied by
its related description.

Worker Employees working for or on behalf of PSC, including its representatives (e.g. trade unions)
Supplier Provider of products or services to PSC
Customer Customers of PSC products
Investor Who holds shares within PSC
Society and local The social context in which PSC sites are located. It can influence its activities
communities
Institutions The set of institutions that can influence the PSC activities (e.g. Region, Province or
Municipality in which PSC sites are located)
NGO and Non-profit associations and private organizations operating in areas that influence PSC
Associations activities (e.g. environmental associations or sector associations)
Media and press International, national and local media (e.g. television, press, radio and web) which PSC can

use to communicate its initiatives

Definition of engagement methods and implementation: in 2018 PSC suppliers were directly involved by giving them

a questionnaire regarding their approach to sustainability. For other categories of stakeholders, indirect ways of
engagement were used; the documentation needed was therefore selected and analyzed, in order to build up different
opinions and requests on material themes.
