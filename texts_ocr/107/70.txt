AND DEVELOPMENT

During 2018, PSC was equipped with IT system which,
following personnel administration, allows to manage human
resources by using a specific pattern. This starts through the
identification of the required skills in a role, which will be later
on assessed and eventually end up through the definition of a
plan for resource development.

In 2017 the activity was started on the SP Prima pilot site.

In 2018, staff assessment systems were extended to all the
other PSC facilities.

In Italy there is a staff compensation system that provides, in
addition to fixed remuneration, the use of collective variable
remuneration instruments (performance bonus).

Although PSC does not have a structured Management

By Objectives (MBO) system, a rewarding system has been
developed this year for those team members who design and
carry out implementation projects, aiming at specific issues.
