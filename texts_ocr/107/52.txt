3.6 RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN

Moreover, in line with sustainability principles, the purchasing department supports suppliers showing a consistent approach
towards ethical standards. For this reason, PSC asks suppliers to adopt their own ethics code that regulates subjects, such as
respect for human rights and anti-corruption measures, as well as ISO 9001 quality management certification.

In the suppliers’ selection, it is considered an asset having health and safety management systems (OHSAS 18001 / ISO 45001),
as well as environmental management (ISO 14001).

Suppliers are then required to demonstrate the implementation of those measures able to improve the quality of products
and/or processes, setting up of training courses for internal staff, along with the development of accurate methods in
managing their own suppliers.

All suppliers of raw materials and components are required to enter definitive information on the basic composition of products
and components directly on the International Material Data System (IMDS). In this way it is possible to comply with the European
regulation on end-of-life vehicles (DIR 2000/53 / EC) and its amendments.

If the customer has contractually defined a list of designated suppliers, the so-called “imposed suppliers”, the material or

the product to be used for the production is purchased from these companies. In any case, even this category of suppliers is
subject to monitoring, unless otherwise specified in the agreement with the customer. A business intelligence tool, introduced
in 2017, is at operating speed, and it aims at promoting the utmost transparency and traceability of the purchasing process.

During the reporting year, there were organizational changes in the supply chain for the recruitment of new suppliers for the
new customers/markets of “Twice PS” business unit, which became part of the Group.
