TURNOVER Components

2018

 

Overall turnover rate is increasing in Prima Components and Sole Components: both business units increased for hiring
and contract termination in the reporting year. On the other hand, PSMM and Eldoprima business units turnover decreased,
following hiring and contract termination reduction. This shows more stability after rearrangements during last year.
