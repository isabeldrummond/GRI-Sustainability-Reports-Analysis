5.4 SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION

The application of a management system promotes respect for the environment in every way and, at the same time, it is
a fundamental factor for the organization growth. All PSC production sites use specific quality, environmental and safety
management systems, which are mostly certified.
Nine out of fifteen production sites have the UNI EN ISO 14001 environmental management system certification.
