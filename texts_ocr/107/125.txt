Torino, July 15, 2019

To the Board of Directors of
PS.C. - Prima Sole Components S.p.A.
and to all interested parties

SAI Global Italia S.r1. (SAI Global) was mandated by PS.C. - Prima Sole Components S.p.A. to carry out an
independent assessment of the Sustainability Report for the year 2018, in order to verify the correct
application of GRI Standards 2016-2018 (option ‘in accordance’ - Core), including the relevance and reliability
of its contents with respect to stakeholders' expectations.

SAI Global has not played any direct or indirect role in the preparation of the document, whose contents are

the sole responsibility of P.S.C.

SAI Global declares its independence and absence of conflicts of interest with regard to P.S.C. and its

stakeholders.

The assessment was carried out considering in particular the ISAE 3000 (Revised) international standard, in

"limited assurance" mode.

Our task involved:
- acompleteness and consistency analysis of the Sustainability Report under assessment with respect to the

standards adopted by PS.
- the investigation of qualitative and quantitative aspects deemed to be significant for stakeholders,

 

including achievement of objectives stated in the previous Report, referred to by our assurance statement
dated November 19", 2018;
- the interview on a sample basis of P.S.C. staff and interested parties' representatives.

CONCLUSION

Based on the above activities and selected sample, no contrary evidence arose to let us conclude that:

- the Sustainability Report of P.S.C. S.p.A. for the year 2018 has been prepared in substantial compliance
with GRI Standards 2016-2018 (option ‘In accordance’ - Core);

- the data and information included in the Report are consistent with the assessed documents.

We therefore believe that the Sustainability Report of Prima Sole Components - PS.C. S.p.A. for the year 2018
contains an adequate representation of strategies, policies and sustainability performances of the company,
with respect to the principles of materiality, responsiveness and completeness, and to stakeholders’

expectations.

Best regards,
