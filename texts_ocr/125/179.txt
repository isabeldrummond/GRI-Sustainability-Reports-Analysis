6.8.2 TDT dangerous goods area

TDT dangerous goods area has a storage capacity of 864 TEUs, which can be extended
by an additional 576 TEUs in case of need. In order to comply with the provisions of
the local, national and international regulations for the management of dangerous
goods, TDT identified specific predefined bays, dedicated to the stacking of dangerous
goods containers, pursuant to the IMDG Code. In such areas, the DG cargo containers
are stored respecting safety distances (damage distance and segregation) and any
additional prescriptions, from time to time indicated by the local chemical port service.
Specific areas are also dedicated to the stacking of rolling stock, considered IMO
pursuant to the IMDG Code (e.g. UN 3166 and UN 3171), and to cargo openings and
inspections required by local authorities.

To contain any spills, the terminal has equipped itself with mobile systems, more exactly
three 45’ Mafi, equipped for the containment of spills of solid or liquid materials from
containers. For emergency management, a 50 kg wheeled fire extinguishers, A-B-C
approved, are provided to cover the area, located in outdoor areas, close to the base
of the lighting towers; there is always an emergency management team that has
equipment available for intervention and for the area circumscription.

As can be seen from the table, the main traffic concerns containers belonging to the
classes: 3 flammable liquids (a sharp drop in exports ,but an increase in imports),
5.1 oxidising substances (increasing in exports and slightly decreasing in 2019 in
transhipments), 8 corrosive substances (reduced in import/export) and 9 dangerous
materials and objects. The import for the 4.3 class is down.
