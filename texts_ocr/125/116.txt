TDT is located in an industrial port area, on a poorly urbanised area to
the south and west, while to the east it is close to other industrial plants
with risk of a major accident; to the north it is adjacent to the Calambrone
touristic area.

The visual impact is related to the equipment placed on the quay and
at yard, visible from the nearest beaches of the Calambrone, while the
containers stored do not present characteristics of significance.

The terminal is equipped with 8 quay cranes (1 of which alienated in
2019) and 13 RTGs, of which 11 operate on 5+1 tiers and 2 operate on
2+1 tiers. In order to maintain a satisfactory level of competitiveness in
a traffic scenario that foresees the implementation of vessels of ever
greater capacity, in 2015 TDT undertook an investment programme with
the replacement of 2 quay cranes with 2 post-panamax cranes, i.e.
cranes with outreach up to 18 rows of containers on board and height
below spreader up to 38 meters above sea level. The delivery of this
machine occurred in 2017. TDT always stacked containers up to the 5th
tier in height, both for empty and full.

There are no ionising radiations in any of the two terminals, except for
those emitted inside the structure in which the scanner of the Customs
Agencies is, during the activity of containers scanning, which is however
carried out in the absence of personnel on the inside of the facility.
