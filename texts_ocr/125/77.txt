oe) At the moment, internal metres are not installed at SECH, which allow for

the reporting of electricity consumption divided by type of equipment:

Ric based on the nominal power, it is however possible to estimate the

energy absorption of the different equipment. In TDT, on the other hand,

re there are partialised metres that have been made legible and remotely
monitored since 2018 (SCADA project).

Below is the breakdown of energy consumption.

e office activities;

 

At SECH, 57% of energy needs are covered by diesel, 40% by electricity and 3% by
methane (used only to heat sanitary waters). Compared to 2018, there was a slight
increase in the supply of methane. The total committed electrical power grew by 8%
compared to 2018, due to the addition/modernisation of the lighting towers and
columns for the temperature-controlled containers’ power supply. Shore cranes (41%)
and RMGs (31%) are always the topmost users. Considerable, and growing compared
to 2018, the electricity from reefer containers plugging (from 17% to 23%).

Transtainer 31,29%
SSGCs 41,02%
- Lighting towers 0,27%

Lights and power supply 4,77%

Reefer 31,29%
