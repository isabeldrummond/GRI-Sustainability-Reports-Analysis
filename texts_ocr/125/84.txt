5.1.1.2 CONSUMPTION OF RAW MATERIALS AND PACKAGING

The improvement actions on purchases led to an increase for TDT of the
percentage of recycled paper on the total as desired. The reported
paper consumption relates to A3/A4 and tissue printing paper.

For both terminals, the actions focused on the reduction of packaging at the moment:
inside the offices the bottles of water were replaced by 20-liter bottles returned to the
supplier for subsequent reuse, plus each employee received a “designer” bottle. For
personnel working at yard and in the workshop, plastic water bottles at SECH have been
replaced by biodegradable ecological plastic bottles. The action will make it possible to
decrease the production of plastic waste by around 120.000 bottles per year.

5.1.1.3 WATER CONSUMPTION

As far as the water supply at SECH terminal is concerned, there is a
contract, for industrial use, with the company running the ordinary and
extraordinary maintenance of the supply network. The metres located in
the SECH concession area are four, two for civil users and two for the
firefighting network, one of which is dedicated to dangerous goods. The
water withdrawn for civil use is utilised for toilets, showers and vehicle
washing.

Water consumption is monitored at SECH since 2018 through a direct
reading of the four metres, performed quarterly by the HSSE workers
and compared with what invoiced from the supplier. Any anomaly or
discrepancy is promptly reported to verify the cause.

 

The greatest water withdrawal refers to the two buildings, where the
changing rooms also reside. Consumption during 2019 increased
significantly following a hidden leak in the section of pipe that feeds the
washbasins of a changing room. The underground line was intercepted
upstream and bypassed externally in November 2019.
