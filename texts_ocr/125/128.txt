5.5 COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL
LEGISLATION

ese For both terminals, the procedures for checking compliance with the
legal requirements are described in a dedicated procedure and the
y regulatory update is guaranteed by subscribing to a series of newsletters,
—+4 so as to be promptly informed about outgoing or exiting and pending
regulations to enter into force. An external compliance audit conducted
by an external party as a first-party audit, verifies annually that compliance is
guaranteed. For TDT, which is ISO 14001 certified, the management system provides for
the keeping of a list of applicable laws, indicating the reference aspect, the specific
subject, the date of entry into force, the source, the type of legislation, all deadlines
(past, current and subsequent), as well as the evidence and the responsible company
function.The subsequent third party audit by the certification body verifies compliance
a second time. Failure to comply with a regulatory requirement, be it a payment,
compliance with limits, an obligation to report and/or send to the competent body,
prevents certification from being obtained. Also the internal audits envisaged by the
Management Model (MoG) pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01 ascertain in both
terminals the absence of non-conformities representing an environmental criminal
offense.

SS

 

In 10 years no first level non-conformity, which is linked to a lack of serious legislative
compliance, has ever been detected.

The discrepancies found are managed as non-conformities, with corrective actions
whose outcome is evident.
