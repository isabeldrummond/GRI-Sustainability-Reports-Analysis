5.1.3 Waste production

All activities related to waste management and regulatory compliance (mandatory
and voluntary) are regulated within specific procedures within both SECH and TDT
management systems.

Outside of the waste listed in the below paragraphs, neither SECH nor TDT treat or
transport, import, export hazardous waste. The internal staff was informed of the correct
management, for the purpose of transferring them to the internal and road bins, both
through periodic information and through training courses on the management
system.

5.1.3.1 SECH WASTE PRODUCTION

Pt The waste produced by SECH is generated mainly by the maintenance
sted

activity of the rolling stock and cranes, which is carried out by direct
whe personnel (e.g. oils, batteries, spare parts, consumables), but also by

office activities. Waste-handling personnel were addressees of specific
courses.

Lo} operations (R13 for putting waste into a reserve before subjecting them
to one of the other recovery operations, RY for regeneration or other reuse

of oils), and disposal of the same (D1 “deposit on or in the ground”, for

12 EP example landfill, and D15 “preliminary deposit before one of the disposal

QO operations”), depending on the type of waste.

 

 

As shown in the table below, in 2019 the total waste produced grew by
around 30% compared to the previous year, while there was an increase
of 21% on the overall total of waste sent for recovery, to the detriment of those sent to
disposal operations. Rapidly analysing the individual items, the growth is attributable
to the significant production of end-of-life tyres, due to the disposal of the tyres of
two RTGs, sold since they were not used. The same applies to CER 160120 (glass for
end-of-life vehicles) and to CER 170405 and 170407 (metals), always coming from
RTGs demolition. The other unusual data is related to the production of paper and
cardboard, due to the disposal of a company archive carried out in the summer. On
the other hand, the production of waste containing oil and the associated absorbent
material is in line, with the previous years, as spills at yard in 2019 were equal in number
compared to 2018 (see paragraph 5.4.1).

Such quantities are added together with the percentages of urban waste that are
collected inside the terminal in special bins and gathered by the assigned municipal
company.

Specifically we refer to:
e Unsorted waste sent for disposal;
e paper and plastic packaging, sent for recovery.

The terminal is not required to keep accounts of these types of waste, therefore no
quantitative data is available, in any case we can quantify a reduction of about 120,000
plastic bottles per year thanks to their elimination from supplies and positioning of fixed
drinking water dispensers inside the offices.
