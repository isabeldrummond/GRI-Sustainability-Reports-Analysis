As shown in the table, the behavioural datum is the most important one.

This macro category includes: accidental fall, accidental event, incorrect handling or
misuse of equipment, accident between vehicles, violation of speed limits that cause an
accident, driving vehicles, procedures not followed, handling of the wrong load, failure
to use personal protective equipment, collision with obstacles, incorrect operation and
intentional event. In most of the events listed above, the reason behind the accident
is not actually considered as a separate cause, capable, by itself, of generating the
event, since this would lead to neglect the conditions in which the performance that
results in a damaging event occurs; in the analysis, on the other hand, the conditions
at the origin of distraction are considered, such as, for example, process factors and
interfaces that may favour forgetfulness or confusion (work-related or not). Or, again,
interference with other tasks or other objects of attention. The identification of these
elements is fundamental to be able to significantly tackle work and therefore bring a
concrete and effective improvement.

In order to avoid the recurrence of this type of accident, the following actions have
been taken in order to reduce or eliminate their relapse, specifically:

e Conclusion of the safety campaign aimed at improving workers’ awareness,
involving also permanent external suppliers;

e extension of training on the correct behaviour to be followed once in terminal, in
order to prevent injuries to all TDT operating employees;

© conducting safety coordination meetings with permanent suppliers.

In 2019, 8 accidents also occurred, occurring to staff not employed, but operating in
the terminal. All accident events relating to external TDT workers are not attributable
to critical issues detected in the workplace, but derive from the performance of the
specific activity of the permanent supplier. The number of accidents concerns six
different companies that deal with crane maintenance, vehicle maintenance, tyre
maintenance, monitoring of temperature-controlled containers, work on board and
the internal container transport service. With particular regard to 2019, there are 2
accidents for the crane maintenance company and 6 for the company that carries
out work on board.
