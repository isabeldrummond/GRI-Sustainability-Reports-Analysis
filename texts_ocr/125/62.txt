The workers of the two companies are classified in national collective
labour agreements: for employees with the qualification of “middle
managers”, “clerks” and “blue-collar workers” (about 98%), reference is
made to the National Bargaining Agreement (hereinafter CCNL) of port
workers, for the “executives” (the remaining 2%) to the CCNL for executives
of industrial companies.

90% of the remuneration is based on the first-level national contract
and the supplementary company contract, while the remaining 10% is
established on the basis of the responsibility and the role covered by the
management, which reports directly to the General Manager.

In particular, supplementary (or second-level) bargaining plays an
important role in determining the overall remuneration. By integrating
the national collective bargaining agreement, it has the dual objective
of creating organisational efficiency for the company, on the one hand,
and of bringing additional remuneration to workers, on the other.

Starting from the aforementioned assumptions, the current supplementary
company contract in TDT focuses mainly on institutions supporting
productivity, promoting greater flexibility of human resources, compatibly
with a greater sustainability of work-life balance.

 

SECH, for its part, has agreed on an additional contract based basically
on two factors: the increase in productivity and the decrease in effective
absenteeism.
