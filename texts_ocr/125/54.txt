The equity structures of SECH and TDT and their economic health are
essential for their sustainability. Companies are born to create profit and
there can be no sustainable development without creating value and
economic solidity.

In this regard, it is useful to highlight that, on December 4th, 2017,
SECH and TDT joined the national tax consolidation pursuant to
articles 117/129 of the Consolidated Income Tax Act (TUIR) with the
parent company Gruppo Investimenti Portuali S.p.A., which acts as a
consolidating company and determines a single tax base for the group
of companies participating in the national tax consolidation and which
thus benefits from the possibility to offset taxable income with tax losses
in a single declaration. Each company participating in the national tax
consolidation transfers the tax income (taxable income or tax loss) to the
consolidating company. Gruppo Investimenti Portuali S.p.A. recognizes

a credit towards companies that provide taxable income, equal to the IRES (i.e.
corporation tax) to be paid. On the other hand, towards companies that make tax
losses, Gruppo Investimenti Portuali S.p.A. records a debt equal to IRES on the part of
the loss actually offset at group level.

The group of companies participating in the tax consolidation consists of:
e SE.BE.R. Srl with registered office in Genoa (GE), Calata Sanita Palazzina Uffici, 16126;

e Terminal Contenitori Porto di Genova S.p.A. (SECH) with registered office in Genoa
(GE), Calata Sanita Palazzina Uffici, 16126;

e Terminal Darsena Toscana S.r.l.s.u. (TDT) with registered office in Leghorn (LI), Via
Mogadiscio 23, Darsena Toscana, 57123.
