7.1 OUR METHODOLOGY

For the preparation of the sustainability report, the companies have chosen to adopt
the 2016 standard GRI guidelines with the related amendments of 2018 - widely used
all over the world - and the official Italian translation published in the summer of 2019,
defined by Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The intent of SECH and TDT is to ensure
maximum transparency while also allowing comparability over time and space (i.e.
benchmarking) of the information contained in the report.

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an international, independent, non-profit organisation
and leader in the sustainability sector, which established standard guidelines with the
aim of helping governments and organisations understand and communicate the
impacts of their activities on sustainable issues.

For this reason, every organisation using the “Consolidated set of GRI Sustainability
Reporting Standards" guidelines is required to notify the GRI of the use of the standard
by sending a copy of the report to standards@globalreporting.org or registering it on
the site www.globalreporting.org/standards.

GRI has strategic partnerships with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP),
the United Nations Global Compact, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and
other international cooperation bodies.

SECH and TDT also for 2019 ventured together in a broader scale reporting and
conducted the project using an internal work team, transversal to the two companies.
A special mention goes to the individual team members for their commitment to the
creation of the document. This is therefore to thank Mr. Thomas Bertacchini, Ms. Paola
Cavassa, Mr. Mariano Finocchiaro, Ms. Tiziana Gianuzzi, Mr. Massimiliano Gustini and
Ms. Silvia Previdi for SECH; Ms. Valentina Del Greco, Ms. Adriana Maconi, Mr. Nicola
