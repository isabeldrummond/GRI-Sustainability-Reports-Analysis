2.2.2 TDT

TDT started its activity on January 1*,1997 and since 2012 it became part of GIP Gruppo
nvestimenti Portuali S.p.A.

The strategic position from a logistical point of view, with easy access by road and rail
and the annual operational capacity of 900.000 TEUs make TDT the main container
ferminal in the port of Leghorn.

n addition to being the port of call for the central and north-east Italian markets, or the
ideal outlet of a large hinterland formed mainly by Tuscany, Emilia Romagna and upper
Lazio, TDT is the key point for access to European markets, also playing an important
role for the American (US in particular) and West African markets.

n recent years, TDT has also taken on a significant role as a transhipment port for
cargoes from the Americas to East Med and vice versa.

Located in the heart of the industrial port, close to the logistic centre and the Pisa
nternational Airport, TDT is directly connected to the main motorways and major road
networks in the area.

n December 2016, the inauguration of the direct rail link between the terminal and the
national line, the first case in Italy, made it possible to abolish the transfer of goods in
he sorting station, thus ensuring reduced transit times and greater timetables reliability.

Leghorn is the largest Italian port for refrigerated cargo and one of the main ones for
project cargo coming from the areas of north-east and central Italy. The terminal has
herefore been equipped with facilities and areas dedicated to reefer containers, with
889 reefer plugs (80 of which are located in the inspection area) and various cargo
operations, managed by specialised personnel.
