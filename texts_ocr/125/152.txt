ODHEALH Health surveillance is one of the preventive measures for workers exposed

to health risks which may be caused by physical, chemical, biological or
mL ergonomic agents.

Health checkups are carried out according to a schedule defined
Re by the competent physician in agreement with the employers of the
weal §— terminals, who is in possession of the requisites foreseen by the law,
7 | carrying out medical examinations in suitable environments equipped
ry” for the checkup of the various aspects of physical and psycho-attitudinal
functionality of workers.

 

The outcomes of the medical examination are attached to the health and risk record
and according to them the competent doctor expresses a judgment relating to the
specific task, which may be: suitability; partial, temporary or permanent unsuitability,
with prescriptions or limitations; temporary unsuitability; permanent unsuitability.

The activity of the competent physician does not end with the health surveillance of the
workers, in fact he/she collaborates with the employer and with the HSSE department
for the risk assessment and the implementation of the measures for the protection
of health and psycho-integrity of workers; they also collaborate in the organisation
of the first-aid service, with particular regard to the definition of medical-surgical aids
available to the first-aid workers in charge.

The competent doctor also participates in the information and training of workers
and is the only one authorised to provide information to workers about the results of
diagnostic tests and health surveillance and the delivery of medical documentation,
upon request or upon termination of the employment relationship. It is important to
underline that the risk health record contains sensitive data and must therefore be
treated in compliance with professional secrecy and the provisions of Legislative
Decree 196/2003 regarding the protection of personal data.

In addition to the health surveillance activities described above, both terminals signed
private insurance, to guarantee all workers access to health services, even outside of
work, with the aim of preserving health thanks to programmes of annual checkups and
further visits and examinations for diagnostic tests.
