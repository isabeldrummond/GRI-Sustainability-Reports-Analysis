Consumption monitoring

In order to keep energy consumption under control and to be able to consciously
evaluate any corrective and energy efficiency activities, SECH checks the diesel
consumption of all owned vehicles through daily surveys: the activity allows to
have indicators that can serve as a bell alarm in case of undetected malfunctions.
