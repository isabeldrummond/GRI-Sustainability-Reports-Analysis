These activities consist of Authority-Business and Business-Business relations:

A2B

AIDA (Integrated Customs Excise Automation). It is the information system of the
Customs Agency, operational since November 10', 2003. This system makes the
digitalisation of the relationship with users and administrations tangible. The portal for
interoperability among administrations and among these ones and users (Aida Services
for Interoperability) makes the “integrated” processes working with the administrations
involved in a one-stop shop logic and offers new interactive services to users.

PMIS (Port Management Information System). The PMIS system is employed by the
Harbour Master's staff both in the performance of administrative procedures related
to the arrival and departure of vessels and for the supervision of traffic within the port
waters.

B2B

E-Port (since 2004) in Genoa and TPCS (since 2008) in Leghorn are sharing platforms
or Port Community Systems (PCS), which consent the various operators of the port to
interact in a safe environment.SECH and TDT are, starting from the design and the birth
of the two systems, at the centre of the dialogues for the development of the structure
which guarantees the security of information flows among different subjects that are
part of it, allowing the elimination of paper documents, with the achievement of a
significant goal, consisting in the normalisation and rationalisation of processes.
