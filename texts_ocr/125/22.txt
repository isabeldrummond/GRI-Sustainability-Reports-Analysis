The traffic trend in 2019 demonstrates a high sensitivity of the sector to
protectionist activities, duties and trade wars.

MART Shipowners found themselves faced with a series of challenges, one
of which represented by the entry into force of the new international

 

9 mm legislation wanted by the IMO (International Maritime Organisation),
. which imposes a limit of 0.5% on the sulfur emissions generated by
AGS maritime transport. The low availability and high prices of low sulfur fuel

has prompted companies to focus on the best alternative choice, namely
ODNEAT the exhaust fumes purifiers, the so-called scrubbers, both expensive and
rr not very in line with the trend towards sustainability of the last times. It
mL has been and will still be very difficult for shipping companies to be

ba able to move all the extra costs associated with the sulfur cap to their
customers. This is because, in the extremely competitive environment in
pet = which the carriers operate, the composition of the maritime freight (and
wa land freight, with door-door prices) becomes a lump sum, in which the

| additional ones disappear or are subject to commercial negotiation.

This has led once again to favour first the processes of horizontal

aT orn concentration between lines of similar dimensions, subsequently - once
S the benefits of scale for this type of operations have been exhausted
14 - the carriers have aimed to generate new cash flows, making vertical

integrations in land and port logistics, which is believed to have higher

In 2019, then, the ongoing vessel upsizing is yet another aspect that one
9) can't help focussing on. It is a fact that from a double error of shipowners
evaluation an unnecessary race to build ever larger ships was born. The
first fault was an economic one. Simplifying, it was believed that China
would maintain high growth rates for a long time on exports. On the contrary, the
slowdown was significant, with the country’s repositioning on internal consumption.
The second mistake was commercial. Those who started building the first 18-20,000-TEU
ships believed that competition would not follow suit, but it did.

 

The result was unsustainable for the individual companies, nonetheless the investments
were maintained through the creation of operational alliances, which ended up
exerting enormous infrastructural pressure not only on ports, but also on the public
entities in charge of the tasks of port and control activities."

In 2019 the three largest alliances (2M, Ocean Alliance and THE Alliance) continue to
control 91% of the capacity on the Far East - North Atlantic trade and 99% on the Far
East - Europe trade.
