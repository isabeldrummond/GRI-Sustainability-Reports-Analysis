During 2019, it should be noted that 60% of accidents related to internal staff find
causes equally distributed between stair descent, airborne materials and crushes. The
remaining 40% is divided between descent from vehicles, falls on ground level, recoils

and collisions.

Over a ten-year period, the main causes that underlie the occurrence of events are
descent from vehicles, collisions, falls on ground level and crushes.

With regard to 2019, considering the type of accidents occurred, the intervention
activities in order to reduce or eliminate their recurrence, specifically, were:

© Individual information and training interventions aimed at sensitising operators
regarding the correct behaviours to follow during the execution of specific work
activities;

© improvement of the mapping of the manhole covers to be monitored, within the
checklists of the HSSE service;

e installation of signs on the platforms of the quay cranes, which prohibit the stationing
of personnel during the transit of the trolley.

As for the accidents that occurred to external personnel, in 2019 the causes of the
events were the dispersion of materials in the air following to a gust of wind, the
improper ascent/descent of stairs from the guardhouse of the main concierge of the
terminal and the fall on ground level during transit in a non-pedestrian area.

 

To avoid the recurrence of this type of accident, the intervention activities in order to
reduce or eliminate their recurrence, specifically, were:

e The application of a handrail on both sides of the access staircase to the main
gatehouse of the terminal, in order to facilitate the entry and exit phases of the
security staff,

e disagreements with the work of some workers, so that they may adopt a more
careful behaviour during the performance of their duties inside the terminal.
