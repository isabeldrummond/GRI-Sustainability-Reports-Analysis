Production/management of waste (from maintenance activities, external vehicles
in transit);

discharges to the ground (from containers and external/rental vehicles);

diffuse emissions into the atmosphere (dust and gas from vehicles in transit and
from reclamation tanks).

The suppliers residing inside the site and those who temporarily carry out activities
at the terminal are evaluated and checked in terms of legislative compliance and
acquiescence with the contractual clauses, however there are no consumption data
relating to the activities carried out by them.

The logistics activities upstream and downstream of the processes (from ship, truck, train
moves to employee home-work commute) are out of the organisations’ management
control: It is not possible to carry out reliable assessments and consumption measurements
on them.

INTDT there is a noticeable increase in trains, due to the strengthening and electrification
of the railway network, which has allowed a greater flow of containers by rail instead of
truck/road, with a positive impact in terms of reduction of consumption and indirect
emissions.
