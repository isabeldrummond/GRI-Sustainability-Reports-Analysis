5.1.7 Electromagnetic emissions

Pre In both terminals the emissions of electromagnetic radiation are linked to

roti) = AtSECHa survey was conducted in July 2017 aimed at assessing electric
(ee) field strengths and magnetic induction. The monitoring concerned the
following sources: transformers, motors, equipment and control panels.
cUMATE The high-frequency electromagnetic field was also monitored, in order
eo to highlight any contributions determined by the radio-communication
G system inside the terminal and any sources of external origin (radar and
radio and tele-communication systems). A broadband field analyser
equipped with three isotropic probes was used for this purpose, to make
ee measurements both in low frequency ELF31 (1Hz - 400 kHz) and in high

frequency RF 32 (100 kHz - 40 GHz).

The assessment results are as follows:

 

SECH OUTCOMES

Measurements performed at SECH were made after identifying the points where the
electric field and magnetic induction could have the highest values, i.e. close to the
equipment and electrical panels. The measurement points were then selected based
on the geometry of the spaces, the location of the sources and by a field level screening
for the two components of the electromagnetic field. In total, 13 areas were identified
(quay cranes, RMGs, data centre rooms, transformer cabin, workshop, quay, yard and
gate) for a total of 44 measurement points, for some of which we also proceeded to
measure RF field. The surveys in the workshop concerned, in particular, the sources
consisting of tools for daily use (grinding wheel, miter saw, welding machine, etc.) and
were carried out with the operator in activity and positioning the probe near the head
and the trunk. The results of the analysis carried out testified the compliance with the
current regulations. The values measured in low frequency (ELF) were always below the
most precautionary threshold values, indicated as “General Public 1998” and those
identified for the protection of workers and indicated as “2013/35/EU", for workshop
equipment. As far as the high frequency sources (RF) are concerned, the values are
often at the limit of the sensitivity of the instrument, or well below the regulatory limits.

31. ELF: Extremely Low Frequency.
32. RF: Radio Frequency.
