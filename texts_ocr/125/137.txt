The above data consider all the funding received directly from the company, but do
not instead take into account the funded training, whose ownership remains with
accredited training bodies, which allow training to be provided to employees without
any disbursements for teaching (obviously the loss of income of the students is always
charged to the company).

Within the economic investments made over the last three years on training, SECH has
managed to use loans from private inter-professional funds and from public funds, as
detailed below:

© 2017: € 434 were funded;

e 2018: € 56.366 were funded, of which:
» € 50.366 from private inter-professional funds (Fondimpresa and Fondirigenti);
» €6.000 — from public funds (ESF - European Social Fund).

© 2019: € 19.285 were funded, 100% from private inter-professional funds (Fondimpresa
and Fondirigenti).

The economic investments made over the last three years by TDT on training have
been covered for over 68% by the revenues received from private inter-professional
funds, such as Fondimpresa and Fondirigenti, to which the company has adhered for
several years.
