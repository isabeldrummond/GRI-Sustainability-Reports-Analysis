Pursuing environmental sustainability means for both terminals to
implement policies, define objectives and undertake actions that allow
to mitigate the environmental impacts deriving from the exercise of the
activities, in compliance with the applicable legal and voluntary
prescriptions, preventing the pollution of the environmental matrices
(water, soil, air) and reducing the consumption of resources (energy, raw
and secondary materials).

The implementation of these purposes passes through the definition and
implementation of specific management procedures, the provision of
training to personnel, the daily control of compliance with the provisions,
the definition and monitoring of improvement objectives, the use of tools
that allow the control of legislative compliance and the management,
also through the use of specific software, of non-compliance with the
respective corrective and improvement actions.

Furthermore, the qualification and awareness of suppliers and
contractors, who operate within the terminals, are bearers of indirect
impacts. They are therefore requested, also through environmental
requirements included in contracts, compliance with current legislation
and internal procedures, as well as the adoption of working standards.

Since 2011, the adoption of the organisational and management model
(MoG) pursuant to Legislative Decree 231 /2001, which includes in its field
of application the prevention of certain types of environmental crimes,
represents for SECH and TDT an additional guarantee and control system
for compliance with the current legislation.

In particular, since 2009, TDT guarantees the controlled management of
environmental aspects and the improvement of its performance through
the adoption of an environmental management system certified
according to the UNI EN ISO 14001:2015 standard and annually verified
by an external accredited certification body. The environmental analysis
of TDT also analyses the aspects along all the processes and activities
carried out in the terminal (whether they are carried out by TDT or by
suppliers operating within the company boundaries), both in normal
