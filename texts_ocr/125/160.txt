a(t working at TDT is ongoing.
INSTITUTIONS:

As regards employees, the following initiatives are highlighted for 2019:

 

With a view to obtaining an ever greater and effective participation of
workers in the analysis of incidental events involving them, since 2019 the
HSSE workers have further improved the participation procedure of the RLS, so as they
are pooled for each event analysis of the causes to agree on corrective actions.

In the second half of 2019 several specific meetings were convened between the HSSE
workers and the RLS for the collection of reports and feedback on issues impacting on
health and safety, for the sharing of ideas, projects and improvement proposals; the
HSSE department keeps track of these meetings, sometimes even informal ones, in the
management system, drawing up specific meeting minutes.

As regards the external users of the terminal, the main TDT activities aimed at improving
the communication, participation and involvement area follow:

e Vertical signals and safety information

A new and wider signal was installed, with both Italian and English versions,
containing the safety rules and the behaviours to be followed in the areas of the
terminal with greater attendance by external staff as well as in the area dedicated
to the storage of hazardous containers. Brochures holders containing safety
information sheets have also been positioned in some of the company’s busiest
areas.

e Suppliers’ awareness with respect to terminal security

TDT met the main suppliers in order to define and share actions and work strategies
aimed at maintaining and, where necessary, improving high levels of health
and safety at work. In this sense, the prevention and protection service has also
elaborated and delivered a questionnaire dubbed “Specific safety at TDT” to the
external resident supplier of the shuttle service managing the internal transport
of the containers, with the aim of further sensitising the supplier of a service so
important and impacting on the safety and health of workers, as well as on
procedural and behavioural aspects deemed particularly sensitive, and therefore
essential, to operate according to high safety standards.
