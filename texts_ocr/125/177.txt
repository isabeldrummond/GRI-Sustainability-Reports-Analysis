6.8.1 SECH dangerous goods area

SECH dangerous goods area has a storage capacity of 549 TEUs; the terminal is also
endowed with a fire extinguishing system in this area, whose equipment amounts to 10
hydrants and 10 different foam barrels:

Four hydrants with the related 200-litre foam barrels placed underground;
six hydrants with the relevant 200-litre foam barrels placed overground.

SECH also makes use of the compulsory supplementary fire-fighting service, carried
out by an external supplier for the surveillance of the dangerous goods area 24/7, in
compliance with the provisions of the Port Authority of Genoa, n. 4/2001.

To prevent that the spillage of products from a container or from a tank may produce
a leak of substances on the ground, SECH set up a collection tank in the dangerous
goods area, divided into four sections, with a total area of about 60 square metres and
the perimeter walls built in reinforced concrete.

The tank is capable of housing four 20-foot containers or two 40-foot containers
simultaneously plus their contents and is equipped with pipes and shut-off valves that
allow direct aspiration of any product existent in one of the sections.

Emergency personnel continue to be duly trained in the procedures provided by the
IMDG Code, as well as about the use of the installed equipment, further to the practical
tests carried out directly on the field.
