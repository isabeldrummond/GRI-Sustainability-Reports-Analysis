At TDT, the intensity indicator is greatly affected by the significant consumption of the
reefer containers (from 55% to 46% of the total electricity consumption, not linked to the
terminal's performance): in any case, the performance is improved both including and,
above alll, excluding reefer consumption. Also for SECH, the progressive increase in the
indicator is attributable to reefer containers, which, as already mentioned, grew by 80%
in the three-year period. At SECH it is not possible to perform a more accurate analysis,
as separate metres by type are not available.
