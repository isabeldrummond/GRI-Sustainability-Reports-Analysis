2.2.1 SECH

Terminal Contenitori Porto di Genova S.p.A., with the brand SECH, since 1993 manages
the Calata Sanita container terminal. With a maximum annual capacity of 550,000
TEUs, it ranks among the main import/export terminals across the country.

The terminal is in a favourable position both in terms of access by sea (vessels moor in
less than an hour after entering the port) and by land, being effectively connected to the
main road and rail transport networks. This strategic position, together with investments
in human, instrumental and IT resources, makes the terminal an avant-garde structure,
which represents a key access point with respect to the production areas located in
northern Italy and southern Europe, which are its main catchment area.

The investments of the company, together with those of the port of Genoa, have allowed
in recent years to raise the quality level, in order to allow a faster and safer transit of
the goods, consenting the terminal to consolidate its position in the North Tyrrhenian
port market. In this context, an important investment programme concentrated on the
quay area, with the extension of the boom of four of the five cranes has for some
years now enabled the containers stowed in the twentieth row sea side to be easily
operated on the ship, so that large vessels can be accommodated (14,000-TEU class).
In addition, dredging operations have been completed, which have restored the quay
depth at -15 metres; furthermore a new structure for the inspection of goods for human
and non-human consumption, the only one existing within the port east side basin, is
being completed. The new building has a room for office use, completed with spaces
intended for the reception of goods and for carrying out inspection activities. The works
for the actual construction have been completed and the necessary authorisations for
the commissioning of the structure are awaited.

operate as separate entities, each with its own management.
