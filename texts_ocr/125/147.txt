ence = For SECH and TDT it is crucial to establish, implement and maintain
ma §—COrOCesses aimed at the continuous identification and elimination of
hazards, so as to minimise the risks to the health and safety of operators
(in terms of probability of occurrence or potential severity of the damage
achieved).These processes take into consideration, in addition to routine

(wt business activities, also non-routine activities, accidents, emergency

Lat situations and organisational changes.

Once the hazard identification and risk assessment phases have been
completed, the terminals adopt effective preventive and protective
measures, to guarantee the protection of the health and safety of
workers and all those who access the companies’ premises.

 

Furthermore, SECH and TDT implement a system of controls aimed at ascertaining the
compliance of the health and safety management system with the mandatory and
voluntary standards of reference and at verifying the implementation and effectiveness
of the prevention and protection measures planned based on the risk assessment
activity, as well as the preparation of resources and adequate means to maintain and
continuously improve the management system. It should be noted that, in 2019, cases
of non-compliance with laws and/or regulations were not ascertained or reported for
both terminals.
