Terminal Darsena Toscana, on the other hand, carries out its activity as terminal operator
in the areas of the Darsena Toscana west bank of the port of Leghorn, assigned under
concession by the local Port Authority System of the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea.

The area falls within the northern industrial area, in the municipality of Leghorn, on the
border with the Pisa territory, and is delimited by the Arno stream channel to the north,
beyond which there is the Calambrone seaside touristic area with its WWF protected
dunes, to the east by the inhabited area of Stagno, to the south by the Ugione torrent
as well as the built coastline and to the west by the sea. The part of the maritime area
is delimited to the north by the mouth of the Arno stream channel and to the south by
the Leghorn Lighthouse, for a total length of approximately 4,250 km.

The industrial area is classified as a site of regional interest declared “critical area with
a high concentration of industrial activities”, defined by Ministerial Decree 25/05/2003
and as redefined by the Ministerial Decree dated 22/05/2014, which demarcated the
transfer of competences from the Ministry of the Environment and the Protection of the
Territory and the Sea (MATTM) to the Tuscany Region (art.2).

Further to this transfer of competences, the measures were set to deal with the
procedures for ascertaining and/or reclaiming the land as efficiently and effectively as
possible. The perimeter decree indicated as the main sources of pollution in the “site of
regional interest” area the activities of the refinery and the port area.

In the acoustic zoning plan of the municipality of Leghorn, TDT area is classified as a
“A-industrial” zone, that is, with higher emission and input limits. The last noise detection
campaign was carried out in 2018 by the Port Authority in all its state-owned areas and
by TDT in 2019 for the area of its competence: there is no detection of exceeding most
of the emission, input and differential.
