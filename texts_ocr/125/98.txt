5.1.4.2 LEAKAGES

Pt The leaking containers are immediately housed in containment tanks,
aN stoi a

which prevent the pouring of substances into the sensitive receptor
bodies. At TDT, since 2010 management costs are charged to the owner
of the goods, as often the causes are insufficient or incorrect packaging.
This allowed a recovery of management costs and greater attention
“ati during the preparation of the load, with a significant reduction in the
occurring of such events, as shown in the table below. The starting
incidence was 0.0148% against the current 0.0022%, going from about
20 cases per year to <10 today. Also at SECH the cost incurred for the
baat management of any leaking containers is borne by the shipping
SES = company, without charges for the terminal. Obviously this does not apply
in case of damaged containers during the handling phase, for which an
internal cost is generated.
