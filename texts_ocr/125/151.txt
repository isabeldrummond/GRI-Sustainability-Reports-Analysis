the involvement of workers and personnel existent in the terminals in the audit
activities, fo ascertain compliance with the requirements of the management
system;

knowledge of the risks existing in the context in which they operate;

the adoption of safety procedures and instructions in force;

identifying hazards, health and safety risks;

the ability to move away from work situations that they consider to represent a
serious and immediate threat to their life or health.

Consultation activities involve a kind of communication that promotes dialogue
and exchanges; the consultation actually involves making the essential information
available to the workers and the RLS, so as to provide informed feedback that must be
taken into consideration by the terminals before making a decision in terms of workers’
health and safety.

 
   
  
 
  

TOGETHER IN SAFETY

Safety in the workplace is not guaranteed only
by managers or by safety workers, but also by
all workers who with their behaviour can create
conditions of safety or insecurity for themselves
and their colleagues; hence the logo “Together
in safety”.
