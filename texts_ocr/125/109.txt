At SECH, the analysis was conducted during 2017: seven sensitive areas were identified,
where the measuring instruments were positioned and maintained.The survey revealed
concentration values below the limits taken as a reference for all the parameters
observed.

As for TDT, the analysis was carried out in 2008-2010 (11 sensitive areas) and repeated
in 2013 (3 sensitive areas), following to the dredging activities of some areas of the port,
the consequent creation of the second reclamation tank and the related transport
of sludge to the aforementioned tank. In 2019, the risk assessment review began, the
results of which will be published in 2020.

5.1.6.2 CONVEYED EMISSIONS

 

Pn The conveyed emissions inside the terminals are represented by:

e emissions from welding activities (from mechanical maintenance
activities at SECH - internal - and at TDT - contracted), regulated by

Deliberation 1260/2010 (SECH only);

emissions from mechanical metalworking and/or surface treatments
and/or other metalworking (from mechanical maintenance activities
Rr at SECH - internal - and at TDT - contracted), regulated by the provisions

of art. 272 Legislative Decree 152/2006 and Regional Deliberation
G 1260/2010 (SECH only).

Conveyed emissions are due to thermal plants. Emissions in abnormal or
emergency conditions of the air conditioning systems add also up to these ones.

 

The thermal power plants, both at SECH and at TDT, are used for the heating of sanitary
water in the changing rooms”, whereas the heating of the offices is guaranteed by
a system of heat pumps, used in air conditioning mode in the summer season. This
solution significantly reduces the consumption of traditional fuels (diesel or natural
gas), as well as emissions, however it must be kept under control due to the presence

25. Threshold limit value.

26. There is no TLV for PM,,. For this reason, the limit referred to urban areas as per Ministerial Decree,
dated 25/11/1994, was taken as reference.

27.At SECH the thermal power plant is also functional for the heating of the same and of the two offices
of the maintenance department.
