Terminal Contenitori Porto di Genova S.p.A., originally under the so-called Consorzio
Autonomo del Porto (Autonomous Consortium of the Port) and then privatised in 1993,
is based in Calata Sanita, in a strategic position within the Genoa Sampierdarena port
basin; the first centre of the west side of the city, outside the circle of the seventeenth-
century Mura Nuove, Sampierdarena includes the stretch of coast, now entirely
occupied by port infrastructures, between the promontory of Capo di Faro (where the
Lanterna - i.e. Genoa's middle ages Lighthouse - stands) to the east and the mouth of
the Polcevera stream to the west.

 

The location of the company within the basin allows for strategic proximity to access by
sea, rail and land and allows for unloading, loading and terrestrial connection with the
main logistics hubs.To ensure the flow of reloading carriers, there are five gate driveways,
two of which are automated for the exit of trucks, that can be used alternatively as
entrance or exit, and three 370-metre long railway tracks.

The area in which SECH operates amounts to 205,000 square metres, with a 526-metre
quay, which allows the simultaneous berthing of two ships, compatibly with their length,
while the depth at berth is equal to -15 m. The area is bordered to the north by the
ferry terminal, to the south by the railway junction and the landfilling of Calata Bettolo,
to the west with the road networks, the Lanterna promenade and some buildings
pertaining to port activities, to the east with the area of Genoa Sampierdarena. There
is a dangerous goods stacking area with a capacity of 549 TEUs. The covered area
amounts to approximately 4,000 square metres, used for offices, changing rooms and
workshops.

In the acoustic zoning plan of the municipality of Genoa, the area in which SECH
operates falls into class VI “transport infrastructure areas”, with the highest emission and
release limits, both day and night.The neighbouring areas belong to Class V (Lanterna)
and Class IV (ferry terminal). Being a port area, there are no residential receptors.
