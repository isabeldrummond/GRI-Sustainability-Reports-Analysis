The acoustic emissions contribution of SECH activities is mainly due to
the handling and storage operations of the containers, as well as the
mechanical workshop. Loading and unloading activities are carried out
both during the day and at night, while workshop activities take place
mainly during the day.The municipality of Genoa classified the municipal
territory according to the criteria set by art. 4, paragraph 1, letter a) of
Law 26/10/1995, n. 447, and the same was approved by the province of
Genoa on 21/11/2001. On the basis of the acoustic classification of the
territory of the municipality of Genoa, the area concerned falls into class
VI “zones belonging to transport infrastructures”, with emission and input
limits, provided for by the Ministerial Decree dated 14/11/1997, equal to
65 CB (A) for emissions and 70 dB (A) for inputs, both day and night. The
neighbouring areas belong to Class V (Lanterna) and Class IV (ferry
terminal). Since it is a port area, there are no residential receptors.

The auditing of daytime noise made by a specialised company during
2016 showed that the activity does not exceed the limit values set
forth. Below are the location of the measurement points and the data
collected.
