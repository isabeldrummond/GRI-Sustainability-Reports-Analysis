of ozone-depleting substances (ODS)*®. At SECH, the power supply for the heating plant
used for the heating of sanitary water for the changing rooms is natural gas, whereas
in TDT is diesel.

Pursuant to Presidential Decree 74/2013, all systems are equipped with “system
booklets”, both for thermal power plants and air conditioners. Energy efficiency reports
are made at each thermal season, or every two, depending on the periodicity imposed
by the legislation.

EC Regulation 2037/2000 (implemented in Italy by Presidential Decree 147 of 2006)
banned, since 2012, the placing on the market and the filling in case of losses of R22
gas. The subsequent Regulation (EC) 517/2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases aims
to further reduce the emissions of these gases through a variety of measures: rules
relating to the containment, use, recovery and destruction of fluorinated greenhouse
gases, conditions regarding the placing on the market of certain types of products
or devices that contain or are based on fluorinated greenhouse gases (prohibitions),
specific uses of these gases (prohibition of maintenance together with some gases),
quantitative limits of placement on the HFC” market (elimination).

Consequently, at TDT, starting from 2008, a programme to replace machines filled with
R22 (completed in 2012) was started with machines with R410-410° gas, while from
2019 machines with gas with a lower impact will be purchased, such as envisaged by
the Kindall protocol amending the Kyoto protocol. As for SECH, eight R22-refrigerant gas-
carrying machines continue to be operational, which will be progressively replaced
without maintenance/filling, as permitted by legislation. For these appliances, whose
quantity of gas does not fall within the dictates of Presidential Decree 43/2012, the
system booklet is maintained, pursuant to the previous Presidential Decree 147/2006,
in order to ascertain the absence of losses. In 2019, a unit located at the EDP room
of the administrative building was removed, so the total number of R22 gas-carrying
equipment dropped to seven.

Starting from January 24", 2019, the Presidential Decree n. 146/2018, implementing the
EU regulation no. 517/2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases, repeals and replaces the
Presidential Decree n. 43/2012. This entails the termination of the obligation relating
to the communication to ISPRA, by May 31% of each year, of information regarding
the quantities of emissions of fluorinated gases into the atmosphere (the so-called
“F-Gas declaration").To replace this requirement, a data bank was set up (article 16 of
Presidential Decree no.146/2018) on the collection and storage of information relating
to leakage control activities, as well as installation, assistance, maintenance, repair,
dismantling of equipment containing fluorinated greenhouse gases. Starting from
September 24", 2019, following the first useful intervention for leak control, maintenance,
assistance, repair and/or dismantling of the equipment already installed on the date
of entry into force of the Presidential Decree n. 146/2018, the terminals, through their
suppliers, have communicated electronically to the new database the mandatory
information required by the new regulations.

It should be noted that, unlike the previous legislation, all the machines carrying gas
are involved, and not only those that exceed 3kg or 5Tons of CO,,.

The following table shows a detail of the situation at SECH and TDT as of 31/12/2019,
also containing data on the tons of CO,.

Below is the list of machines in the two terminals, including those installed on lifting
equipment.

28. Ozone-Depleting Substances, mainly of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) responsible for ozone layer
thinning.
29. HFC: Coolant fluid.
