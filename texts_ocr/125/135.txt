ny fundamental and essential factor for the development of both terminals.

the necessary skills to offer a quality service to customers: it is managed
a by the HR department, which also oversees relations with schools,

aT

universities and employment centres.

the principles of the Code of Ethics adopted both by SECH and TDT, as
eet well as of the labour law, the national collective labour agreements (i.e.
we § ports and managers of industrial companies national agreements)
in all their disciplined institutions and in strict compliance with the
requirements established by law.

Tan The policy of both companies guarantees equal opportunities for men
Ui feet and women in accessing employment, without any discrimination on
Ne grounds of sex, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, political opinions,
», sexual orientation, personal and social conditions, in line with the
applicable legislation and, in particular, with the equal opportunities

code (Legislative Decree 198/06).

 

Human resources are hired solely on the basis of regular employment contracts, no
form of irregular employment being tolerated, neither for Italian citizens nor foreigners.

relationship.

The recognition of salary increases or other incentive instruments and access to higher
roles and assignments (promotions) are linked, in addition to the rules established by
the law and by the sector collective employment contract, to the individual merits of
the workers, among which are the ability to express organisational behaviours and
skills based on the ethical principles of reference of the companies.
