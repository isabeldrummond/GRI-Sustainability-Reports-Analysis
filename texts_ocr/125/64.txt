As regards the coverage of retirement costs, there are no defined benefit company
plans, nor do the companies offer their employees specific supplementary pension
coverage, in addition to that provided for by the national collective agreement,
introduced starting from 2005, and currently identified in the Priamo pension fund,
to which all employees can adhere by including the severance indemnity accrued,
with an additional employee-company equal contribution of 1% of the remuneration
elements, valid for the calculation of the severance pay (TFR).

In addition to the statutory retirement plans guaranteed by the payment of the
mandatory national social welfare institution (INPS) contributions, upon termination of
the employment relationship the severance indemnity is therefore recognised to those
who have not joined the supplementary pension scheme, whereas the possibility of
receiving a life annuity and/or a redemption of the accrued pension position from the
Priamo fund is granted to those who have adhered to it.

Furthermore, in some particular cases, the advance notice of indemnity is paid to the
employee.

The composition and movements of employee severance indemnities and other
personnel funds at December 31", 2019 are detailed below:
