A word from
our Chairman

) FOREWORD

 

 

ie It is now a year on from issuing our first Sustainability Report for SECH and

" TDT, and | write this introduction to the second report in the knowledge
LT | | that the world is now a very different place.The Covid-19 crisis has shown
us many things, perhaps for the first time in the lives of many.

On the downside, we have seen how fragile our public health can be when faced
by an invisible, and deadly, threat. Not only has the physical health of communities
worldwide been threatened, but mental health has also become a widespread issue.
And of course, the economic impact of the pandemic has been devastating.

However, there have also been upsides to the crisis. Communities, and even whole
populations, have come together in lockdown. Pollution has reduced and the
environment has benefited. Even politicians have worked together! And it is now more
clear than ever that we depend on a whole class of “key workers” - those who work
in healthcare, those who keep our public services running, and those who work in
businesses considered essential to the economy.

am proud to say that both SECH and TDT are considered amongst those businesses
hat are essential to the regional and national economy. And they have operated
hroughout the crisis thanks to the commitment of many people. In particular, it has
been good to see how well the business teams have managed to create safe and
healthy working conditions for everyone.

The health and safety record for the business reflects the wider initiatives and objectives
hat are the subject of this second Sustainability Report. Managing the impact on
our environment is also rapidly becoming a major cultural issue for all of us, as is the
importance of diversity. | know that these remain priorities for your Board of Directors
and | thank you for all your efforts fo make SECH and TDT safe, clean and fair places
io work. | would also like to acknowledge the continued efforts of Giulio Schenone, our
CEO, and in particular the commitments made by those who lead the sustainability
teams: Paola Cavassa (SECH), Tiziana Gianuzzi (SECH) and Federica Tommasi (TDT).
Your investors consider the first Sustainability Report to be “best in class” and we would
ike to keep it that way.

The Chairman of the Board of Directors IN l
