Consumption of electricity, water and methane is also monitored; as regards electricity,
in particular, the withdrawal curves are available for download from the portal of the
energy supplier, whose progress can also be observed at group level, through the GIP
purchasing function. Unfortunately, it is still necessary to implement the setting up of
separate metres by type of user (lighting, reefer units, equipment), which would allow
targeted analysis to be carried out and to evaluate the incidence of the actions taken,
the effect of which is drowned in general consumption, which in recent years was
affected by the increase in temperature-controlled containers.

Replacement of lights typology

With regard to the operating area, the result of the work carried out between 2016 and
2019 is reported below.

e RMGs: in the two-year period 2016-2017, 20 new LED projectors were mounted on
each of the 6 revamped cranes, which absorb a power of 138W, while previously
each crane was equipped with 24x250W projectors on the fixed structure and
5x400W under the trolley, all of the SON-T high pressure sodium vapor type. Savings
achieved around 31kW.

SSGCs (PT): 22 projectors are mounted on the quay cranes: 6 under the carriage,
7 on the fixed beam, 5 on the mobile boom and 4 on the lower crossbars used as
street lighting for port tractors. These were all 1O00W SON-T sodium vapor lamps
nonetheless, after having tested the suitability for the operators, the 6 ones on the
trolley and the 4 on the crossbars were largely replaced with Storm Marine LED 235W
diffused light projectors in 2019 on each crane. Savings achieved around 38kW.

Lighting towers (TF): originally 11 light towers were located in the terminal,
equipped with 100 traditional 1OOOW SON-T projectors (total power 100 kW). Since
2017, replacement interventions have been completed with the modernisation of
the light towers and, in 2019, work was also done on the projectors. At the end of
the interventions in the terminal there are 9 LED light towers that mount a total of
80x455W LED projectors, to which must be added 2 that still mount 15 traditional
floodlights. The power was therefore reduced to 51.4 kW with a saving of 68.6 kW.

As regards the office area, during 2018 the terminal concluded the replacement of the
neon lights used for internal lighting with 36W and 18W powers in both buildings. The
intervention concerned all the ceiling lights with fluorescent tubes, which were replaced
with LED technology tubes. The 10 250W SON-T projectors of the administrative building
roof with 145W LED (saving about 1kW) and those of the company parking lot (18
mercury vapor lights of 1S5OW with 16 LED of 120W plus 4 of 145W) were simultaneously
replaced with a saving of about 200W.

Replacement of vehicles and equipment

Since 2015, SECH fleet has been progressively integrated with four new reachstackers,
model CVS F500 series, whose salient feature is to be eco-compatible, since they are
designed to reduce NO, nitrogen oxide emissions at the exhaust, through the Selective
Catalytic Reduction system (SCR), which works by adding urea to the exhaust gases.
For this reason the reachstackers must be periodically supplied with a liquid called
“DEF" Diesel Exhaust Fluid - reducing liquid (urea) - which is therefore stored in a tank,
located at yard, in front of the workshop. Instead, the replacement of the washing
system with a more modern and efficient one is scheduled for 2020.
