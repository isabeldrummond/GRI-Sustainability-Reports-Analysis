The reduction in total emissions is also due in TDT to energy efficiency actions. The fact

hat electricity is 100% from renewable sources and not only 43% is not quantified.

Both terminals also conducted an environmental survey aimed at portraying the air
quality in terms of concentration of dust, volatile organic compounds and combustion
umes, conducted during normal terminal activities, in order to evaluate worker

exposure to the various chemical compounds deriving from the emissions produced
by the combustion exhausts of the terminal operating vehicles, from the degradation
of the road surface and tire consumption, from the fumes coming from the vessels at
berth and from the filling tanks.

Below is the list of agents considered:
e Carbon monoxide (CO);

e particulate (PM,,);

e breathable dust:

e nitrogen dioxide (NO,);

e sulfur dioxide (SO,).

The deviation from the TLV (Threshold Limit Value”) of the various substances being
evaluated was assessed and, as regards the gases, the verification to show how many
times the value equal to one tenth of the TLV was exceeded during sampling was
carried out. For the dusts the results obtained were compared with the reference values
(the TLV as regards breathable dusts and the limits referred to urban areas as per
Ministerial Decree dated 25/11/1994 concerning PM,,,).The following table summarises
the reference values on which the assessments were based:

 

23. Considered in the total amount.

24. They refer to the environmental concentrations of airborne chemicals and indicate the
concentrations below which it is believed that most workers can be exposed repeatedly day after day,
for a working life, without adverse health effects.
