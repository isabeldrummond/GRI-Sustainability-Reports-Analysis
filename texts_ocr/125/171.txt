As emerges from the data analysis, over the years, the most frequently occurring case
history is linked to the “ascending, descending, walking” macro-category, followed, in

 

2019, by the “falling/tumbling’” cases, tl
the victim walks, descends a stair or a

hat is, the cases of accidents which occur while
n operating vehicle or climbs up there. It should

be noted that it is precisely in this area, mostly linked to the behavioural aspect, that
the management system focusses its interventions; over the years, the reduction in
accidents is linked precisely to the clear improvement that the workplace health and
safety management system has brought to this area.
