At TDT, on the other hand, 60% of total energy needs are covered by electricity and the
remaining 40% comes from diesel. Of the electricity consumption, 46% is due to the
supply of temperature-controlled containers (stored at the terminal, awaiting loading
or withdrawal), 33% from the quay cranes consumption and the remainder from the
sum of the yard lighting and office activities, as shown in the graph below. In 2019,
electricity consumption for lighting was reduced by 46%, thanks to the replacement of
the sodium lights of the light towers with LED lights at the end of 2018.
