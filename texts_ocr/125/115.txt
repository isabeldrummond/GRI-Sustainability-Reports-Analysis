SECH is located within the port of Genoa in the Sampierdarena basin, at
Calata Sanita, in a port area easily accessible from the open sea, whose
distance does not exceed 2 miles. The area is bordered to the north by
the ferry terminal, to the south by the railway junction and the land filling
of Calata Bettolo, to the west by the port road network, the “Lanterna’ (i.e.
lighthouse) promenade and some buildings pertaining to port activities,
and finally to the east by the docks of Genoa Sampierdarena.

The area falls (from the acoustic point of view) in Class VI “exclusively
industrial areas”, the visual impact involves SECH the highest installations
(quay cranes), visible from the urban context adjacent to the port.

The terminal is in fact equipped with 5 quay cranes (called PTs), 6 RMGs
at yard (called TTs) and 6 RTGs. In order to operate on ever larger ships, as
required by the evolution of the maritime container market, in the recent
past SECH undertook an investment programme on the five quay cranes,
with the extension of the boom of four of them, allowing them to operate
on the vessel the containers stowed in the twentieth row sea side, so as
to be able to work large ships (14.000 TEUs). Another change that led
to an increase in the visual impact is represented by the raising of the
bays at yard from the 3’ to the 4’ tier, with the consequent revamping of
the 6 RMGs, in order to have an extra position for every single cell of the
storage areas involved and therefore expand the storage capacity and
the receptive capacity of the terminal by about 1.500 containers.
