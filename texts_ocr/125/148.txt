Such a control system allows the identification of non-compliant services and activities
and is mainly divided into:

FIRST- AND SECOND-PARTY AUDITS (on the main suppliers), conducted by trained and
in-house internal personnel, and third-party audits conducted by independent and
accredited certification bodies. These verifications make it possible to ascertain the
compliance of the terminals with the voluntary OHSAS 18001:2007 standard and to
ascertain any non-conformities and/or recommendations for the improvement of the
company health and safety performances;

PERIODIC AND SYSTEMATIC INSPECTIONS OF WORK ENVIRONMENTS, carried out by
internal staff of the HSSE department, to ensure compliance with health and safety
requirements and conditions, in all places and in the performance of all corporate
activities;

EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAININGS planned to test the possible emergency scenarios
identified by the two terminals, in order to assess the effectiveness of the intervention
plans and the preparation of the assigned personnel. The multi-year planning of the
exercises is periodically reviewed on the basis of the results of the simulations carried
out and the actual emergency events. The results of the tests are managed from a
systemic perspective, through the identification, where necessary, of actions aimed at
improving the response to the various events that may occur;

PERIODIC INSPECTIONS BY THE COMPETENT DOCTOR to ascertain that working
environments and conditions guarantee respect for the health and safety of the
operators;

ADOPTION OF MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT ENABLE THE FULFILLMENT OF MANDATORY
AND VOLUNTEER HEALTH AND SAFETY OBLIGATIONS and the controlled management
of any non-conformities detected, implementing all the corrective actions necessary to
restore the full effectiveness of the health and safety management system. The above
is particularly necessary also and especially in the case of accidents (injuries and
nearmiss), occupational diseases and damages, as a result of which the terminals
react immediately by starting the investigation activities indispensable to ensure a
timely reconstruction of the dynamics of events, allowing the search for the causes that
triggered them and their subsequent elimination, in order to avoid their recurrence.
