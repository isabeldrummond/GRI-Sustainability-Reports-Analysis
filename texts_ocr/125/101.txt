5.1.5.2 TDT NOISE EMISSIONS

Terminal Darsena Toscana site is located within the area of competence of the industrial
port, classified in the acoustic zoning plan of the territory, drawn up by the municipality
of Leghorn on the basis of Law 447/95 and L.R. 89/98, as “Class VI - exclusively industrial
areas”. In fact, there are no sensitive and/or vulnerable settlements in the immediate
vicinity of TDT. Nearby are only and exclusively other industrial facilities, related to the
typical activities of the port sector. The closest sensitive receptors are located several
hundred metres from the settlement area and all see the interposition of other activities
that are always part of the port area. All the neighbouring areas are classified as Class
V or Class VI. Consequently, referring to the table and following map, the limits to be
respected at the receptors are the following:

Il Mainly residential areas

Ill Mixed Type Areas (yellow)

IV Areas of intense human activity (orange)

V Predominantly industrial areas (red)

VI Exclusively industrial areas (blue)

The assessments relating to the
acoustic impact produced by the
activities taking place inside the
terminal were evaluated according
to the provisions of law 447/95, in
relation to the acoustic classification
of the territory. The last assessment
carried out by the Port Authority in
the whole state area was in 2018,
while it was carried out by the
terminal in 2019, having passed
10 years from the previous one,
and some sound sources having
changed: the investigation did not
anyway detect values of emissions
and acoustic differential (in classes
where applicable) beyond the limit
levels.

The assessments relating to the expo-
sure of workers to noise are carried
out at least every four years or follow-
ing to changes in the activities.
