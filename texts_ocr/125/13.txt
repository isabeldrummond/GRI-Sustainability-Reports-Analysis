SECH and TDT manage numerous types of risk, connected to the conduct
of their business, which, if not properly monitored, can potentially
generate significant economic, financial, equity, social, environmental
and reputational impacts, deteriorating the corporate image towards
the Stakeholders.

It is therefore essential for the two companies to have internal control
and management systems capable of recognising, preventing and in
any case minimising the impacts of all the risks inherent in carrying out
their activities, ensuring the effectiveness of the actions taken, as well as
compliance with the mandatory regulations.

Gruppo Investimenti Portuali has therefore adopted a set of rules,
procedures and organisational structures aimed at allowing the
identification, measurement, management and monitoring of the
main risks, also determining their degree of acceptability through a
management consistent with the strategic objectives identified.

The architecture of the internal control and management system of SECH
and TDT is based on the following principles:

e Separation of roles and duties, the aim of which is to reduce the risk of
fraud and errors, and is achieved through the division of the activities/
responsibilities relating to a specific business process between
different functions/individuals;

e the accountability of information and processes, understood as the
attribution of responsibility to a subject (or group of subjects);

e traceability of data and information.

All this has been translated into an integrated management system
compliant with the UNI EN ISO 9001:2015 (quality management system),
UNI ISO 45001:2018 (health and safety management system) and UNI
ISO 37001:2016 standards (anti-corruption management system).

In 2019, in particular, the terminals adopted the management system
on. a voluntary basis, compliant with the international standard UNI
ISO 45001:2018. Adherence to this standard allows, with a view to
continuous improvement, to identify, adopt, monitor and possibly modify
the measures necessary to organise and prepare healthy and safe
workplaces, prevent work-related injuries and diseases and continuously
improve health and safety benefits.

Following to the transition from BS OHSAS 18001:2007 to UNI ISO
45001:2018, SECH and TDT have implemented a new risk and opportunity
assessment based on Stakeholders, for all related health and safety
aspects and impacts. During 2019 SECH and TDT obtained the UNI ISO
45001:2018 certification.
