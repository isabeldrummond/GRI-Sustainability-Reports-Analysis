5.1.6 Emissions in the atmosphere

5.1.6.1 DIFFUSE EMISSIONS

Pe The entire area of the terminals is affected by the presence of diffuse

emissions, mainly attributable to:

e Exhaust gas emissions from handling equipment;

 

e methane, sulphates and other emissions from purification plants
Pastis il
Pas (only for TDT).

ea

To such emissions the following ones add up from neighbouring activities
upstream and downstream of the process (treated in the indirect aspects
section, paragraph 5.2), like:

 

Pa

19 sem e Exhaust gas emissions from vessels, trucks and trains in transit;

e diffuse dust emissions from the filling operations of the reclaiming tank
with dredging sludge (TDT only).

(re) §—CO, emissions related to diffuse direct and indirect emissions due to
diesel and electricity consumption are quantified and reported in
paragraph 5.1.6.1 “Diffuse emissions” (air pollutant).

= Emissions related to diffuse direct and indirect emissions due to the
itn consumption of diesel and electricity can be quantified in terms of
emission of tons of CO,equivalent and greenhouse gases.

 

The production of these substances depends, in addition to the type of diesel used, on
he conditions of use and the technologies used (especially with reference to NM-VOC,
CO, PM)"; it is therefore recalled how the reported values are useful at an indicative
level to evaluate the trend over time, in order to have an indication on the polluting
potential of the equipment, even if they may differ significantly from the real emissions
into the atmosphere. The plurality of equipment types and conditions of use does not
currently allow a more accurate estimate for the purposes of the report.

The terminals intervened (where possible for budgets, types of vehicles available on
he market and fuel available on site) by replacing the older vehicles with new vehicles
(cranes and reachstackers for TDT, reachstackers for SECH), designed to reduce NO,
nitrogen emissions at the exhaust, through the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)
system, which works by adding urea to the exhaust gases.

Below are some tables showing the quantification of pollutant emissions deriving from
he combustion of diesel engines of yard equipment. The calculation of the emissions
was estimated using standard emission factors reported in “EMEP / EEA - Emission
nventory Guidebook 2013" published by the EEA".

 

17.NM-VOC: non-methane volatile organic compounds; CO: carbon monoxide; PM: particulate matter.
