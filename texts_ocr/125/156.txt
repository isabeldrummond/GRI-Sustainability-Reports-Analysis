6.6.1 SECH approach

Pre For 2019, with a view to continuously improving health and safety
aT

performance, SECH has undertaken the following initiatives:

ee » WORKERS’ COMMUNICATION,
eT Tt LE PARTICIPATION AND INVOLVEMENT

e In November 2019 a new monitor was installed

in the dining room below the office of the
(Hie operations superintendents, which adds up to

ma the two monitors installed in the dining areas of
both terminal buildings. In this way, the company
communication channels aimed at workers have been further
enhanced, as it is now also possible from this area, crowded by
employees and third party workers, who in various times intervene in the terminal, to
view the contents projected within the company schedule. The display of the wind
conditions status always appears on a second monitor, which has been integrated
into the corporate network, an aspect that should guarantee better reliability in the
event of breakdowns and blackouts, since the IT department can also intervene
remotely;

 

 

the meetings of the “improvement groups” took place from December 2018 and
February 2019, an initiative requested by most of the resources, who expressed their
willingness to be more involved and informed on the different aspects

of the company business. This project allowed colleagues from

different departments to meet and create synergies favouring

collaboration, with the aim of obtaining better performing

business results, in a context that becomes increasingly

challenging and competitive. In this sense, each resource

participated in the activities envisaged by the “improvement

groups”, within which everyone had the opportunity to share

information and ideas, to bring solutions aimed at improving

productivity, climate and organisation in the departments

where each of them operates every day. The feedback from

the participants was positive, in fact the unanimous request was to keep up the
meetings, but, above alll, to follow up on the proposals that emerged during the
classroom works, through an activity of collecting and organising all the comments
received. Therefore, an analysis and planning process was launched, aimed at
implementing the improvement proposals, the implementation phase of which is
constantly updated and communicated through various methods, such as the
company newsletter and a series of monitors that have been installed in different
terminal locations;

»> PPE

Always with a view to continuous improvement, in 2019 the purchase of safety shoes
was re-evaluated with the company RLS, directing the choice towards a more durable
and robust model. The electrical maintenance personnel was also equipped with
better gloves for protection during work under voltage or in the vicinity up to 500 V.
A pneumatic verifier was purchased for these devices, in order to carry out their six-
monthly testing.
