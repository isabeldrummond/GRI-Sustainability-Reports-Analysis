During 2019 the total number of training hours carried out at SECH remained in line
with the previous years and concerned almost all the resources in force.

 

It is useful to highlight that the hours of managerial training and professional updating
are an expression of the company’s will, while the hours of safety training are also
mandatory. In fact, for the year 2020, various training activities are planned, some of
which deriving from the obligations established by the State-Regions Agreements on
health and safety in the workplace.

In 2019, a potential assessment process began, aimed at a small group of figures
belonging to SECH and TDT, with the aim of identifying strengths, areas for improvement
and the possibility of developing their human resources to enhance their growth paths.
The first training courses in this regard, as far as SECH is concerned, started in October.

Continuing a journey that has been going on for years now, SECH’s commitment to
training and prevention has continued. The number of emergency workers has grown
and it has become more necessary than ever to carry their path in terms of first training
or compulsory updating.

Also with regard to safety, SECH, after the purchase of three external semi-automatic
AED"®, organised a course for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation with
AED for 36 people, three of which are workers’ safety representatives (RLS).

The electrical maintenance area has been the subject of various training and updating
courses: on the maintenance of MV/MV and MV/LV electrical substations, on inverters
and on the Profibus data transmission protocol.

In order to identify improvement actions to manage operating activities more effectively,
and thus obtain the highest degree of satisfaction among customers and maintain
competitiveness with contending container terminals, SECH, in the two-year period
2018 and 2019, organised a series of meetings with workers, dividing them into groups
and listening to their opinions, in order to achieve the intended goal.

Confirming what happened in the recent past, also in 2019, English language courses
were provided at TILC (The International Language Center), attended by SECH staff
from various departments.
