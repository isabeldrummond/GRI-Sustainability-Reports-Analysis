The test phase of the SCADA project was completed (upgrading
of the electricity grid, distribution, automation of the electrical
substations, redundancy and selectivity of the lines, research and
selective isolation in the event of faults).

Replaced the oil transformer in the electrical substation with another
resin one, with the definition of a specific sectioning procedure and
adjustments for access, signaling and safety distances.

New equipment purchased: two 36-T goosenecks with safety hooks,
a device for automatic OOG handling and a 60-foot roll trailer.

Made changes to the layout of the terminal for the inspections
on goods, with the adaptation of the separating fence of the
terminal from the public road and by tracing a roundabout to allow
maneuvers to enter and exit to the vehicles.

Layout improvement of module 1, with an increase in space for
maneuvering the vehicles, as well as identifying and tracing a single
block of ten storage areas for empty containers.

New layout for modules 5 and 6 defined following the configuration for
container cycles of the area, previously destined for rolling stock traffic.
