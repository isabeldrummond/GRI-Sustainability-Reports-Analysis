e PCB/PCT*: elimination and progressive replacement of oil transformers with resin
transformers (two in 2018 and 2019);

e reduction of ozone depleting gases (F-gas): progressive replacement of all air
conditioners with R22 from 2008 to 2012 and replacement from 2019 of those with
R410A with refrigerant gases with a lower environmental impact, as required by the
Kindall protocol;

e waste: there is an improvement in the organisation of the storage areas, due to
monitoring activities, calls where possible, training and information for internal and
external staff, inclusion of contractual liability clauses in the contracts, signposts
prohibiting access;

e water consumption: checked monthly through metre monitoring, anomaly
detection, leak detection, installation of flow reducers in the yard showers.

Impact reductions are demonstrated by a series of cross-integrated data:

e The trend of performance indicators (consumption and emissions) which
demonstrate an improvement in all energy performance indicators thanks to the
aforementioned actions carried out.

n this case it is noted that the aggregated data, i.e. inclusive of reefer consumption
(which represent more than 50% of total electricity consumption without being linked
io company performance) and of Port Authority's lighthouse towers consumption,

however, indicate a reduction. See the dedicated table in paragraph 5.1.6.1 for further
details;

e from the specific energy and economic savings of some savings actions;
e the reduction of non-conformities;

e from the production of economic savings from what were previously only costs (see
analysis of costs and savings by individual aspect reported in paragraph 5.3.2).

 

36.PCB/PCT: polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorotrophenyls, are chlorinated synthetic compounds
extensively used, since the 1930s, in the electrotechnical sector as insulators.
