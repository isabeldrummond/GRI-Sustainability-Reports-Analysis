 

5.2 INDIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

i The indirect environmental impacts are due to activities related to those

of the terminals and delegated to third parties or linked to subjects
upstream and downstream of the main processes, i.e. along the
production chain.

Peau Such activities are as follows:
aa ee

e Maintenance of mechanical and lifting equipment;

e tyre maintenance;

 

ae e support to handling/transport;
Bay

(exe) e shuttle transport service to/from the quay, yards and rail areas;
e port services on board the vessels (lashing/unlashing on board);

eeu e maneuvers of railway wagons;

re e empty stock management;

e controls/inspections (accesses, gate technical inspection, reefer);
e gate private security for entrance and night access;

e plugging/unplugging/reefer monitoring activities;

e office cleaning;

e cleaning yards and waste disposal;

e vehicle washing;

e in/out flows of transport by truck/rail/vessel;

e commuting of employees home/work;

e flows of visitors and suppliers in/out of the terminals.

On all such activities, the management control level of the terminals is indirect and
depends on the influence that the companies have on that particular process
or supplier: on the processes and activities carried out internally on the site, the
terminals have a greater level of control (for example, on contractual clauses, audits,
inspections, etc.), while for activities held outside the terminal areas (e.g. transport
to/from the terminals) the power of intervention is not significant, since the activities
are independent of the core business and outside the area of influence of the two
organisations.

All suppliers operating at SECH must be previously qualified and periodically evaluated,
in compliance with the procedures of the quality management system in force. These
procedures have been progressively integrated with environmental controls, since
the adoption of the organisational and management model pursuant to Legislative
Decree 231/2001. Among the usual suppliers, particular attention was paid to the
transporters and waste disposers, for which at each intervention the compliance with
the requisites required by current legislation is assessed. The other resident suppliers
are regulated by specific contractual clauses. Any anomaly found is managed as a
system non-conformity. There are no consumption data relating to the activities carried
out by suppliers operating at SECH.

The significant environmental aspects linked to the activities pertaining to the supply
chain at TDT are framed within the environmental analysis and evaluated exactly as
the direct ones.
