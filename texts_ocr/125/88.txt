Through note prot. 55541/2011 the province of Genoa - Environment Department,
Water Office - expressed a technical opinion on the documentation presented by the
terminal, communicating the exclusion from the field of application of the Regional
Regulation 4/2009, thus eliminating SECH’s activity from the regulatory discipline of run-
off waters. SECH treats the spills and the leakages of the containers, preventing the
outflow of wastewater into the receptor bodies, through the use of collection tanks
and or the intervention of specialised companies to confine the area, apply absorbent
substances and dispose of the waste product, in compliance with the current
legislation.

5.1.2.2 TDT WATER DISCHARGE

Pe The water discharges originating from the activities carried out inside TDT
terminal are both domestic (toilets) and industrial (vehicle washing).

me The wastewater, previously treated within the five purification plants,

is released into the sea (surface water), except in one case, with the

Petri) introduction into the soil.
eA)

 

In 2015 all the authorisations were included in the Single Environmental

[o Authorisation (AUA) with a fortnightly expiry. The company is required to
ensure the correct operation of the plants and, in order to communicate

feat any changes and to this end, enters into a contract every year for the
aT) maintenance of the treatment plants and waste analysis, every four
(ee) months, as well as for interventions in the event of malfunctions and

extraordinary assessments.

an Possible malfunctions and deviations from the quality objectives have
been managed with extraordinary maintenance, outdoor emptying,
washing and adjustments.

 

Roof (AMD) and yards’ (AMPP) run-off waters are currently not collected, as the
activities carried out by TDT are not included among those required by law. Spills and
pouring of liquids to the ground are managed and quoted on time, in order not to
allow their outflow to the sea, through the use of mobile containment tanks and/or
the intervention of specialised companies to confine the area, apply the absorbent
substance and dispose of the waste produced, in compliance with current legislation.
