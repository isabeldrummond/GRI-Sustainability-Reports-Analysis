5.1 DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

The direct environmental impacts derive from ship/rail/truck unloading and loading
activities and from upstream and downstream accessory ones.

They are flanked by indirect environmental impacts, connected to the activities of
internal and external suppliers and customers and on which the terminals have an
indirect and variable power of intervention.

In light of the above, we can consider the following significant direct environmental
aspects related to the terminal activity:

e Resource consumption;

e water discharge;

e waste production;

e discharges to the ground;

e noise emissions;

emissions in the atmosphere:
» diffuse emissions;

» conveyed emissions;

electromagnetic emissions;

e light emissions;

visual impacts;

ionising radiations;

e odorous emissions.

lt should be recalled in this regard that the terminals are not subject to the constraints
deriving from the Kyoto Protocol or to emission trading schemes.

5.1.1 Resource consumption

The resources mainly consumed within the terminals are:
e Energy resources;
e water;

e material derived from raw materials of various kinds (e.g. paper, office equipment,
installations, etc.).
