6.9 SECURITY

Fea Security management in SECH and TDT has always been of paramount
cain importance, in consideration of the fact that the terminals are exposed
: to potential thefts as well as attempts to cross the threshold by illegal

eS immigrants.

Following the tragic event of September 11th, 2001 and the issuing in 2004 of the
International Security Code - ISPS Code, the terminals further raised their level of
attention, also aimed at managing potential terrorist attacks.

SECH and TDT terminals provide specific training to all internal personnel with security
duties, in compliance with the provisions and requirements of international and
national regulations, and carry out familiarisation interventions with all the rest of the
company personnel, in order to obtain the greatest awareness possible of the issues
or all employees.

The guidelines to which SECH and TDT refer to for the provision of the aforementioned
security training activities are the IMO Model Course 3.24 and 3.25 - designed to
acilitate the adoption of the International Convention on training, certification and
performance standards Marine Guard (STCW) of 1978 - and ISPS Code sheet 6 of the
National Maritime Security Program (PNSM).

As a company rule and as required by the reference standards, also the companies
providing security services must operate at the terminals with staff duly trained under
he ISPS Code.

tt should also be noted that the code of ethics of the two organisations, in addition to
identifying the set of values that represent corporate social ethics, contain the guiding
principles that must be complied with by all those who directly or indirectly establish
relationships with SECH and TDT.

n fact, these individuals, each within the scope of their responsibilities, according to the
principles of sound and prudent management and in compliance with national and
EU laws, as well as policies, plans, regulations, and internal procedures, must contribute
fo the achievement of the corporate mission and must also report to the supervisory
body, set up together with the adoption of the organisational model pursuant to
legislative decree 231/2001, all useful information on any deficiencies in the controls,
reprehensible behaviour or founded suspicions of “bad management”.

By way of example, some of the ethical principles adopted by the terminals and
specifically referable to the exercise of security activities are cited: responsibility and
compliance with laws, impartiality, integrity, protection of privacy and individual
personality, repudiating any manifestation of violence, especially if aimed at limiting
personal freedom.

n particular, as regards security checks on people and their personal effects, these
are carried out respecting the fundamental rights and dignity of the human person,
respecting gender and different cultural and religious sensitivities.

The supervisory bodies existing in both terminals perform periodic assessments on the
company work, so that the applicable and internal voluntarily adopted rules, such as
he code of ethics, are always respected.

 

With regard to the SECH terminal, to date, the percentage of personnel performing
specific security duties and trained in human rights matters is 100%.
