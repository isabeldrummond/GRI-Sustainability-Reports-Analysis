DISTRIBUTION OF VALUE
- ECONOMIC IMPACTS

The economic impact of SECH and TDT does not end with the production and
distribution of added value; the focus of the two companies is not, in fact, only to
produce profits for the shareholders, nonetheless also to create job opportunities and
economic growth for the local community.

As regards infrastructures, the two organisations concentrated, in particular, on
interventions aimed at improving productivity and raising safety levels within the
terminals, improving the working conditions of the personnel.

Update in the electrical substation switches: modernisation with
latest generation switches for a better reliability and continuity of
service.

DURING 2019

Replacement of the projectors of the lighting towers of the container
trolleys with high efficiency LED lamps, both to obtain energy savings
and for greater safety in the area.

Revamping of the RTG called FO2 for the modernisation of trolley,
lifting and cabin translation, in order to improve the reliability and
continuity of railway operations.

MADE BY

Purchase of a new automatic fixed OOG spreader.

Purchase of two new reachstackers to enhance the vehicle fleet.

Purchase and installation of operating cameras and systems to
improve WiFi coverage and, consequently, the operational efficiency
of the control room office.

New video system for RTGs with installation of four 2 Moixel IP
cameras with dedicated IR, that provide better visibility to operators
during handling and therefore greater efficiency and safety.

A building was created for the border inspection station (PIF), for
goods of animal origin and designated entry point (PED) for the
verification of goods of vegetal origin, by the peripheral structures of
the Ministry of Health.
