TDT has also adhered to the voluntary ISO 14001:2015 standard (environmental
management system), while SECH has initiated all the activities necessary to implement
he enactment of this system, periodically assessing its degree of compliance.

The group has also adopted the organisation, management and control model
pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01 and management of the security of sensitive
and personal data pursuant to law 196/2003, integrated with the changes introduced
by Legislative Decree dated 10" August 2018, n. 101.

The ethical code that both SECH (since 2011) and TDT (since 2012) have adopted is
he testimony of a daily work consistent with the principles of correctness, honesty and
legality, which are some of the guiding values of those who work and collaborate with
both organisations, aimed at avoiding any action dictated by improper or personal
reasons.

Furthermore, in compliance with the provisions of the ISPS code (International Maritime
Safety Code for Ships and Port infrastructures), which entered into force on 1* July 2004,
SECH and TDT have developed a security plan which provides for the preparation,
prevention and response procedures for each scenario evaluated in the PFSP (Port
Facility Security Assessment).

n addition to the above, both companies obtained the AEOF (Authorised Economic
Operator Full) certification, indispensable to balance the need for greater control and
security of shipments with the need to facilitate legitimate trade.

This system is periodically subjected to evaluation and review, in relation to the evolution
of business operations and the context of reference.

 

The supervisory bodies in both terminals also carry out periodic assessments on the
companies’ work, so that the applicable mandatory and voluntary rules are always
respected, such as the code of ethics and the management systems adopted.
