terminal are similar to domestic and industrial waste water, as they are

ae obtained by mixing water from toilets, including showers. The washing of

the vehicles takes place in a dedicated area served by a closed-cycle

CHEE treatment plant, which does not generate any discharge in the receptor

CSU bodies. SECH does not produce discharges to the sea: it uses four
[°| “Imhoff’!° type tanks downstream of the treatment process.

SECH uses the area on the basis of a concession stipulated with the Port

ee Authority on April 29", 1993 and subsequent amendments. At the time

Paar of signing the concession, two “Imhoff” pits were already in the area,

Oa)

(exe) serving the administrative and operational buildings and to date the Port

Authority has not yet transmitted the required authorisations, despite the
various reminders. To these the following two add up, of which evidence
ee of the authoritative situation is provided.

All the pits are periodically inspected and the waste is disposed of at least once a year
as CER 200304 waste, shown in the table in the waste section of this report (paragraph
5.1.3).

The washing system consists of an underground collection tank, which conveys the
washing water to a first oil-removal tank. Through successive passages in other tanks,
the material is increasingly purified, separating the solid components and neutralising
the polluting substances. At the end of the purification cycle, the purified water is
introduced into the circuit that feeds the vehicle washing system. The sludge deriving
from water purification is automatically pumped into a special separate tank for the
transfer as well as the purpose of their subsequent disposal. The area affected by the
washing operations is subject to cleaning by specialised personnel from an external
company. Maintenance and control over the operation of the plant are entrusted with a
regular contract to a specialised company, which carries out the assessments monthly.
