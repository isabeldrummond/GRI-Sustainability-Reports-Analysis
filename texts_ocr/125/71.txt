The new corporate structure of the two terminals also brought about synergies in the
choice of qualified suppliers; the set of expenses generated by common supplies is in
fact equal to 29% in the reference year and the goal is to reach 30-32% in 2020.

The strong link between SECH and TDT with the local area and their proximity to citizens
are also reflected in the choices to support non-profit organisations operating in local
contexts.

The following tables show the details of the amounts invested in the three-year period
by both companies.
