as it also affects the supplier chain. Working with principles and rules of sustainability
and with subjects who respect them provides more guarantees and minimizes risks. In
this sense, choosing only those suppliers who have undergone a certification process
means lowering the dangers of default and having more guarantees of seriousness
and compliance with the contracts. With obvious advantages on business continuity,
which is more unlikely to suffer interruptions related to failure to comply with the rules.

All with an increasing focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), which are substantial for the two terminals. Through various sustainability
initiatives, of which you can read in depth in the report, over the years steps have been
taken to address these objectives in various ways.
