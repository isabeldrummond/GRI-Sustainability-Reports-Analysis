5.1.8 Light emissions

OOOH At SECH the prevailing light emissions are made up of light towers, quay

cranes and yard RMGs. Specifically, 22 floodlights are mounted on the
quay cranes:

e Under the trolley, 235W LED with diffused light;
Pair © 7x 1000W traditional sodium vapour fixed beam (SON-1);

Bay

 

e 5x 1000W traditional sodium vapour moving beam (SON-T);

e 4x 145W LED on the lower cross beams of the prime movers for street
CLIMATE lighting;

otal)
e 78x 455W LED floodlights are set up on the 9 lighting towers, while two
still remain with traditional 1O00W SON-T floodlights, 18 in all;

e on the RMGs there are 20 new projectors on each crane, which
absorb a power of 138W.

To these must be added, as regards the external light emissions, the
10x145W LED floodlights on the roof of the administrative building and
the 16x120W plus 4x145W of the company parking lot.

At Terminal Darsena Toscana the light emission sources are represented
by 33 lighting towers and by the night lighting of the cranes, provided
for safety reasons to guarantee work during the night hours and for
signalling the area next to the flight corridor of the landing aircrafts at the
nearby city of Pisa.

 

All the lights are turned on and off by means of a twilight switch.

The lighting towers are located along the road that leads to the terminal as well as
inside the yard area and are distributed as follows:

e 120f 40m, located on the quay side (equipped with 12 asymmetric LED projectors);
e 16 0f 45 m, at yard (equipped with 12 asymmetric LED projectors);

e Sof 12m,on the railway junction (equipped with 4 adjustable projectors with 400W
lamps for each pole).

The replacement of the sodium vapour lamps with LED took place in 2018 on all the
tallest towers, while the ones on the five of the railway connection and on two cranes
were replaced in 2019.

In both terminals the intensity was adjusted according to the minimum requirements
for ground lighting in port areas provided by the various UNI standards (for example
UNI EN 12464), while the orientation was kept downwards, with a structure of protection
over each crown of headlights, fo avoid dispersion and therefore light pollution. During
routine maintenance, the correct orientation of the lamps is assessed.
