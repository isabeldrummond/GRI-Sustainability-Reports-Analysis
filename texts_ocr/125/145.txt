basis, the transition from the BS OHSAS 18001:2007 standard to the new
standard, obtaining the UN! [SO 45001:2018 certification. The transition
was completed after an in-depth analysis of the context in which the organisations
operate, which entailed the identification of internal and external factors, health and
safety requirements at work by all the parties concerned and the mapping of business
scenarios, with the attribution of risk and opportunity values for each of them, accor
ding to a defined criterion that associates the probability of occurrence with the extent
of the consequences. In particular, the suitability of the interventions implemented by
the companies to align the risks that emerged to the acceptable threshold was veri-
fied, also defining corporate objectives and improvement actions, aimed at further re-
ducing the risks and seizing new opportunities.
