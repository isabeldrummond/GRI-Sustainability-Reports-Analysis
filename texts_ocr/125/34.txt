Pursuing economic sustainability for SECH and TDT means striving to
consolidate the competitive position acquired in the upper Tyrrhenian
market, to improve process efficiency, ensuring sustainable development
not only for companies, but also for the region in which they operate.

Success in service delivery and market competitiveness translate into the
creation and fair distribution of value to the Stakeholders: for this reason,
the economic and financial results must be reassessed also by analysing
aspects, such as employee remuneration and the contributions destined
by SECH and TDT to the community.

In this sense, SECH and TDT have started all the necessary activities
to promote a culture respectful of legality and to prevent the risk of
tax defaults in any form, as well as to involve all interested parties
(Stakeholders such as consultants and institutions), so that they can
actively participate, together with the administrative function, to the
management of tax issues.

SECH and TDT are also associated with Assiterminal, the Italian Port
Terminal Association, which has the primary objective of guaranteeing
the direct representation of the associated port entrepreneurship, as well
as of contributing to the formation of policies regarding the procedures
and development of port terminal activities and, more generally, of the
national logistics system. In particular, it pursues, among its purposes, the
representation in relations with the administrative and political authorities
to protect the category interests and provides advice and information on
issues and problems of relevance for the sector.

Assiterminal has followed and managed some tax issues, such as the
ART contribution and the IMU municipal tax.

The economic effects of SECH- and TDT’s activities do not anyway end in
the production of added value: in fact, aspects such as job creation in
the reference territory - from which almost all company employees come
from - and the selection of suppliers located in the Genoa and Leghorn
contexts must be considered.
