4.2 TERMINALS’ OPERATING PROFITS

oe SECH and TDT are two terminals with different infrastructural and
operational features operating in very different geographical contexts.

ASK
. 4 For SECH, the apparent continuity of the final volumes compared to 2018

actually hides a great volatility, made of blank sailings on the Med/

Shy Middle East line, of spot vessels, especially in the second half of the year,

and services that left the terminal (e.g. MD1) on short notice.

C} The excess of terminal offers in the Genoese area, combined with
aggressive commercial policies of competitors, penalised the terminal,
Ae whose service in any case continues to be considered of excellent
wy quality, as evidenced by the high number of spot vessels calling at the

© terminal for issues generated in other structures.

During 2019, various operations were then completed, including those of
hw §=—6 the maintenance dredging in the area in front of the quay, so that the
wh 14,000-TEU vessels can therefore be operated with even greater safety. In
my | addition, at the end of the year, the construction of the new PIF (Border

Inspection Point) was completed, a cutting-edge construction for the old

Satta! port basin, which will be operational in the second half of 2020.
