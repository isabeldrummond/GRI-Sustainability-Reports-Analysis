For both terminals, the activity carried out does not give rise to significant
olfactory impacts, as they are limited to the emissions of motor vehicles
and heavy vehicles. More significant odorous emissions may instead be
due to the presence of vessels at quay and railway locomotives.

For TDT, the activities of the adjacent petrochemical centre, which affects
all the nearby residential area of Stagno mostly in windy conditions
from the ground (N-NE) or in the absence of winds, represent the most
significant source of odorous emissions in the area. The number of
sources estimated for this sector is more than 500, some with a significant
olfactory impact, others of little relevance, but an important emission
source, being close together. The petrochemical sector alone constitutes
94% of the emission sources surveyed.

In the absence of a specific national legislation and therefore of
mandatory limits to odorous emissions, the preparation of a “Monitoring
and Control Plan” was indispensable. The municipal administrations of
Leghorn and other municipalities therefore entrusted ARPAT * with the
work order and in October 2016 a monitoring plan and control of odorous
emissions for that area was presented, which set the goal of achieving the
maximum possible reduction in the levels of odorous emissions coming
from industrial and service sources, through the adoption, for many
companies in a voluntary form, of targeted and effective interventions to
achieve a positive impact on olfactory pollution.
