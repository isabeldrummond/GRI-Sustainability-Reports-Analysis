STANDARD CONTENTS AND
GRI INDICATORS

Below is the general contents index (GRI 102 - General Disclosures 2016), the details
of the indicators that express how SECH and TDT manage each material topic (GRI
103 - Management Approach 2016) and the list of published indicators relating to
each material aspect identified by the two Organisations (Topic-Specific Standards
Disclosures; GRI 200-Economic; GRI 300-Environmental; GRI 400-Social). In order to
facilitate the reading and research of the indicators of interest, the GRI code is reported
for each element, with possible identification of the area of interest (e.g. strategy and
analysis, governance, economic, environmental, etc.) and the paragraph of the report
where the connected information can be found. In addition, the symbols relating to the
specific sustainable development objectives (SDGs) discussed for each paragraph are
reported, where applicable.

With reference to the general contents, the Core/Comprehensive column highlights
the points required by the option application level.

Some contents related to the comprehensive option were not reported for 2019 (“NR"
in the table).
