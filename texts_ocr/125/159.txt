On April 28", 2019, on the occasion of World
Security Day, the two ex-aequo winners of
the competition “Ideas to promote security
at SECH” were awarded and all staff were
invited to present ideas for the benefit of the
workers’ health and safety. The company has
undertaken to carry out what is suggested,
increasing the use of the shuttle bus to offer
a service for the transfer of seafarers from on
board the vessels to the reception area and
vice versa and a dedicated service to transport workers to the allocated vehicles at
yard at the beginning of each shift. Thanks to this improvement action, the exposure
to investment risk, to which personnel passing through operating areas by foot is
extremely exposed, will be further reduced.

 

workers, the update for employees using scissor lifts, reeachstackers, industrial trucks and
felescopic-boom trucks has been planned and implemented, as well as the update
or the management of dangerous goods pursuant to the IMDG"* Code and the fire
and first-aid update for emergency workers, which from this year is completed with
he maneuvers of use of the defibrillator. Since training to SECH, however, does not
only mean fulfilling the obligation envisaged by laws and regulations, during the year
he company offered its employees the opportunity to grow and keep up to date, to
always keep their skills and competences adequate, with respect to the evolution of
he working activity. In this context falls the activity of the improvement groups, which
included a training session aimed at raising workers’ awareness of the importance of
reporting the threats they encounter in carrying out their duties, as well as creating
a network of managers who could cope with them. Among the growth patterns that
he organisation has offered to its workers, there are the courses for the qualification
io drive vehicles excluded from the State Regions Agreement (RMGs, RTGs, SSGCs), as
well as those aimed at enabling operational tasks (stevedores). These courses include
a large section on behavioural safety rules to be followed during the job and on the
main risk prevention and management measures. Dedicated extra training activity is
hen addressed to the leading roles of the security area (HSSE and employees) who,
during 2019, covered the following topics:

 

How to build safety behaviours and culture;

risk reduction at ALARP' level and health and safety performance indicators in
compliance with UNI ISO 45001;

the MSDS"¢ for dangerous substances;
guidelines for assessing the effectiveness of safety training;

workplace safety in port operations and business organization models for a
