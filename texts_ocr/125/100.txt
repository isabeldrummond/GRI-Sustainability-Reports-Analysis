The measured sound pressure levels, relevant to both day and night periods, are lower than Class VI
limits. Since these are measurement stations which are located not far from the borders, respectively
with Class IV (P1) and Class V (P2, P3), it is important to underline that the limits of the two lower
classes are also respected. The verification will be repeated in 2020 in compliance with the fouryear
periodicity, on the occasion of safety measures relating to the exposure of workers to noise.
