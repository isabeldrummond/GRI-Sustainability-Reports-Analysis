SECH and TDT establish processes to promote the communication,
participation, consultation and involvement of workers in health and
safety matters, both directly and indirectly through the company RLS; the
company communication methods take place respecting the diversity
of gender, language, culture, literacy and disability.

Through the communicative processes, organisations prescribe
appropriate behaviours in matters of health and safety towards internal
and external subjects, such as, for example: direct and indirect workers,
suppliers, contractors and visitors.

The corporate communication processes of SECH and TDT ensure that
workers acquire the necessary awareness relatively to:

Policy and objectives relevant to health and safety in the workplace;

the importance of their own contribution to the effectiveness and improvement of
the performance of the health and safety management system and the implications
and potential consequences arising from not complying with the legal and system
requirements;

the active participation of workers in the analysis of the accidents concerning them
and the results of the analysis of the relative causes; in fact, the terminals ensure
that workers at all levels are encouraged to report dangerous situations, so as to be
able to take preventive measures and take corrective actions;
