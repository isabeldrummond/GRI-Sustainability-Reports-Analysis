waste from demolition/disposal of containers damaged or seized by the Customs
along with its contents.

The waste produced by the contracted activities are not included in the waste
produced by TDT, except when abandoned, or as a result of agreements; otherwise
they remain property of the manufacturer.

For suppliers/contractors waste, since these are indirect aspects, indirect control is
envisaged through the inclusion in the contracts of environmental clauses, whose
compliance is verified with periodic audits and on-the-field inspections;

abandoned waste is collected and disposed of by TDT or internal service providers
already producing that type of waste (e.g. tyre maintenance, vehicle maintenance);

container waste damaged or seized by the Customs is not managed by TDT,
which may however be a holder and in this case requires the suppliers to have
the necessary authorisations and record the waste on its own loading/unloading
register;

waste from plant and vehicle maintenance activities is mostly borne by the subject
performing the activity, as indicated in the contracts or agreements.

Below is the annual production of waste divided by destination and hazard.
