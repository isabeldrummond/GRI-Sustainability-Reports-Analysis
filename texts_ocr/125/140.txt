As regards TDT in 2019, the training activity focused mainly on professional and/or
managerial training, on safety and security training and on operational training.

In 2019 the percentage of staff involved in the training activity was similar to that of
previous years, reaching more than two thirds of the workforce.

Confirming what happened in the recent past, also in 2019, English language courses
were provided, attended by TDT staff from various departments.

As regards safety, the usual updates were made on basic training for emergency
workers (firefighting, first aid, BLSD"') and for the maintenance and growth of the skills
for the resources assigned to the health, safety and security management system
(i.e. HSSE, RLS training). In addition, specific basic and supplementary safety training
was carried out for particular tasks (quay crane operators, RTGs operators, stevecores,
superintendents) and the new emergency staff was trained, according to the turnover
occurred. Still on the subject of safety, additional specific courses were also provided,
which are discussed in more detail in paragraph 6.6.2 “TDT approach”.

With regard to security, the familiarisation of all terminal resources in accordance with
the IMO Model Course 3.25 was completed, and the training of security for personnel
with specific security tasks, IMO Model Course 3.24, was extended, also to all emergency
personnel.

As for SECH, a potential assessment project was also activated in TDT, which involved 18
units between Senior (first levels of the organisation) and Talent (staff holding specialist
roles with high professional content), for each of which a hypothetical managerial
development plan to be implemented in the next three years is envisaged.

The professional updating activities have seen the continuation of the training of
personnel authorised to process personal data on EU regulation 2016/679 - GDPR and
the continuation of foreign language training for those who hold roles which are mostly
exposed to the use of the English language.

TDT in 2019 continued its training activities for the personnel involved in the operations;
in fact, during the year, 59 training courses were held for both internal and external
personnel, which allowed the achievement of new certificates and the updating of
already obtained qualifications. The new internal credentials concerned the operation
of quay cranes, RTGs and prime movers.
