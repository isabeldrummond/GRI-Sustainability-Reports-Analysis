n the third quarter, a reorganisation of the service linking the Mediterranean to the
Caribbean was jointly operated by CMA CGM and Marfret, extending its coverage to
he Gulf of Mexico area. This service, renamed New MedCaribe, also saw the gradual
introduction of ships with a capacity of 6,900 TEUs, replacing the previous 2,500-2,800
TEUs: an element that, added to the loss of the AL6 and Amerigo services at the end of
2018, pushed the terminal to start an important dredging work on the access channel,
whose works ended in July 2019. This is the completion of a significant project, which,
starting from the last months of the year, has allowed the terminal to fully compete on
he Mediterranean-United States trade, in which the capacity of the vessels reached
9,000 TEUs.

During the third quarter, the service connecting the Mediterranean and the west coast
of Latin America also underwent a reorganisation, as the direct service to this area was
suspended, thus affecting the volumes operated by the terminal.

 

The fourth quarter of 2019 ended on this note, which, albeit with its contradictions,
represented for TDT a year strongly characterised by significant structural investments,
in order to allow the facility to be able to guarantee a continuous future growth.
