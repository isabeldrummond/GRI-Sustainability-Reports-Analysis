The characteristics and needs of customers are surveyed through special consultation and
interview procedures (e.g. focus groups with customers and potential customers and with
commercial distribution network staff) or systematic procedures (e.g. the “Consultation
Project” customer satisfaction survey or complaints management) and through the analysis of
competitors’ products and services (benchmarking). Active participation in observatories and
working groups (e.g. through the Italian Banking Association) or research centre initiatives is
also a source of useful comparisons and information about a variety of areas and particularly
significant for those concerning the possibilities offered by new technologies.

The management of potential conflicts of interest in the provision of investment services is
regulated by a specific Group policy, adopted some time ago in compliance with the EC MiFID
Directive No. 2004/39/EC. An assessment is also made the case of UBI Comunita products
for the Third Sector involving a donation made by UBI Banca (e.g. Social Bonds, Sicavs,
Ethical Funds and Enjoy Social Edition), to check the relevant senior officers of the beneficiary
organisations in order to discover any potential conflicts of interest and activate the
procedures governed by the relevant internal regulations.

IW bank has responded to the specific characteristics of its business, which differs in some
areas from that of UBI Banca (e.g. evolved trading, an open platform for assets under
management, etc.) by setting up a specific development and management process for its
products and services, in addition to the procedure required at Group level.

Particular attention is paid to the placement of complex financial products. The Risk Appetite
Framework - Policy for trading in, the placement and subscription of financial products
establishes transparency, integrity, product quality and customer protection rules for the
provision of financial instruments. In compliance with the recommendations of the
Supervisory Authority, UBI Banca does not place products on the Consob “black list” on the
primary market (Communication No. 0097996/14), because it considers that these are not
appropriate to retail customers. These are products that, according to Consob
recommendations, may be recommended or distributed to retail customers only after an
assessment carried out by the intermediary on their appropriateness to the customer’s
interests and on the availability of sufficient information to assess the main characteristics
and the relative risks. Measures have also been taken in relation to the IW Bank online trading
platforms, to prevent customers from dealing in complex products that are in the “black list”.

Digital innovation activities to develop and expand the available range of multichannel services
continued throughout the Group in 2017. The objective is to monitor, study and build the best
services, using technology to achieve a better user experience in terms of ease-of-use and
transparency.

Protection of privacy

Technological progress and the development of procedures for acquiring and processing data
associated with the provision of services and sale of banking and other products to customers
require increasing attention to protection of personal data, in order to ensure that private
individuals are aware, well-informed and protected with regard to the use of their personal
