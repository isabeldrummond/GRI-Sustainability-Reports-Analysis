productive requirements and personal, family and working time for employees, using flexible
arrangements such as part-time, reduced or suspended working arrangements, time banking
and smart working. With particular reference to the reduction or suspension of working hours
with the objective of combining the requirements to curb staff costs and meet the needs of
family and personal life, an agreement was reached with trade unions to allow recourse to
partially paid “voluntary leave”, which resulted in around 140,000 days of leave been taken
during the course of the whole of 2017.

In particular, smart working, used by approximately 300 persons, represents an innovative
labour solution that promotes the reconciliation of private and professional dimensions along
with productivity and environmental sustainability.

With reference to part-time contracts, requests, durations and returning from
maternity/pregnancy/postpartum leave and organisational mobility are covered definitively at
the regulatory level. More specifically, priority is given to substantiated requests and, in
particular, to those justified by the need to care for children or other minors in legal custody
(within the age limits of the elementary school certificate) or when the applicants provide
serious family and/or health reasons involving the health of the applicant, spouse, family
members of the first degree, cohabitants and persons in legal custody.

Where work suspension for maternity/paternity is concerned, measures have been introduced
to protect organizational mobility for workers and flexible hours compatible with the
requirements of their jobs.

In 2017 approximately 7,000 employees (54.8% women) took leave for maternity reasons and
to care for their children, for study or other personal needs.

Particular attention has been devoted to the situations of employees directly or indirectly in
disability circumstances, by introducing an experimental supplementary allowance in addition
to the paid leave provided under Law No. 104. In addition, staff members certified to have
disabilities of more than 70% are eligible for a corporate contribution in addition to their
supplementary coverage.

Since 2002, households of active and retired employees who have disabled
children who are not self-sufficient may be eligible for support from the
Clematis Onlus Association (www.clematisonlus.org), established on the
initiative of a group of employees and supported financially by the Group.
The Association executed an insurance arrangement to cover disabled
children in case of the death of both parents with a comprehensive income
of €12,000 per annum subject to revaluation and providing families with
"rehabilitative training" and assistance allowances. 70 households have subscribed to the
insurance arrangement, including 35 families of retired staff members, benefiting 73 disabled
children.
