Last, to improve the skills and knowledge of operators in the non-profit sector, during the
latter half of the year, UBI Comunita promoted the organization of a number of local
arrangements designed to enhance the most significant new features introduced under the
Third Sector Reform, considering that the benefits of the reform may also lead to growth and
development in the non-profit sector and in Italy's system in general.

Project finance for infrastructures

UBI Banca's Corporate & Investment Banking Division, which operates in the Investment
Banking instruments and services and Large Corporate Customer Management sectors,
through specialised Structured Finance units, contributes to support infrastructure
investments in Italy, a vitally important sector in the development and growth of the local
economic and social fabric, assessing the key projects submitted in both the public and
private sectors of renewable energy, transportation (roads, metropolitan railways and
airports), services (water and gas networks) and health (hospitals).

During 2017, UBI Banca's presence was particularly important in initiatives for the
restructuring of existing financing and in support of the investment plans for a number of
major airport infrastructures. UBI Banca has participated in financing from SAVE, which
manages a number of airports in Northern Italy and in the financing of 21 Aeroporti SpAs and
the subsidiary Gesac, which manages the Naples Capodichino Station, the first investment in
the sector by F2i, which is the largest Italian infrastructure fund (the shareholders include
Cassa Depositi e Prestiti—CDP), Intesa Sanpaolo and Unicredit Group).
