Creation of value

The creation of economic value that is sustainable over time is the Group's principal objective
as an essential condition for remunerating shareholders and employees and for maintaining an
adequate level of capitalization to support credit activities through allocations to reserves.

This objective is supported by all units of the Group through the establishment of the Business
Plan and the relevant project plan, which is known as the Transformation Plan. Progress in
connection with this Plan is systematically monitored by the UBI Banca Management
Committee in dedicated sessions, so that any remedial measures that may be required can be
adopted in a timely manner. During 2017, in connection with the Business Plan,
rationalisation projects were pursued for the Group,! the distribution network? and the work
force® through improved efficiency, cost containment and projects for innovation* in processes,
products and services to make the Group more competitive on the market in terms of quality
and convenience.

The Regulation on the performance measurement system and the Methodological performance
measurement manual ensure that a uniform, consistent approach is used in obtaining
information and stating results.

Economic value generated and distributed [GRI 201-1 201-3:4 202-1 204-1]

The reclassification of the consolidated income statement highlights the economic value
generated by the Group, which is substantially reflected in the prices customers pay for the
products and services it provides, net of any losses and impairement losses on loans. In
keeping with UBI Banca's retail banking focus, the share of financial assets is in fact limited.

In the area of climate change, which has taken on a preponderant role in assessing the
sustainability of human, social and economic activity, the Group has no direct exposure to
risks correlated with climate change potentially having substantial impacts on the creation of
value.

Processes in connection with purchasing (more specifically in connection with fuel and
electricity costs) and business and credit (related to extreme weather events that might affect
the operational capacities of business customers) may be impacted to a lesser extent, although
these risks would be mitigated by the high level of diversification in lending sectors).

On the other hand, business opportunities may arise in promoting investments by individuals
and businesses in ways to save energy, the use of alternative energies, and investments by
businesses to adapt to changing regulations and efficiency standards for products and
production processes.
