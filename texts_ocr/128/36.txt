stakeholders to identify their expectations in connection with the Group's activities. In drafting
the Code of Ethics, UBI Banca has identified the major categories of stakeholders: customers,
staff, investors, suppliers, communities (with particular reference to local communities), public
authorities, operators on the financial market, the media and opinion leaders and
organizations representing stakeholders' interests.

Shareholders’ Meetings held as provided in the Articles of Association, at least on an annual
basis in connection with the publication of the financial statements, and meetings in the field
with senior management in connection with significant events in the life of the Bank, such as
the development and implementation of the Single Bank Project in 2017), operators on the
financial market and the media (through investor and media relations activities, on an
intensified basis in connection with important dates on the financial calendar), employees

well-being), and customers (through customer satisfaction surveys conducted systematically
during the year).
