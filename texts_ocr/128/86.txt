placing the UBI Pramerica Bilanciato Etico fund : a new fund investing in financial
instruments that are mainly denominated in euros and listed on regulated markets in the euro
area and meet ethical and social responsibility requirements.

The new fund, with a total of €218 million placed within a time frame (October/November
2017), aims to broaden the range of ethical funds offered by the Group's asset management
company UBI Pramerica in order to highlight the growing propensity and need for investors,
including private individuals, to combine the traditional objective of financial returns with
ethical and social principles when making their investment choices. In this way the UBI
Pramerica Bilanciato Etico fund, categorised as a balanced bond product, is a combination of
the typical exclusion criteria of the main socially responsible investments (SRIs). The fund
aims at a balanced portfolio, investing mainly in bond-type and monetary financial
instruments most of which are issued by companies with investment grade credit assets and
up to a maximum of 30% in equity instruments and other securities that represent risk
capital.

All the instruments are mainly denominated in euros and listed on regulated markets in the
euro area and meet ethical and social responsibility requirements.

An additional feature of the fund is the commitment made by UBI and the Group’s asset
management company to support nonprofit and social purpose organisations, by means of a
one-off donation by UBI Banca of 4% of the placement commissions at the end of the
placement period and a donation by the asset management company of 4% of the recurring
management fees.

A donation of 4% of the placement commissions and 4% of the management fees from the
launch (November 2017) until 31s‘ December 2018, will be made to support the CasAmica
Onlus : “Always closer to patients away from home and their relatives: CasAmica opens new
doors of welcome in Rome and Lecco”. The project is designed to support the opening of two
new houses in Rome and Lecco, to accommodate patients and their relatives who travel to
hospitals that are far from home, enabling them to stay in a family environment while they are
ill; more specifically 2,000 more patients and their relatives in addition to the 4,000 a year
hosted by CasAmica at its houses in Milan. More specifically, UBI Banca will grant a total
donation amounting to €200 thousand against the placement of this fund, of which €140
thousand in the current year.

During 2017, UBI Banca has also donated €159 thousand attributable to previous
placements; to UNICEF for the Sicav Social 4 Future Class A fund and the Astalli Centre
Association for the Sicav Social 4 Future Class 1 fund.

In addition to the UBI Sicav Social 4 Future fund (launched in 2016) and the UBI Pramerica
Bilanciato Etico fund (launched in 2017), UBI Pramerica offers two further Italian-registered
products: the UBI Pramerica Azionario Etico fund (launched in 2005) and the UBI Pramerica
Obbligazionario Euro Corporate Etico fund (launched in 2015), which donate 5% of the
management commission received each year. The 2017 beneficiary is FAI - the National Trust
for Italy.
