The corporate Intranet - UBI Digital Workspace - includes a maintained and updated section
devoted to health and safety, in which legal and corporate references are readily available
along with news on the Group's safety scheme (such as contingency plans and escape routes
to be followed in the various areas with real photographic images), didactic material used in
the classroom during training initiatives, advice and useful information on proper lifestyles to
maintain an effective psycho-physical balance.

In addition to the monitoring activities directly carried out on site by the Prevention and
Protection Service, there are plans within the framework of the SGSL processes to conduct ad
hoc, in-depth monitoring activities of the processes incumbent on the delegated units,
conducted through interviews with staff at various levels of responsibility, in connection with
the implementation of the law, the practical implementation of the delegated responsibilities,
and through the examination of the legal texts. These monitoring activities are extended,
under the most significant arrangements, to suppliers on their premises, through an
independent external auditor from a leading consulting firm.

As provided by the management system protocols, all activities are reported and recorded and
are subject to specific review meetings with the employers, so that the objectives achieved can
be reviewed and future goals defined. In light of the role of "compliance specialist” attributed to
UBI Banca's occupational prevention and protection function, there are also periodic
information flows on compliance in connection with the central compliance unit and to the
collegial bodies.

Occupational accidents and illnesses

In the examination of accidents, we do not observe any categories of workers that are more
vulnerable than others to the risks of being involved in occupational accidents.

The largest percentage of accidents in 2017 as well continues to be events occurring when
employees are traveling between home and work, which are risks to which all employees are
exposed.’ Accidents that have occurred while on the job are also quite limited, despite the
significant number of personnel who use service cars on a daily basis in the course of their
professional activities and the total number of kilometres travelled.

With regard to the risk of being subjected to psycho-physical damage as a result of robberies
or being involved in aggression on the part of the customers, four events occurred during
2017, equivalent to 5.6% of the accidents occurring in the workplace and 1.6% of the total
injuries reported.

In addition, in 2017, there were no fatal accidents either at work or while commuting.

2 The INAIL has recently decided to include events as commuting accidents events that in previous years
were not considered, such as alternative routes to work to take children to school.
