In the preparation of corporate welfare plans, UBI Banca aims to harmonize at the group level
the various forms of supplementary pension and assistance benefits and existing staff
insurance policies so that adequate levels of benefits are provided in the different companies of
the Group.

In support of younger colleagues as they enter the work force, regulations were introduced to
enhance the corporate contribution to supplementary pension schemes and _first-home-
purchase incentives. Additional welfare benefits are supported through the reimbursement of
certain incurred household expenses (e.g. schools of all types and at all levels, campus
expenses, textbooks, canteen services and care for elderly family members) or through
education/recreation and sports services provided by the Bank.
