Increases in energy consumption are mainly due to heating and are caused partly by a winter
that was colder than the previous one and above all by the extension of the area reported on to
include the New Banks. These banks operate in areas where there is a greater dependence on
heating systems that use fossil fuels.

Emissions |

The emissions produced by the Group mainly relate to greenhouse gases and the other
pollutants produced by the use of energy from fossil fuels, whereas emissions of ozone-
depleting gases were not found to be significant.

Emissions are monitored using the annual reporting cycle of the Sustainability Report and
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

A major contribution to the overall reduction of emissions is also made by reducing the
amount of commuting to and from work and the increasing use of sustainable transport. This
reduction in mobility is influenced by smart working (from home or the nearest Group office),
which started in 2015 and has significantly increased in 2017 with 4,560 days worked, saving
an average of approximately 428,502 kilometres and avoiding the emission of at least 66,047
tons of CO2. Another contribution to more sustainable mobility is made by providing sheltered
bicycle parking at some of the Bank’s main premises and a coach shuttle service running
between our Bergamo, Varese, Brescia and Milan offices (and also around the city of Milan).
The shuttle coaches transported an average of 310 passengers per day in 2017 which
prevented at least 1,000 tons of COz2 emissions compared with the use of cars.
