The Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi manages the purchasing cycle for Group
companies in compliance with the provisions of the Group Spending Regulations. These
regulations, which apply to all Group companies, govern the roles and responsibilities of those
involved in managing budgets and incurring expenses with the separation of roles between
those requesting supplies and authorising payments, those that sign contracts and handle
negotiations with suppliers and those keeping the accounts and paying the invoices.

During 2017, the new UBI.S supplier portal was launched, with which the Group's regular and
occasional suppliers of goods and services exceeding €30,000 can register.’ Each supplier
must declare its adherence to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and indicate
whether they have qualifications such as quality certifications (ISO 9001 or equivalent), Social
Accountability certifications (SA8000 or equivalent), Occupational Health and Safety
Assessment Series (OHSAS 18001), environmental management certificate (ISO 14001 or
equivalent), Eco Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) registration, and registration in the
Environmental Management Register.

At the end of 2017, 1,033 suppliers were listed in the Register (an increase of 18% compared
with 2016, as a result of 173 newly-registered suppliers and 16 that were removed from the
Register)®.

For each category of goods, the Register lists the preferred suppliers with input from the offices
requesting the supplies and the Purchasing Department. Each supplier is given a global score,
50 percent of which reflects the input score (which in turn is determined 60% by economic
and capital soundness from external databases and 40% from having certifications and overall
turnover); the remaining 50% of the score is obtained through periodic performance
assessments (which in turn are determined 60% by fiscal responsibility assessment data and
40% percent by competitiveness assessments conducted by the Purchasing Department).

The Group’s Code of Ethics has a specific section on relations with suppliers which must be
oriented towards mutual satisfaction and be based on the observance of the principles of
transparency, fairness, loyalty, integrity and competition?.

Contractual conditions and payment terms are aligned on an ongoing basis with the legislation
in force and with market conditions on the basis of periodic monitoring. Specific contractual
clauses are included for recurrent, strategic, high-operational-risk and financially substantial
supplies.

Standard contractual clauses empower UBI Sistemi e Servizi to verify or have verified by its
agents that the supply of goods or the provision of services is carried out, in compliance with
the applicable legislation and regulations. Such clauses also provide for the supplier to
undertake to facilitate the implementation of these verification powers, by providing UBI
Sistemi e Servizi with all the information required, including the documentation needed to
carry out appropriate controls.
