bank, generating positive impacts, through support for efficient management of services
carried out by general government targeting the socioeconomic fabric.

Local presence [FS7]

The commitment to the local economy presumes the knowledge of the local economic realities
that can only be gained through local presence. This factor is reflected in the features of the
Group’s commercial network, which is present in small centres,! in the organisation of the
distribution of branches into Macro Territorial Areas, and in the decentralised levels
responsible for lending.?

Indirect economic impacts [GRI 203-1:2 FS7]

In connection with the value of local presence, business and credit policies must be applied to
meet the real requirements of local economic transactors, and specifically small economic
activities and small and medium-sized enterprises with the objective of promoting and
sustaining the development of a sound economic and entrepreneurial fabric capable of
generating economic and social value in the medium and long term.

The transposition of Ministerial Decree No. 57/2014, which introduces the Legality Rating for
enterprises, is part of this context, in light of the need to address corruption and other illegal
activities. This text requires banks to take these ratings into account in order to reduce the
time and costs involved in assessments, in determining the enterprise’s creditworthiness and
relevant economic conditions for access to credit, when relevant in the credit reporting
process. The rating is valid for two years and may be renewed on request by the enterprise
involved. Ratings may range from a minimum of “one star” to a maximum of “three stars” on
the basis of the requirements the enterprise meets. UBI Banca has introduced specific rules
for considering Legality Ratings in regulating the processing and approval of credit lines.
Depending on the time required in the process, the data on the business volume for agencies
that have a Legality Rating will be published, as soon as they become available, in the Social
Responsibility section of the Group's corporate website pursuant to the requirements under
the regulatory texts governing transparency.

Finance for development

UBI Banca invests €97.2 billion, which directly exceeds direct funding by euro 2.8 billion. The
additional funding needed was acquired as a result of the Group’s ability to tap the financial
market and public-sector funds, some of which on concessional terms, specifically targeting
small and medium-size enterprises..

The Consolidated management report reflects all of the Group's commercial activities with
enterprises, reflecting the dynamics of the different economic sectors, in support of those in
which the outlook is more favourable for growth and innovation. This is true for: (i) the Farm
& Food activities in the agriculture and agro-food sector, which contribute substantially to the
country's GDP through increasing world interest in "Made in Italy" brands, (ii) the UBI World
programme to support Italian enterprises on foreign markets with the required financial
assistance and support services for the international expansion of their activities and (iii)
leveraged financing operations in the framework of Corporate & Investment Banking for
special operations in connection with business ownership to support growth processes and
assist in managing discontinuity issues.
