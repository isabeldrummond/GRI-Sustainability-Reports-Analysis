2 This form, which accompanies transported waste, is a compulsory waste identification document,
which must be drawn up in four copies, filled in, dated and signed by the producer or by the holder of
the waste and countersigned by the shipper. One copy of the accompaniment form remains with the
producer or holder, while the other three, countersigned and dated on arrival at the recipient consist of
one acquired by the recipient and two by the shipper, who sends one to the holder/producer. The
receipt of the fourth copy of the accompaniment form by the producer/holder is necessary for the
release of that party from responsibility for the proper disposal or recovery of the waste. The copies of
the accompaniment form must be kept for five years.
