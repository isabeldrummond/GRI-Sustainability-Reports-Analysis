Dialogue with trade unions

The scenario in Italy is one of a high level of attention toward workers which UBI Banca
considers its commitment to maintain both on a daily basis and with regard to the
management of large organisational changes; it is a commitment which goes beyond mere
compliance with regulations. The quality of trade union relations in fact makes it possible to
maintain a positive business environment and to find adequate solutions to meet demands for
optimised, flexible labour, that are and will continue in the near future to be key driving
factors in meeting the Group's objectives of efficiency and profitability.

The Human Resources Area, which reports to the Chief Operating Officer, is responsible for
negotiations between management and labour. It has been UBI Banca's longstanding practice
to use a policy of cooperation, while observing the respective roles of each party, to find
mutually beneficial solutions whenever possible through a transparent, practical, and ongoing
dialogue, going beyond the minimum requirements provided under the _ institutional
procedures. Policies and measures to protect workers from the social and occupational
repercussions of company reorganizations are central issues in this connection. Professional
retraining and mobility processes are used to optimise human and professional resources and
assist in proposing specific training and mobility plans, while staff downsizing plans rely on a
voluntary approach through redundancy incentive programmes and recourse to the income
support “solidarity fund” for the sector.

Freedom of association and collective bargaining [GRI 102-41 407-1]

All of the banks' staff (including personnel from the three new banks acquired in 2017) and
other companies with registered offices in Italy (more than 99% of the Group's total workforce)
are covered under national collective bargaining agreements and are not subject to any
restrictions to the freedom of association and participation in trade unions.

There are six trade union organizations in the Group, to which 82% of the staff belong. All
Trade Union Organizations operate freely within their own prerogatives, and the Group makes
adequate operational means available to them to conduct trade union activities. Trade union
representatives used approximately 247 thousand hours of trade union leave, in the exercise
of their relative trade union rights.
