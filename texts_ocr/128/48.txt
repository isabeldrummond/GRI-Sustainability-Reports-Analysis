To support the spread and strengthening of social entrepreneurship through credit
instruments, in 2012-with the issue of a dedicated Social bond-UBI Banca launched
collaboration with CGM and CGM Finance to promote and accelerate mechanisms of social
innovation and economically sustainable growth of social cooperatives and consortiums in
connection with banking instruments and services under concessional conditions; at end-
2017, 27 loans were granted in a total amount of more than €6 million.

For that purpose, during the fourth quarter of 2017, UBI Banca was the first banking
institution to join the ABI-CDP Convention of the Ministry of Economic Development? of 8thy
July 2018 on the Revolving fund to support enterprises operating in social economic sectors.
At the end of the year, the Bank obtained a new €50 million Social Activities MBIL financing
facility from the European Investment Bank (EIB).5 The signing of the Convention with the
MISE was made possible with a combination of the expertise of the Concessional Financing
Unit, enabling the immediate transfer of established experience in other areas of UBI
Communita in terms of internal measurements techniques and instruments to assess
creditworthiness. In this context, social impact assessment (for which UBI Banca applies the
social return on investment—SROI methodology to projects in connection with Social Bonds)
becomes particularly relevant, as a proxy for value of social enterprises, and as a fundamental
element to define their eligibility for access to concessional financing that banks are required
to verify and measure.

UBI Banca has developed a specialised methodology for assessing creditworthiness, so that
the specialised features of various third sector entities (ETS) can be most effectively
understood and assessed, through the acquisition of qualitative and quantitative information
useful in expanding the social nature and impact of their activities (intangible assets). During
2017, in connection with operators in the sector, the Reporting form for third sector entities
and the Detailed information form on loan applications from third-sector entities were updated
and implemented. These two instruments support the commercial network and provide
feedback on internal assessments of business opportunities and evidence on creditworthiness
and financial and economic sustainability, that can also be used to define conditions to be
applied to financing, potentially with an “incentive” approach depending on the levels of
autonomy defined in the business policies.

In banking services, during 2017, the marketing was launched for new Non-profit enterprise
formula packages dedicated to third sector entities, divided into four lines with increasing fees
and diversified services to reflect the size and various operational requirements of individual
third sector entities. The new approach is designed to simplify the contractual, procedural
and commercial proposal process by providing for each package a set number of products
selected to meet the different levels of complexity in the customer’s requirements.

In support of the funding requirements for non-profit organizations, UBI Banca has developed
innovative investment instruments such as Social Bonds and Open-end investment company
(SICAV)/UBI Pramerica Ethical Funds (see section on Commitment to the Community) and
initiatives to involve employees and customers in dedicated instruments such as the
Solidarity credit, UBI Pay and Payroll Giving.®

4 The Convention establishes the terms and mechanisms for submitting concessional financing
applications provided under the Decree of 3rd July 2015 of the Minister of Economic Development on
granting of concessional financing (70% at the concessional rate of 0.50% with CDP funds and 30% at
market rates with bank funds) designed strictly for social enterprises, social cooperatives, and related
consortiums, with total funding of €200 million from the Revolving fund to support enterprises and
investments in research (FRI) managed by the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. The Convention is applicable
only to credit institutions meeting specific requirements in terms of the adoption of specific valuation
methodologies and/or the volume of financing granted to the target in reference.

5 Medium and long-term financing under advantageous conditions with terms of up to 20 years
supported with concessional funding of investments with social implications developed by public,
private and private social entities. The formal establishment and start-up of the facility is planned
during the first quarter of 2018.

6 The Solidarity credit enables clients having Qui UBI and Qui UBI Affari services to send transfers to
third sector entities free of charge; UBI Pay is an application that makes it possible to send money free
