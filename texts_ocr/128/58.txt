In accordance with Article 35 of Legislative Decree No. 81/2008, all companies have provisions
for periodic meetings between company representatives (the Employer and_ its
representatives), the manager and agents of the Prevention and Protection Service, the
competent physician, and the Labour Representatives for Safety, when applicable. The Head
of the Prevention and Protection Service is also periodically called to meet with the 231
Supervisory Bodies and participates in the activities of Health and Safety Working Group
established within the framework of the Trade Union and Labour Directorate of the Italian
Banking Association (ABI).

All activities carried out have the twofold objectives of ensuring the regulatory compliance
while reducing operational risks, reflecting cost savings deriving from the reduction in
accidents and the lower insurance rates that the INAIL grants to companies providing evidence
that they have adopted proper prevention and protection practices for occupational risks.

First, prevention is guaranteed through ongoing adequacy checks of the workplaces and
equipment, carried out periodically by personnel of the Prevention and Protection Service,
through inspections of the various operating units throughout the country. More specifically, a
checklist is used to identify the operational priorities based on “magnitude of risk” ratings
assigned to individual situations of noncompliance identified during the inspections.

For the New Banks, prior to the finalization of their acquisition, the Labour Prevention and
Protection function was subjected to off-site supervision to ensure that the essential
compliance requirements were present in the area of prevention, notwithstanding the
maintenance within each legal entity of responsibilities incumbent on the parties provided in
each case by the preventative legislation (employers, any agents they may have, heads of
prevention and protection units, and the competent physician). Following the formal
integration of these banks, the management model in force with the UBI Group was extended
to all of the operational units acquired. The alignment of information on the effective level of
workplace compliance is ensured by a special on-site monitoring activity carried out by a
specific task force coordinated by UBI's Labour Prevention and Protection function, which will
prepare a report to be submitted to the employer with a view to the adoption of a specific
improvement plan.

Given the importance in terms of prevention that the activities of the external suppliers
(installation and maintenance workers), the relevant technical specifications have also been
fine-tuned and the relevant contractors are required to provide more detailed documentation
on the compliance of their activities and to adapt their IT procedures already available to staff
of the Group so that any new risks and/or malfunctions can be reported. Projects to build new
premises or to refurbish existing premises involve prior examination of documents by the
Prevention and Protection Service, which programmed on-site conformity inspections on
completion of the works and the entry into service of the premises.

The employers of the Group companies, based on the evidence collected by the Prevention and
Protection Service inherent in both the conditions of the workplace and health and safety
training requirements, will prepare an Operational improvement plan to be submitted to the
corporate entities directly involved in its practical implementation, for which periodic, formal
reporting is requested.

From the more specific viewpoint of health, the activities of corporate physicians provide
continuous monitoring of the state of health of personnel and the healthiness of working
environments both by means of the annual plan of periodic checkups for staff (compulsory
health screening by law) and by on-site inspections of working environments. Staff may also
report specific problems to the corporate physician by means of a dedicated and confidential
email address.

Other important aspects include work-related stress assessment, conducted and monitored,
amongst other things, by means of the subjective perceptions of employees by means of
special questionnaires and the management of the impacts of criminal events to which
distribution network staff in particular are exposed. The progressive emergence of a new type
of aggression, mainly verbal, but also physical perpetrated by customers as a consequence of a
deterioration in their socio-economic conditions and connected with more rigid rules for
granting credit has resulted in the extension of psychological assistance to include these
situations as well.
