The geographic distribution of funding and lending shows a preponderance of Northern Italy,
and more specifically Lombardy, as the group's main market.!!.

The distribution of lending is consistent with the Group's mission to support local economies:
more than half of the Group's business involves production companies in a wide range of
economic sectors, and primarily manufacturing, property, trade, and construction activities.
The Group's customers are predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises, which in total
account for 3/4 of the lending to businesses.

The distribution network is based on seven Macro Geographical areas (MATs) and includes the
Bank's online banking and product company brands. IT activities and other support functions
are managed by UBI Sistemi e Servizi, while training and professional and managerial
development activities are carried out by UBI Academy.
