transport emission factors

Calculation method

Paper: consumption is multiplied by the underlying CEPI emissions coefficient which refers solely to emissions
generated for the production of pulp, paper and cardboard in firms/paper mills. The Confederation of European
Paper Industries (CEPI) is a nonprofit organisation which represents approximately 495 companies that
produce pulp, paper and cardboard and 900 paper mills for an overall total that accounts for approximately
22% of world production.

Business travel: emissions of the company car fleet already reported under indicator 305-1 are excluded. The
kilometres travelled by air were retrieved from the IATA certified management app provided by the travel
agency. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is a trade association to which airlines from all over
the world belong and it represents approximately 280 airlines, i.e. 83% of total air traffic. On the basis of the
method provided by the Italian Banking Association, the kilometres travelled for domestic, international and
intercontinental trips were multiplied by the respective emissions coefficients calculated as the weighted
average of the main routes (in terms of the number of trips and distances), using the ICAO Carbon Emissions
Calculator app. The kilometres travelled by train were retrieved from the management app provided by the
travel agency. On the basis of the method provided by the Italian Banking Association, the kilometres travelled
by train were multiplied by the respective emissions coefficients calculated as the weighted average of the
main routes (number of trips and distances) using the app Ecopassenger. The kilometres travelled by
employees in their own petrol or diesel powered cars have been multiplying by the underlying emissions
coefficients.

Shuttle coach: the tons of gas oil have been multiplied by the emissions factors taken from the ISPRA
database of average road transport emission factors. CO2 equivalent emissions include CO2, CH4 and N2O and

have been calculated using the IPCC 100 year GWPs for CH, (28) and N20 (265).

 

GHG EMISSIONS INTENSITY ]

Calculation method

Total emissions do not include Scope 3 emissions (305-3) and include scope 1 emissions (305-1) and the
residual emissions of the scope 2 (305-2) not covered by GO certificates. Total emissions were divided by
the number of employees and associate workers (21,495 amounting to 100% of the Group total) and by
the net internal floor area of the properties (1,267.931 sq m) of the Group companies within the relative
scope.
