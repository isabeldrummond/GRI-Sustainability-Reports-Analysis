Respect for customers

The changing competitive environment that banks must address through digital
transformation and the consequent changes in customer behaviour and expectations are of
growing strategic significance.

The primary objective is now to attract and retain customers better than the competition and
to do this we need to adopt a competitive strategy that can create and reinforce bonds of trust.
From this point of view customer satisfaction with quality and the cost of the product or
service provided are not the only factors affecting customer loyalty. Of equal importance are
customer expectations relating to the intangible aspects of the relationship, including the
perception of the transparency of contractual conditions, security and privacy in relationship
management and the solutions provided for problems and emergencies. This is gaining further
significance due to the establishment of a service model centred on a variety of digital
channels that does not offer the same reassurance of direct personal contact and is
increasingly tied to technologies that increase internet data flow and the security problems
associated with it.

It is also the opinion of the Bank of Italy that the quality of relationships between banks and
their customers is a key strategic factor for the competitiveness and soundness of
intermediaries and that good rules, effective self-regulation and correct behaviour are the
cornerstones of customer protection.

UBI Banca shares this vision and evaluates respect for customers from the viewpoints of
security (in terms of business continuity, IT systems and physical security in branches);
uniformity of products and services (in the sense of providing customers with transparent
information); marketing communications (above all in terms of the proposals being appropriate
to customer needs and profiles and the appropriateness of the promotional communications
and the commercial contact), respect for privacy and, more generally, compliance with
legislation and regulations — including voluntary codes of conduct —- that govern the sale and
use of products and services.

In the Italian context, all these aspects are governed by specific legislation and regulations for
the sector, that the Group incorporates into its internal regulations that it distributes to all
employees on the corporate internet and covered on specific refresher courses. In particular,
the Group has adopted an Internal policy for managing inducements!, Guidelines on
commercial practices aimed at consumers?, a Regulation implementing Bank of Italy
provisions on the transparency of banking and financial operations and services, a Policy for

1 The policy incorporates criteria to implement the obligation to act in the best interests of the customer
and ensure that commercial information is correct and transparent.

2 The guidelines are intended to state behaviour relating to commercial practices more clearly, in
compliance with the provisions of the Code of Conduct, providing relevant information about operating
in compliance with the provisions of Title III of the Consumer Code.

3 This regulation implements Bank of Italy provisions which assume business relationships based on
good faith and integrity and are intended to improve the effectiveness of transparency tools, regulate
the behaviour of intermediaries in order to promote more considered customer choices in line with their
financial requirements and make it easier to compare offers and promote competition in the market.
