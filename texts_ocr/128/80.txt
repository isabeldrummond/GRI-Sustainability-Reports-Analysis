deafblind people), and FOCSIV (international Christian voluntary work organisation), to
support the following initiatives: La Gardenia di AISM, #Timeout: Let’s end violence against
women, Cross the threshold, Close to those who cannot see or hear, Always closer to
patients away from home and their families and We smiled for something serious, by
making numerous fundraising instruments and channels available and increasing
awareness among the Group's customers and employees;

e Accenture Foundation and Bracco Foundation for the second Welfare what a business!
competition aimed at social start-ups in the community welfare field, which has involved
new partners this year: Golinelli Foundation and Snam Foundation as promoters, Polimi
Hub, Socialfare and Campania Newsteel as enterprise incubators or accelerators and Milan
Polytechnic and Aiccon as scientific partners;

e Anffas Onlus (national association for families of persons with mental and/or relational
difficulties) and the GCM Co-operative Group with which UBI Banca, co-operation with its
trust company UBI Trustee promoted the Trust in Life project. The project provides
services and financial support for people with severe disabilities and their families, using
the legal instrument of a trust as a multi-beneficiary mutual tool to manage all the
financial resources associated with the Life Project personalised support programme. This
project is also intended to organise interventions to support the social inclusion of people
with severe disabilities, by activating local networks and the specific expertise of partners,
with an approach that is open to all those in the area with an interest in working together
to share experiences and skills. To that end, meetings involving the key public and private
stakeholders were held in local communities in 2017 to present and investigate the content
of the legislation and the project. In 2018 it will continue to organise information events in
local communities and launch a completion to bring together initiatives and best practice
selected by operators belonging to the Anffas and GCM network in accordance with the
“After Us” law (Law No. 112/2016). The projects selected will be supported by UBI Banca,
which will forgo part of its income from the new Hybrid credit card.

Investment products play an important role in supporting social projects that create value for
the community: UBI Comunita Social Bonds, Sicavs and Ethical funds with a donation of part
of the income. Social Bonds are bond instruments which, in addition to providing
remuneration at a market interest rate for the investment made by subscribers, allocate part
of the funding acquired (normally 0.50%) to support projects of high social value undertaken
by nonprofit organisations, or use it for form a pool for the disbursement of finance to third
sector initiatives. Again in 2017, UBI Banca was the confirmed sector leader, in terms of both
volumes and impact generated, placing six new bonds amounting to a total of €95 million,
which resulted in donations totalling €355 thousand, in addition to a further €203 thousand
donated for two social bonds placed in 2015 and 2016 (for the Progetto Arca Foundation and
the Confederation of the Misericordie d7talia voluntary associations). From its launch in 2012
to the end of 2017, the Group has placed 88 social bonds, collecting approximately €973
million, and resulting in charitable donations of over €4.6 million and in approximately 20.5
million in available loan pools or loans granted.

In order to allocate resources more effectively and efficiently to the initiatives that have the
greatest impact on change and increase accountability to customers who subscribe bonds and
to Group stakeholders more generally, as part of the structuring process for social bonds and
the upfront placement of Sicavs or ethical funds, UBI Banca measures the social impact to
evaluate the projects to be supported. The tool used is Social Return on Investment (SROJ),
which converts an estimate of the expected social impacts of the project into monetary terms
(ex ante valuation) and the impacts achieved on its completion (ex post valuation). An outside
independent company with professionals of high standing assists UBI Banca with the
application of SROI. It verifies the compliance of the methodology used for data collection and
the relative sources, the monetisation of the expected and achieved impacts of the project and
the calculation of social value and verification of the underlying assumptions, as well as
checking that the results of the project are consistent with its aims. Normally, 30% of the
donation is disbursed on completion of a project, once it has passed the independent ex post
check and has been found to have met expectations and complied with social and
environmental requirements.
