SROI was applied ex ante to the three projects shown in the following table in 2017, with very
positive results in terms of the expected social impact. Only the ex post SROI calculation will
be performed for the Lega del Filo d’Oro “Close to those who cannot see or hear” project
(approximately 2,000 disabled beneficiaries), while the Impact Factor tool will be used for the
AIRC “My First AIRC Grant” project (scholarships awarded to 22 researchers).

In the commercial area, the UBI Comunita Social Edition initiative continued. This involves
the issue of an Enjoy UBI Comunita prepaid card, customised with the logo of the nonprofit
organisations for which they are issued. UBI Banca waives its right to part of the commission
on these cards and donates it to the nonprofit organisation. Customised cards for six
organisations were issued in 2017, including AIDO Lombardia and AIRC, for a total of around
13 cards, of which approximately 10,000 are active, generating a donation of approximately
€21 thousand. As part of the partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA),
which involves the marketing of the prepaid Enjoy NBA card, UBI Banca has decided to donate
five euros to FIPIC (the Italian Wheelchair Basketball Federation) for each card issued to a
Group employee (approximately €1,300 in 2017).

 

Also in the commercial area, €2.3 million were donated to local authorities as part of treasury
and collection services, to support the achievement of their social aims.

Actions taken by the Foundations

Over the years the Group has formed a series of foundations and acquired others as part of
merger projects, which act autonomously in their own local communities, in compliance with
the provisions of the respective Articles of Association. The most significant initiatives in 2017
are:

e for the Banca Popolare Bergamo Foundation, a donation to the Bergamo in History Onlus
Foundation museum on the occasion of its 100" anniversary, the purchase of a Gran Coda
piano for the students of the Gaetano Donizetti Conservatoire in Bergamo, support over
two years for the activities of the Bergamo Modern and Contemporary Art Gallery (GAMeC)
and support for the Intercultura Onlus Foundation for a competition to fund students for a
period of study abroad;

e for the Banca San Paolo di Brescia Foundation support to carry out the activities of the
Opera per l’Educazione Cristiana (more specifically for scientific research purposes, a
donation to the Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore for improvements to physics
laboratories and actions to benefit students with disabilities), a payment to the Diocese of
Brescia Pastoral Office of the Brescia Caritas for running the Madre Eugenia Menni
community canteen for the needy;
