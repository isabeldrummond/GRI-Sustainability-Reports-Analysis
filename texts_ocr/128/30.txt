Anti-competitive behaviour [GRI 206-1]

With a provision of 21st January 2016, the Autorita Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato
(AGCM - the Italian Competition Authority) launched an investigation into the Italian Banking
Association concerning the possibility that the interbank agreement involving the SEDA
service? (and more specifically the remuneration mechanism inherent in it), as set forth by the
Italian Banking Association itself in a circular it issued in 2013, might constitute a resolution
for an association of companies that restricts competition. With a provision dated 13 April
2016 the AGCM decided to broaden the investigation to include some banks (including UBI
Banca), because the AGCM had found that the banks themselves were taking an active role “in
the definition of the SEDA remuneration system, also with reference to the transition stage
from the RID direct debit system to the new systems and to the treatment of mandates already
deposited”.

On 19th April 2016, concurrently with the notification of the decision for further investigation,
inspections were conducted in some branches, including UBI Banca, which was found to have
no involvement whatsoever in the alleged activities. On 7'* April 2017, the statement of
defence was filed in response to the communication of the results of the investigation and the
final hearing before the authorities was held on 13» April 2017. On 15th May 2017, the AGCM
notified UBI of the decision to close the proceeding under which, although it was found that
the parties had implemented an agreement to restrict competition, it was decided not to issue
any penalties as they were not merited by the minor violations confirmed.

Human rights [GRI 408-1 409-1 412-1:3 FS6]

As a result of the location and nature of the activities carried out, the operational framework
for risks of violations of human rights laws would seem to be strictly limited and less likely to
involve the Group's operational activities (except for the purchasing of gold and diamonds)
than to involve health and safety risks for persons in connection with products from certain
controversial economic sectors subject to credit activities.

Where these sectors are concerned, considering the strictly marginal volume of activity, the
Group has no specific policies, except for the arms sector, for which the Group adopted the
