Equal opportunity and non-discrimination

Diversity management, a matter of ethics in observing the principle of non-discrimination
enshrined in the Group's Code of Ethics and one of the 10 universal principles of the Global
Compact, is also a mechanism to enhance company performance through personnel selection
processes designed to acquire the resources most suited to the vacancies involved and
management processes to optimise employees’ individual capacities and skills.

Diversity is addressed in the framework of human resource management processes in general,
in which respect for equity and transparency are key features, with a view to utilising
differences in culture, age, gender, and abilities to the greatest advantage. More specifically,
from the management and organizational standpoint, the Group has adopted initiatives to
promote a balance between professional and private life and to support employees returning
from maternity/paternity leave and lengthy absences. Where compensation is concerned, UBI
Group has formalised remuneration and incentive policies under which compensation is based
on merit and fairness, through equitable, consistent remuneration for comparable roles and
responsibilities, offering equal career development opportunities for everyone.

Special attention is devoted to the management of disciplinary proceedings. In this connection,
UBI Banca has adopted specialised guidelines applicable throughout the Group designed to
ensure a proper, transparent approach through formally-established investigation, decision-
making and judgment processes and through periodic reporting on the measures taken.
