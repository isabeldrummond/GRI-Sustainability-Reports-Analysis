To promote equal gender opportunities, management and smart working activities have been
supplemented with training activities designed to support employees returning from
maternity/paternity leave: 47 employees participated in five editions of the “Family Work
Balance" course entailing a review of labour organisation in connection with sensitive issues of
transition and change in family, social, and labour roles.

Specific training activities targeted the generational confrontation: "Generational change:
Experience and Energy”, in seven editions, involved 158 participants from a variety of
generational settings, in an active discussion on relevant, current issues for the Group, to
attempt to exchange and learn from different experiences and to enhance communication
skills and collaboration.

Remuneration

In general, the male/female wage gap was reduced and substantially aligned in senior
management and professional areas.
