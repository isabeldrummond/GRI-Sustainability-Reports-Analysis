In summary, the Group's social responsibility model represents the Bank's system of relations
with all internal and external drivers that influence (or that will influence) the business model.
Implementation of the model is ensured through a meticulous strategic planning activity
designed to guide the Bank towards its objectives of achieving sustainable earnings in the
medium and long-terms; a corporate governance system entailing rules and processes in which
roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, and a framework of risk management and
internal supervision to anticipate and address the key risks involved in banking activity.

Key impacts, risks and opportunities [GRI 102-15 201-2]

During 2017, UBI Banca updated its reporting on sustainability topics relevant in creation of
value for the Group (material topics). In keeping with the definition of materiality under the
GRI Standards adopted with reference to the drafting of this document, material topics “reflect
a reporting organization’s significant economic, environmental and social impacts; or that
substantively influences the assessments and decisions of stakeholders.”

Topics to be subject to materiality assessment were identified with reference to external
documentary sources (references for the GRI Standards, sustainability reporting by other
banking groups and investor questionnaires from SRI and ESG rating agencies) as well as
internal sources (Business Plan, communications and statements from senior management
and results from stakeholder engagement activities).

Risks potentially affecting the Group's activities were concurrently mapped with reference to a
market benchmark and publications by international institutions (World Economic Forum,
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and Carbon Disclosure Project). Risks
were identified to reflect external factors in connection with key current global economic,
social, environmental and geopolitical trends and internal factors in connection with corporate
processes.

The topics and risks identified with this approach were subject to an assessment of UBI
Banca's front-line structure, leading to the definition of a materiality matrix indicating the
strategic priorities, used as a basis to formulate policies and objectives that also reflect risks
and opportunities potentially having significant impacts on the Group’s activities.

As the topics in connection with human rights and responsible supply chain management cut
across the identified strategic priorities, they are addressed in accordance with the many
different issues involved

Material topics [GRI 102-46:47]

UBI Banca is a leading financial intermediary on the national scene. In this capacity, it
maintains a dialogue and operates in a social, economic, and environmental context, in the
presence of numerous stakeholders, reflecting the strategic priorities in reference to the
material sustainability topics (including those listed in Legislative Decree No. 254/2016).

In achieving these strategic priorities, UBI Banca considers the risks generated and sustained
that theoretically may arise in the relative context, for which adequate regulatory and
organizational provisions are made.

Accordingly, the table below provides a list of material topics identified by UBI Banca, the
potential risks generated or sustained in the context in which the Bank operates that is typical
for a national primary financial intermediary, and the measures taken to address them.
