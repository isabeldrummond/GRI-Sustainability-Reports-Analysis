Deloitte.

In addition, for material information, taking into consideration the Group’s activities and characteristics:
e at the parent company’s and subsidiaries’ level:

a) with regards to qualitative information included in the NFS, and specifically with reference to the
business management model, policies applied and main risks, we carried out interviews and
gathered supporting documentation in order to verify its consistency with the available evidence;

b) with regards to quantitative information, we carried out both analytical procedures and limited
verifications in order to ensure, on a sample basis, the correct aggregation of data.

¢ for the following subsidiaries, Unione di Banche Italiane S.p.A., UBI Sistemi e Servizi S.C.p.A., UBI
Academy SCRL, which we selected based on their activities, their contribution to the performance
indicators at the consolidated level and their location, we carried out site visits, during which we have
met their management and have gathered supporting documentation with reference to the correct
application of procedures and calculation methods used for the indicators.

Conclusion

Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of
the Group as of December 31, 2017 is not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with article 3 and
4 of the Decree and with the GRI Standards, including the “Financial Services Sector Disclosures",
established in 2016 and 2013 by GRI - Global Reporting Initiative.

Other Matter

With reference to the year ended December 31, 2016, the Group prepared a Sustainability Report, whose
sustainability information were used for comparative purposes within the NFS. This sustainability
information was voluntarily examined by us with a limited assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE
3000 revised and we expressed an unmodified conclusion.
