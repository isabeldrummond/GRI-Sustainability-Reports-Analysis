"In 2017, the following were excluded from the professional assessment perimeter: Newly-recruited personnel, those
on leave, staff of minor companies in the Group, and personnel on external contracts. Of the total number of 2017
professional assessment cards, 24 cards were associated with employees classified as ND (external operations base)
who have not been included in this table.

A new step in the process was introduced in 2017: Self-assessment, which is the option for all
employees to express their opinions on the components being evaluated by the relevant
manager. All of the foregoing is consistent with the purpose of the instrument: awareness and
ongoing discussion to promote development paths consistent with the professional objectives
of the individuals and the requirements of the organization. This approach is also supported
by the various Assessment activities (on an individual and group basis, with supervision and
management focuses), differentiated to reflect the tools and processes in relation to the
different company populations, consistent with the scope of the activity: to gather useful
information to design a series of development activities. The 190 colleagues involved during
2017 in these initiatives have in fact benefited from individual feedback, making it possible to
provide practical follow-up on the information.

To expand knowledge of the New Banks employees and to have data to support future
management decisions, in September 2017, an online assessment activity focusing on
Business and Private consultants and senior management of branches, designed to assess
performance in this capacity in terms of technical knowledge and management skills.

Moreover, Individual coaching (20) and Team coaching (35) activities were intensified during
2017, with a view to the improved use of management skills in the Bank's specific
organizational context. In addition, the group's commitment to policies focusing on planning
appropriate generational turnover to cover prospective management roles has continued.

More specifically, management and development activities of personnel involved in the talent
project drew from ongoing management and training activities with a high level of professional
and managerial specialisation designed to promote personalised growth and functional
courses to consolidate the skills the organization requires and to create reservoirs for the
managerial turnover and continuity.
