stakeholders as a whole, in terms of reducing social costs and/or increasing the economic
development of the community. In order to achieve the maximum economic and social return
from the amounts paid out, it is important to identify and support the best initiatives in terms
of how well they match the areas where the Bank operates and their visibility/impact in the
area. This leads to “collaborative growth”, aligning social intervention with business strategies
by acting on three fronts:

e enabling growth, involving factors such as professional training, high-quality education,
improved quality of life and a reduction in the problems that lead to costs for the
community and social hardship

e strengthening demand, involving factors such as the size and quality of the relevant
markets (e.g. social housing initiatives, with actions that can support the demand for
mortgages);

e strengthening the competitiveness of communities, by encouraging investments and
development activities.

No payments, whether direct or indirect, are permitted to: political parties, movements,

Donations are made through both the Board’s Fund (reserves of profits required for this
purpose by the Articles of Association, some of which contribute to the assets of the Group’s
Foundations) and part of the income from the placement of financial products, particularly as
part of UBI Comunita initiatives. In addition to this, sponsorships* with social aims,
associating the UBI Banca brand with organisations and events, are often an expression of
their history and tradition in their respective local communities.
