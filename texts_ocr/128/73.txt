Commitment to the community

It is important for a bank with the mission to be a local community bank to be perceived as
present and nearby, attentive to the economic and social needs of the communities where it
operates. Acting as a driver not only for the economy but also for the social well-being of local
communities, it promotes the creation of strong relationships with authorities, institutions
and social organisations. In this context the support provided by the Group to families in
difficulty, the attention it pays to poorer groups in society and its contribution to important
social causes and projects are part of its overall business strategy.

In particular, the socio-economic context caused by the prolonged period of crisis has
strengthened the perception that businesses and nonprofit organisations should act in
synergy with public institutions in order to support the development of new responses to meet
the needs of society. Current changes (such as the falling birth rate, ageing population, new
forms of poverty, growing number of care-dependent older people, migrants in need of help to
integrate and youth unemployment) have revealed new categories of need with a high social
content relating to an ever-increasing number of people. UBI Banca contributes to the
response to these new needs both commercially, as the banking partner of nonprofit
organisations that provide public goods and services, and by supporting social initiatives and
projects.

The development of business activities with social aims is a heritage shared by the entire
Group, reflected in particular by UBI Comunita, which acts as an incubator for new ideas and
initiatives.

Strategic philanthropy activities - charitable donations and sponsorships - are managed on the
basis of internal regulations that formalise delegations of responsibilities and processes. Most
of this consists of donations made using specific allocations of retained earnings pursuant to
Art. 44.3 of the Articles of Association of UBI Banca amounting to 2% of the distributable part
of the net profit resulting from the annual financial statements after the minimum amount
prescribed by law for the statutory reserve has been deducted together with any amounts
decided by a General Meeting to create or increase reserves, including extraordinary or other
reserves, with a maximum of €12 million (the “Board’s Fund”).

In November 2016, as part of the revision of the Group’s organisational model at the time of
he implementation of the Single Bank Project, the Supervisory Board drew up specific
guidelines for the centralised management of the Board’s Fund and criteria for distributing
funds among the Macro Geographical Areas (MGAs). On 14th February 2017, on the basis of
hese guidelines and following prior examination by the Management Board, the Supervisory
Board approved the Regulations for the process to manage UBI Banca’s charitable donations.
Each year, on the basis of the Regulations, the Supervisory Board approves an Annual
Intervention Plan for UBI Banca, establishing general guidelines for the efficient allocation of
he available resources to the initiatives with the greatest potential for impact and change. The
Supervisory Board decides on the most far-reaching initiatives (usually inter-regional), while
ocal interventions are referred to the MGAs. In order to ensure more effective relations with
ocal communities, a Local Operational Team (LOT) has been formed for every MGA where each
MGA Manager is accompanied by a specially designated Member of the Supervisory Board
with experience of the relative local area. The LOTs are supported by the UBI Comunita Area
manager and the Head of the Corporate Social Responsibility Function. The Supervisory Board
examines the Annual Intervention Plans of the Macro Geographical Areas, verifies that they
are in substantial compliance with the annual guidelines and expresses its prior opinion on
the initiatives for which the MGAs are responsible that are defined as “major” (amounting to
€20,000.00 or more) and/or extend over several years.

 

Contributions from the donation of part of the income from products and services are defined
as part of the process for structuring them and specified in the prospectuses for the placement
of financial products.
