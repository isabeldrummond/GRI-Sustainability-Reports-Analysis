Calculation method

Paper : consumption is multiplied by the underlying CEPI coefficient which refers to energy consumed for the
production of pulp, paper and cardboard in firms/paper mills. The Confederation of European Paper Industries
(CEPI) is a nonprofit organisation which represents approximately 495 companies that produce pulp, paper and
cardboard and 900 paper mills for an overall total that accounts for approximately 22% of world production.
Business travel: energy consumption by the company car fleet already reported under disclosure 302-1 is
excluded. The kilometres travelled by air were retrieved from the IATA certified management app provided by the
travel agency. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is a trade association to which airlines from all
over the world belong and it represents approximately 280 airlines (83% of total air traffic). On the basis of the
method provided by the Italian Banking Association, the kilometres travelled for domestic, international and
intercontinental trips were multiplied by the respective coefficients calculated as the weighted average of the
main routes (number of trips and distances). The kilometres travelled by high-speed train and other types of train
were retrieved from the management app provided by the travel agency. On the basis of the method provided
by the Italian Banking Association, the kilometres travelled by train were multiplied by the respective coefficients
calculated as the weighted average of the main routes (number of trips and distances) using the app
Ecopassenger. For business travel using personal cars, the CO2 emissions (see 305-3) were divided by the
following "ISPRA - Database of average road transport emission factors in Italy" coefficients: 3,127944 tons
CO2/tons petrol and 2,992202 tons CO2/tons gas oil. The tons of fuel of obtained were multiplied by the
underlying coefficients.

Shuttle coach: the tons of gas oil were multiplied by the underlying coefficient.

ENERGY INTENSITY

Calculation method

Energy intensity does not include energy consumption outside the organisation (302-2) and was
calculated by dividing total energy consumption within the organisation (302-1) by the number of
employees and associate workers (21.465 amounting to 100 % of the Group total) and by the net internal
floor area of properties (1.267.931 sq m) of the Group companies within the relative scope.

Emissions resulting from district heating have not been included in the calculation, because the heat used is a thermal by-product
of power generation.
