Fortunately, in 2017 as well, cases effectively observed were extremely insignificant in terms of
numbers and severity.

Training (52,607 hours in 2017) is another essential component of prevention to ensure that
the concept of " Participatory security "is as widespread as possible. The training programmed
are prepared in co-operation with UBI Academy and the corporate physicians with account
taken of the different levels of risk to which employees are exposed as a function of their
individual roles. Their level of completion by each employee is monitored through an
integrated information system that can be used to program and report on training activities in
each business.
