Operations impacting personnel dynamics are reflected in the generational turnover activities
provided under the Business Plan that defines the integration of 1,100 new resources during
the three-year period 2017-2019. In accordance with trends in the distribution model and the
effort to simplify operations, the hiring of personnel from the external market mainly aims to
incorporate young new graduates, and when required, those having distinctive specialised skill
profiles not present in the Group to contribute to the development of new skills and

professional capacities.

To enhance the attractiveness of the company,
The Group's Employer branding strategy
provides a constant presence in universities in
the reference areas where hiring is
concentrated, and effective use of digital
communication channels in the form of
notices that can be used to attract active
candidates, and through targeted campaigns
that are also effective in attracting passive
candidates. Testimonials, guidelines and
social media posts have also helped improve
the spread of knowledge of UBI Banca as a
valid employment option.

In terms of the hiring of professional and senior management personnel, the desirable profiles
are predominantly local, in this case, in areas where the Group's offices, target activities and
control operations are located. In 2017, 16 new senior managers were hired from the external
market, of which 68.8% are residents in Lombardy.
