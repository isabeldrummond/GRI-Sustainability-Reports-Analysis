Fund during the first half of 2017 continues along the lines established under the Single Bank
project to serve customers in accordance with UBI Group’s highest standards: the merger
process was completed for Banca Adriatica e Carilo, Banca Tirrenica and Banca Federico Del
Vecchio and is planned in February 2018 for Banca Teatina.

The main objectives of the plan are:

e support to the real economy through increased financing, including new grants to support
enterprises operating in the third sector;

e growth in the financial wealth intermediated of customers, promoting increased saving,
including in the less affluent sectors;

e creation of value for shareholders and staff with growth in net profits;
e enhanced capital soundness with ratios consistently exceeding regulatory requirements;

e contribution to the public sector through growth in taxes deriving from higher projected
profit levels;

e contribution to the local communities by maintaining a significant level of contributions
through donations and sponsorships in support of numerous social, cultural, recreational,
athletic, social and health care, and assistance projects for grassroots entities,
organizations, and institutions;

e investments in the growth and well-being of staff members through professional training
and development programs and benefits in connection with the corporate welfare system.

The sustainability of the objectives of the Business Plan is inextricably linked to the business
model and its strengths, which can be summarized in terms of: (i) consolidated relationships
with customers driven by the ongoing quest for their satisfaction as a prerequisite for
maintaining a lasting, mutually satisfactory relationship; (ii) sound capital and liquidity
positions making it possible to lay solid groundwork for the development of the Group and to
support the real economy in compliance with the regulatory requirements; (iii) sound, prudent
assessment of financing to promote development initiatives that are not only economically
sustainable, but that are also sustainable from the social and environmental standpoints; (iv)
competent management of customers' financial wealth through tailor-made solutions reflecting
the life cycle and macroeconomic and financial environment; (v) efficient cost management,
enabling resources to be allocated to projects that optimise their use.

As a bank, we are interested in topics of sustainability, directly as a business and indirectly
through the approach our customers use in making financing and investment decisions. For
example, the valuation of credit facilities in the Project Finance sector, more specifically with
reference to health, mobility and services (water and gas systems), takes into account a broad
range of economic and financial parameters, as well as the essential considerations of
understanding environmental impacts in terms of the use of energy resources and the
emission of pollutants into the atmosphere. In servicing households' financing requirements,
we pay close attention to the sustainability of finance charges over time, in keeping with the
principles of responsible lending, which benefits the Bank as well as the customers. At the
sector level, we participate in financing benefits for customers who are victims of usury
practices to enhance social inclusion and to give persons in difficulty better access to banking
services. In terms of household savings management, we carefully assess factors of risk and
return, customers' knowledge of financial instruments and investment horizons while
promoting anti-corruption activities and the verification of provenance. Moreover, the Group’s
commitment to support local communities is well represented in terms of banking, financial,
and savings management services to the third sector, as well as in terms of partnerships to
execute projects. Last, as a business operating with more than 20,000 staff and 1,500 points
of sale, the Group has devoted much attention to human rights, by promoting diversity,
gender equality, dialogue between management and labour and protecting health and safety in
the workplace in compliance with international conventions and regulations. We ask our
suppliers to operate in accordance with UBI's Code of Ethics, in order to work together in
compliance with the same principles that underpin the Group's activities. At the
environmental level, the use of renewable energy sources has been consolidated to achieve a
sustainable energy supply in the long term.
