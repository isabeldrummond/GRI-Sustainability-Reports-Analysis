With regard to major project finance investments, the consolidation process of the ownership
and management of photovoltaic installations and to refinance many operations became
stronger in 2017, following the entry into force of the “spalma incentivi” (spread the incentives)
decree at the end of 2015.

The sector has attracted the attention of major investors because expansionary monetary
policies have always made the guaranteed returns on investments in renewables more
attractive and UBI Banca has continued to play a significant role in supporting Italian
investors, participating in some of the most interesting inter-bank transactions at a national
level. In particular, this involves the acquisition of clusters of installations (PV, wind etc.) that
have been managed using structured finance matched to output, guarantees and market
pricing. The construction of new installations has decreased.

In total, at the end of 2017 UBI Banca had a portfolio of renewable energy operations
amounting to €1.9 billion (of which €1.2 billion in project finance). The transactions concluded
during the year in the renewable energy field numbered 49, to give a total amount disbursed of
€234.2 million. It is estimated that the power output financed in project finance by UBI Banca
amounts to 1.4 million MWh of electricity per year, equal to the domestic electricity
requirement of an entire region such as Liguria, with savings on emissions of over 452
thousand tons of COz.
