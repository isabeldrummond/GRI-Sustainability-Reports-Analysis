' The reductions of 1,326 positions during 2017 under the Business Plan do not reflect the 53 terminations in
connection with the New Banks during the period 1st January until 31st March 2017.

Generational turnover activities primarily involved terminations (1,254) in connection with the
early departure plan implemented under the trade union agreements signed on 11th
December 2016 and subsequent arrangements. At the Group level, they include acquisitions
and transfers of business sectors. The substitution index was equal to approximately 41
percent, corresponding to one incoming resource for every two departures. Women accounted
for 34.70% of the personnel leaving and 63.13% of those leaving were working in locations in

Northern Italy. Voluntary turnover was substantially unchanged at 0.8% as against 0.6% in
2016 and 0.7% in 2015.
