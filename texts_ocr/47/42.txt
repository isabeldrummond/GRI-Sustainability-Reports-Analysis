GRUPPO EDITORIALE
Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

In 2018, no penalties were imposed upon A. Manzoni & C. as a result of cases of unlawfulness or
non-compliance of advertising messages in line with applicable law.

In addition to the Marketing Communication Self-Regulation Code, the Group complies with the
decree regarding misleading and comparative advertising in professional relations (Italian
Legislative Decree no. 145/07). This decree involves the adoption of a complete and comprehensive
regulation that protects professionals from misleading advertising and its unfair consequences, as
well as providing for conditions of legality in comparative advertising.

The Group operates on the basis of internal procedures and systems to safeguard and promote
honest advertising communications which do not offend the sensibilities of users. The Group
acknowledges Decree MEF-MISE (Ministry of Economy and Finance - Ministry of Economic
Development) of 19 July 2016 on the media exempt from the prohibited advertising of games with
winnings in cash.

An operating procedure to manage lawfulness (legal aspects) and opportunities (compatibility
with the editorial line of the media in question) is in force, which applies to any notice to be
published by the media under concession, through which requests can be made to evaluate
messages which are doubtful or otherwise in need of verification. In this context, where necessary,
training on issues of lawfulness is provided to agents and employees.

For example, following the introduction of Law no. 96 of 09 August 2018 relative to the “Conversion
into law, with amendments, of Law Decree no. 87 of 12 July 2018 (so-called “Dignity Decree”),
Chapter III of which was amended with new measures to combat gambling, including the ban on
advertising for gambling and bets, an informative and summary note on the prudential approach
that the company intends to follow and of the consequent behaviour to be adopted has been
disclosed.

The company intranet of A. Manzoni & C.
features a special section on “Advertising laws”.
This section is broken down into topics and
briefly describes the regulations in place which
are applicable to users, agencies and
advertising media, and therefore provides a
guide for the entire A. Manzoni & C. 2)
organisation, to be read and consulted on a
preventive basis for all advertising sale activities. This section aims to contribute to limiting litigation
and company costs and, if used appropriately, also constitutes a valid instrument for customer-
focused service activities, fostering long-term relationships. As regards online advertising and
promotional campaigns, given the relative absence of specific regulations for this platform and in
order to protect those who are most vulnerable and most influenced by advertising, the Group
follows the more restrictive regulation applicable to television advertising.

 

 

Moreover, with reference the Digital Division, the GEDI Group observes the provisions of the “White
Paper on Digital Communication”, a document prepared by the eight associations that represent
the entire supply chain of digital advertising - UPA (advertising investors), Assocom and Unicom
(communications companies), FCP Assointernet (advertising concessionaire), Fedoweb (digital
publishers), Fieg (print publishers), lab (digital advertising market standards), and Netcomm (e-
commerce companies), which requires its members to adhere to a standardised code of conduct to
protect the association as a whole. The White Paper is based on corporate governance. The “White
