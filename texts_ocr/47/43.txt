supply chain, ad fraud, brand safety and brand policy, user experience and transparency of

Privacy and data protection

The theme of privacy and personal data protection continues to be of fundamental importance in
the business domain and a rigorous and transparent policy in this area is a key factor in the
relationship with users.

This is all the more true in the publishing sector in which GEDI companies operate given that, in said
sector, the relationship between the publisher and readers is based on a strong level of trust.

Therefore, the GEDI Group, in processing the personal data of its users, employs rigorous policies
which are constantly updated in line with the applicable relevant national and European legislation,
as applied and interpreted in the provisions of the Personal Data Protection Authority. This policy
concerns, in particular, the data collected and managed through the Group's digital properties and
is centred on the principles of necessity of processing, proportionality, transparency and freedom
of choice of the interested party.

Within this context, Group companies only process the data actually needed to provide the services
and contents required by users and, in all other cases, or for commercial and marketing purposes,
do it exclusively on the basis of the free and informed consent acquired by users after having
provided them with adequate information.

For all databases in which the personal data of users, partners and associates is collected and
stored, the Group adopts all necessary technical, organisational and security measures to avert the
risk of the destruction or loss of data, unauthorised access and the unauthorised processing of data.
Also in relation to the personal data of users acquired and processes using cookies, the Group
companies observe the applicable regulations governing privacy, with particular reference to the
provisions of the Personal Data Protection Authority adopted in compliance with the provisions of
Article 122 of the Privacy Code, prior to the introduction of new European legislation.

In the course of the 2018, the subject of privacy and the protection of personal data was a matter
of primary focus for the GEDI Group. As noted above, in fact, the year was characterised by the
direct application of the new European General Data Protection Regulation (“EU Regulation no.
2016/679 - GDPR"), in response to which the Group companies implemented training activities in
2017 aimed at the correct implementation of European legislation. As such, a progressive
compliance process has been implemented which, in the course of this year, has led to significant
action being taken in this regard, as described in more detail below.

First of all, following the preliminary mapping of personal data processing procedures adopted by
Group companies, the relative registers pursuant to Article 30 of GDPR have been adopted; at the
same time, a Privacy Organisational Model has been defined aimed at defining roles and
responsibilities in terms of Privacy for each company and coordinating activities relating to Data
Protection at Group level. In the same regard, a Group Data Protection Officer has been appointed
to ensure the centralised management of action, in line with GDPR.

In accordance with the principles of transparency, information has been updated and made
available to interested parties (e.g. users, subscribers, employees, freelancer associates) and, as
regards relations with suppliers who process personal data owned by Group companies on behalf
