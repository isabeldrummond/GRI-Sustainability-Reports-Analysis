Independent auditors’ report
31 December 2018

The Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by
the Italian law, compliance with the decree’s provisions.

Auditors’ independence and quality control

We are independent in compliance with the independence and all other ethical
requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on
fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care,
confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our company applies International
Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italia 1) and, accordingly, maintains a system of
quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance
with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.

Auditors’ responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion, based on the procedures performed,
about the compliance of the NFS with the requirements of the decree and the GRI
Standards. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established by
“International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) - Assurance
Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (“ISAE
3000 revised”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board
applicable to limited assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and
perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the NFS is free
from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a
reasonable assurance engagement carried out in accordance with ISAE 3000 revised,
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become
aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable
assurance engagement.

The procedures we performed on the NFS are based on our professional judgement
and include inquiries, primarily of the parent's personnel responsible for the
preparation of the information presented in the NFS, documental analyses,
recalculations and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate.

Specifically, we carried out the following procedures:

1. Analysing the material aspects based on the group’s business and characteristics
disclosed in the NFS, in order to assess the reasonableness of the identification
process adopted on the basis of the provisions of article 3 of the decree and taking
into account the reporting standards applied.

2. Analysing and assessing the identification criteria for the reporting scope, in order
to check their compliance with the decree.

3. Comparing the financial disclosures presented in the NFS with those included in
the group’s consolidated financial statements.

4. Gaining an understanding of the following:

- the group’s business management and organisational model, with reference to
the management of the aspects set out in article 3 of the decree;

the entity’s policies in connection with the aspects set out in article 3 of the
decree, the achieved results and the related key performance indicators;

the main risks generated or borne in connection with the aspects set out in
article 3 of the decree.
