Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

Introduction
Methodology

This document is the consolidated non-financial statement (the “Non-Financial Statement”, “NFS”
or “Sustainability Report”) prepared to fulfil the obligations provided for by Articles 3 and 4 of
Legislative Decree no. 254/16 (“the Decree”) by GEDI Gruppo Editoriale S.p.A. and its consolidated
companies (“GEDI” or the “Group”), and aims to transparently describe the initiatives and main
results achieved in terms of sustainability performance in the 2018 financial year (from 01 January
to 31 December).

The NFS covers - to the extent necessary to provide a clear understanding of the activities, trends,
results and impacts of the business - the environmental and social themes regarding employees,
human rights and the fight against active and passive corruption which are relevant to the activities
and characteristics of the Group defined in the materiality index provided in this document (the
materiality analysis).

This NFS has been produced in accordance with the “Core” and the “Sector Disclosures - Media”
options of the “Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards”, defined respectively
in 2016 and 2013 by the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), considering the information deemed
significant for stakeholders and based on the principles provided for by the reporting guidelines.
The “GRI Content Index” with details of the content reported in accordance with the GRI Standards
is annexed to this document. For certain aspects of the information reported in this document, as
indicated by the aforementioned index, specific reference is made to other company documents
(such as the Report on Corporate Governance and the Ownership Structure, the Annual Financial
Statement, the Code of Ethics or the Organisational, Management and Control Model).

The data and information contained in the NFS refers to all companies of the GEDI Group as at 31
December 2018, consolidated according to the integral approach (any exceptions, in addition to
the information provided below, are expressly indicated in the text).

The process to collect the data required for the preparation of the NFS involved various Group
company departments and was carried out according to the principles of balance, comparability,
accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability expressed in the GRI Guidelines.

In order to ensure the comparability of the data and information over time and to assess the trend
of the Group’s activities over a certain period, wherever possible accounting data for the 2016 and
2017 reporting periods has been provided. Furthermore, the document includes information
relative to previous reporting periods which is still of relevance at 31 December 2018.

Moreover, it is noted that any estimated quantitative data is duly identified as such. Estimates are
based on the most accurate information available or on sample surveys.

In order to reconcile the information with the content indicated by the Decree, the relevance of the
topic to the Group's activities is indicated for each field. Moreover, the risks associated with each
topic referenced by the Decree and the management approaches adopted by the Group are duly
identified.
