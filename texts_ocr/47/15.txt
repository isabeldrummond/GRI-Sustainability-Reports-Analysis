Digital

The Digital division oversees the management and digital development of the trademarks of the
Group across all digital platforms (desktop, mobile, tablet, smart TV and latest generation devices),
as well as the diversification of the activities of the Group into new digital operations outside the
current perimeter. The distribution strategy is differentiated by platform and considers both free
and premium models: the specificity of readers’ information needs on the various platforms and
the long-term optimisation of value are drivers for the choice of model.

the Group’s main brands, particularly Repubblica.it, Repubblica +, the new premium product Rep:,

was not correctly attributed to publishers (so-called in-app browsing), in the period between April

(including international service and platform providers such as Google, Facebook and Amazon),
with an average of 5.04 million unique visitors per day and 25.5 million unique visitors per month
