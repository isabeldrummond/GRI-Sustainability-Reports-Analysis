Independent auditors’ report on the consolidated non-
financial statement pursuant to article 3.10 of Legislative
decree no. 254 of 30 December 2016 and article 5 of the
Consob Regulation adopted with Resolution no. 20267 of
18 January 2018

To the board of directors of
GED! Gruppo Editoriale S.p.A.

Pursuant to article 3.10 of Legislative decree no. 254 of 30 December 2016 (the
“decree”) and article 5 of the Consob (the Italian Commission for listed companies and
the stock exchange) Regulation adopted with Resolution no. 20267 of 18 January
2018, we have been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on the
2018 consolidated non-financial statement of GEDI Gruppo Editoriale S.p.A. (the
“parent”) and its subsidiaries (together, the “group” or the “GED! Group”) prepared in
accordance with article 4 of the decree and approved by the board of directors on

1 March 2019 (the “NFS’).

Responsibilities of the parent’s directors and board of statutory auditors
(“Collegio Sindacale”) for the NFS

The directors are responsible for the preparation of a NFS in accordance with articles
3 and 4 of the decree and the “Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting
Standards” issued in 2016 by GRI - Global Reporting Initiative (the “GRI Standards’),
which they have identified as the reporting standards.

The directors are also responsible, within the terms established by the Italian law, for
such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a
NES that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Moreover, the directors are responsible for the identification of the content of the NFS,
considering the aspects indicated in article 3.1 of the decree and the group’s business
and characteristics, to the extent necessary to enable an understanding of the group's
business, performance, results and the impacts it generates.

The directors’ responsibility also includes the design of an internal model for the
management and organisation of the group’s activities, as well as, with reference to
the aspects identified and disclosed in the NFS, the group’s policies for the
identification and management of the risks generated or borne.
