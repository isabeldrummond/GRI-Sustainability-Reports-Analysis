Total emissions of the GEDI Group in 2018 were 28 thousand tonnes of CO (total emissions
calculated with the market-based method), with a reduction of around 3% on the previous year.

Environmental impact of radio activities

Elemedia S.p.A broadcasts FM radio on behalf of the Group's three broadcasters (Radio Deejay,
Radio Capital and m2o). Transmission takes place through roughly 900 frequencies broadcast by
transmission sites where antennas on metal support frames are installed. These sites are located
primarily in mountainous areas far from inhabited areas.

The Group does not decide on the placement of broadcasting plants or technical parameters, which
are established by the Ministry of Economic Development.

The Group’s radio antennas may be checked by the ARPA (Regional Environmental Protection
Agencies), which monitor compliance with the legal limits placed on electromagnetic fields (the
limits imposed by Italian law are amongst the strictest in Europe). In any event, the emissions
generated by the Elemedia plants are a direct result of management methods based on strict
compliance with the parameters established for the concession.

To keep pollution levels systematically below the limits, the Elemedia conducts self-audits and
allocates adequate resources expressly for this reason. The Group relies on a network of inspectors
responsible for managing the plant network, who carry out periodic control and maintenance
activities. The Group also uses several probes located throughout the country and placed in some
strategic points in cities, which are used to monitor signal levels (remote control network).

Elemedia did not receive any penalties for exceeding radiation protection limits, while it is common
practice for Elemedia to undertake reduction procedures to ensure compliance.

Lastly, along with other Italian radio broadcasters, Elemedia is a member of a consortium (DAB
Italia) for the promotion and development of Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) frequencies, a digital

5 The 2016 and 2017 CO2 emissions from electricity data was recalculated following the adoption of the new methodology
proposed by the GRI Standards (adopted in the 2018 NFS) in order to ensure its comparability with the 2018 data. For the
2016 and 2017 data calculated using the old methodology, refer to the 2017 Consolidated Non-Financial Statement.
