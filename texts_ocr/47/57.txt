Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

production of higher quality paper, our paper mill suppliers use non-chlorine cellulose. Production
processes are certified by various national and international bodies to obtain sustainability labels.

In 2018, the Group consumed approximately 75 thousand tonnes of paper, a 10% reduction on the
83.5 thousand tonnes consumed in 2017 and bucking the trend set in 2016, a year in which the
Group acquired new Printing Facilities. The reduction in 2018/2017 was largely determined by the
negative distribution trend, resulting in a lower number of printed copies; the reduction in paper
usage is, in fact, closely in line with the reduction in newspaper sales which came in at
approximately 10% in the same period.

The percentage of recycled paper used within the Group, in addition to the certified paper used at
the Printing Facility in Turin, is high, representing approximately 87% of total paper usage.

As regards the type of paper used, in addition to newsprint for the newspapers, lightweight coated
and best calendered plus paper are also used for the periodicals, while TrovaRoma and TuttoMilano
are printed on improved newsprint.

As regards the other raw materials used to print the newspapers, ink and plates are of particular
significance. The Group's printing facilities use two types of technology: offset printing (Turin) and
flexographic printing (all other printing facilities).

In 2017, new offset plate development technologies were introduced; in 2018, the positive effects
of this introduction continued, with plate consumption in 2018 down 4.4% on the previous year.

In particular, the introduction of the new development units in 2017 enabled the reduction of
development liquids and maintenance cycles, while the new chemical-free plates enable larger
print runs as the plate can be reused a greater number of times.

Ink consumption also fell in 2018 (-17.5%) compared to the previous year.
