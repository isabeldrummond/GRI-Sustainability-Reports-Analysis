of the same, the relative appointments of personnel who give precise and prompt information with
regard to data processing activities have been updated, in line with the provisions of Article 28 of
GDPR.

In order to facilitate the exercise of the rights pursuant to Articles 7, 15 et seq. of GDPR, Group
companies made new contact channels available to interested parties (e.g. dedicated inbox for each
Group company), including a purpose-designed portal for digital users of the Group, available at

the following link http://richiestegdpr.gedidigital.it.

With regard to the scope of systems to support data processing activities carried out by the Group,
the Group's organisational, procedural and technical security measures have been mapped.

With regard to risk assessment, it should be noted that all processing activities were subject to an
analysis based on an ad hoc assessment process aimed at managing such matters within the Group,
following which the processing activities identified as most at risk were subject to a data protection
impact assessment pursuant to Article 35 of GDPR.

Finally, to consolidate the company privacy culture, a training programme has been activated,
focusing on the new European legislation and on the concrete application of its principles on
company processes, with the aim of promoting and raising awareness of the new policies and
operating procedures adopted (e.g. Procedure for the management of the Privacy by Design and
Privacy by Default process, Procedure for the management of the rights of data subjects, Procedure
to be followed in the case of Data Breach Management, etc.). In 2019, online training courses have
been organised for a pool of approximately 500 employees, to be delivered within the first quarter.

For the sake of full disclosure, it is noted that in 2018 a single case of unauthorised access to users’
personal data was recorded that affected GEDI News Network S.p.A., publisher of the daily
newspapers La Stampa and II Secolo XIX, among others. In particular, in April 2018 the CNAIPIC -
National Anti-crime Computer Centre for Critical Infrastructure Protection - notified GEDI News
Network S.p.A. of a possible cyber attack on the website www. ilsecoloxix.it. The Publishing House
promptly closed the identified weakness and implemented all necessary technical and
organisational measures to protect interested parties. At the same time, a report was filed with the
Postal Police and the notification of the breach was formally submitted to the Data Protection
Authority. Potentially affected users were informed of the event and invited to change their
password.
