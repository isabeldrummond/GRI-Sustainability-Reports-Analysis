Governance and integrity
The Governance model*

The GEDI Gruppo Editoriale S.p.A. corporate governance system makes it possible to achieve
strategic objectives by ensuring effective governance that complies with institutions and laws, and
which is efficient and fair towards all stakeholders. This system is based on the principles and
criteria expressed by the Code of Best Practice published in 2006 by the Borsa Italiana Corporate
Governance Committee and of which GEDI Gruppo Editoriale S.p.A. drafted its own version,
published in the Report on Corporate Governance and the Ownership Structure. The company
adopted this model on 21 February 2007. At that time, among other decisions made, the positions
of Executive Director in charge of the internal audit system, head of internal auditing and lead
independent director were established. The extraordinary shareholders’ meeting held on 18 April
2007 amended the Articles of Association so as to acknowledge the legislative innovations
regarding company law.

The various changes included the introduction of list voting for the appointment of the Board of
Directors, minimum thresholds for the presentation of the lists and the position of the executive
appointed to draw up the company accounting documents. Subsequently, the extraordinary
shareholders' meeting of 20 April 2011 adopted the necessary resolutions to complete the
adjustment of the Articles of Association to Italian Legislative Decree no. 27 of 27 January 2010, a
process undertaken by the Board of Directors on 20 October 2010. On this occasion, the Articles of
Association were amended in order to incorporate the required provisions as well as to eliminate
all regulatory references superseded by the Shareholders’ Rights regulation, also with reference to
the company’s adoption of the Procedure for Related-Party Transactions. Furthermore, due to the
amendments introduced to the Consolidated Law on Finance by Italian Law no. 120 of 12 July 2011
(“Gender Balance”) concerning equal access to the boards of directors and internal audit bodies of
companies listed on regulated markets, on 18 April 2013 the Board of Directors made the required
amendments to the Articles of Association in order to bring them into line with regulations in force.

Subsequently, the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting of 27 April 2017 resolved, among other
things, to change the Group name from Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso S.p.A. to GEDI Gruppo
Editoriale S.p.A. (GEDI S.p.A.). Finally, the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting held on 26 April
2018, considering meetings with the relevant offices of CONSOB, resolved to remove the section of
Article 15 of the Articles of Association that stated that Shareholders who, individually or jointly,
represent less than 20% of the share capital with the right to vote in the Ordinary Shareholders’
Meeting, may only present lists containing three candidates or fewer.

GEDI’s governance system consists of the following corporate boards and committees: the Board
of Directors, the Board of Statutory Auditors, the Internal Committees and the Shareholders’
Meeting.

The Board of Directors was appointed on 26 April 2018; directors serve for a period of time
established by the Shareholders’ Meeting when appointed and in any case for no longer than three
years. They can also be reappointed. The mandate of the current Board will expire with the approval
of the Financial Statements as at 31 December 2020, with the exception of Laura Cioli, co-opted
(following a resignation) by the Board of Directors of the Company on 26 April 2018, whose
appointment will be confirmed at the next Shareholders’ Meeting.
