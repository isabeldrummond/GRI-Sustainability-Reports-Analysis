Environmental impacts

The Group’s commitment to safeguarding the environment is realised through a range of initiatives
designed to minimise the environmental impact of products and production activities, for example
through the efficient use of natural resources, the optimisation of logistics flows and responsible
waste management. The Group dedicates human and financial resources to actively comply with
the extensive regulations in force for the protection of the environment and the resolution of
environmental problems, primarily deriving from industrial processes. This activity involves a broad
range of assessment and procedural activities and instrumental measurements which are carried
out every day to efficiently and comprehensively meet regulatory requirements in this area as well
as the expectations of its stakeholders.

Paper management and consumption are fundamental issues for the Group and - despite the digital
evolution at the root of the GEDI strategy - still play a very important role in terms of reducing its
environmental impact. The Group also seeks to guarantee the responsible use of its various
resources by reducing energy and water consumption and improving the management of
atmospheric emissions.

Management of paper and other raw materials

 

The paper production process is carried out entirely by the paper mills and the finished product is
then transferred to the graphic design company which looks after printing. The printed paper then
goes to the warehouses, where it is stored before distribution. The return mechanism is also worth
highlighting: after the newspaper/periodical is received by the reader, it can be collected and
recycled, or it can be disposed of with non-recyclable waste. Paper pulp deriving from the collection
of separate paper waste is sent to the paper mill for recycling.

Paper is a material of primary importance in GEDI’s industrial activities, and is also considered to
be a sensitive element due to its environmental impact. In sourcing the different types of paper
used to print its newspapers, periodicals and add-on products, the Group relies on leading
international paper mills that are able to guarantee the strictest compliance with European
environmental protection regulations. These are leading, internationally known companies in the
sector which obtain raw materials from forests with international environmental protection
certifications. All paper suppliers make use, albeit to differing extents, of DIP - or de-inked pulp -
primarily for the production of newsprint, improved newsprint and coated paper. For the
