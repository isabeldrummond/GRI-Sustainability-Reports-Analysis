The Group's role as an information provider and responsibility to the community

GEDI acts transparently and responsibly with respect to society and its stakeholders, holding fast to
the concepts of quality and integrity. It is also committed to boosting public awareness surrounding
sustainability by encouraging constructive and respectful debate.

Considering the effects of its activities on the economic and social development and general welfare
of the community, when creating and distributing content and interacting and engaging with users,
GEDI is committed to providing an accurate and high-quality news service that respects the
different religious, political, scientific and social views of the public. To do this, the Group interacts
with users continuously while also maintaining its independence from all types of influence.

Content quality

GEDI ensures the continuous alignment of its product content with the values and principles of the
Group - laid out and disclosed to all employees through the Code of Ethics - and works to ensure its
quality, plurality and diversity, while also taking into account industry regulations.

To ensure the high quality of all of its products, GEDI operates with the utmost respect for freedom
of expression, a matter of fundamental importance for any media organisation. Guaranteeing
content plurality and freedom of expression by providing an independent product is a fundamental
value and constitutes the most basic asset for a publisher, which goes hand in hand with the desire
to offer the highest number of products to an increasingly broad audience of users. At the same
time, the Group guarantees compliance with standards and protects the intellectual property of
every content provider.

The quality of the information and content generated is also accompanied by a content distribution
methodology that reflects the Group’s values, considering that the Group works to improve and
promote access and the right to information for everyone, including minorities, the disabled and
isolated communities.

Independence and editorial responsibility

In the development of its publishing products, the Group does all of the groundwork to ensure that
journalists, artists and other freelance associates can act in accordance with the principle of
editorial independence, which translates into the development of quality content that is not
influenced by interests aside from those of journalism and the right to truthful and correct
information.

In 2017 the Repubblica Code of Ethics was published. The founding principles of this Code of Ethics
are precision, credibility and transparency: these are the core values of a news service based on
readership trust, an increasingly important factor in times of great scepticism fuelled by the
presence of fake news and an extremely vast range of sources where the search for quality content
has become increasingly complicated.

Specifically, la Repubblica has outlined specific standards aimed at providing traceable news which
corresponds to precise ethical principles in order to guarantee its contents. To do so, la Repubblica
has signed up to the Trust Project, an international consortium of media and digital companies,
introducing into its own digital content the “trust indicators” which help readers to choose high
quality, traceable information certified according to the code established by the organisation and
shared with partners.
