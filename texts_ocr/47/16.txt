RADIO ALLO STATO PURO

m2o
Acquired by the Espresso Group in 1998
under its former name Italia Radio, the
station was restyled and relaunched as
m2o in late 2002 to become a dance music
station aimed exclusively at a young
audience. Since 2010 it has expanded its
musical range to include hit tracks while
maintaining the high-energy appeal that
has always characterised the station. With
an average daily listenership of 1.6 million
people (RadioTer survey, 2018) m2o
boasts a unique identity in the radio
industry and is the only station able to
develop close affinities with young people
while also appealing to older listeners.
Since the end of 2018 the artistic director
of m2o has been Albertino, one of radio's
best-known personalities. His musical

expertise, ability to spot trends and
unique delivery, combined with his
profound understanding of public
opinion, affords the station an

authoritative and respected voice while
guaranteeing attention to detail, quality,
creativity and innovation.
