Model 231 and anti-corruption

In order to ensure correctness and transparency in the performance of its business and company
activities and to prevent the crimes envisaged by Legislative Decree no. 231/2001, the Company
and its subsidiaries have adopted an “Organisational, Management and Control Model” that is
periodically updated in order to ensure the continuous correspondence of the same with any
changes to legislation or the company structure. The document is composed of a “General Part”
which, as well as referencing the principles of Legislative Decree no. 231/01 and the guidelines
issued by Confindustria, illustrates the key content, employee training methods and the
dissemination of the same within the company. It is followed by a “Special Part” which includes the
map of the sensitive areas, the Code of Ethics, the code of conduct, the general principles of the
internal control system and the control protocols developed for all at-risk company processes. In
particular, the protocols highlight the crimes that can be committed in relation to individual
processes, provide guidance on conduct and outline specific control activities to largely eliminate
the relative risks of crime. An extract from the Model can be viewed in the “Governance” section
of the corporate website.

On 05 March 2018, the company’s Board of Directors approved the revision of the Organisation,
Management and Control Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01, proposed in
agreement with the Supervisory Body and based on prior approval by said entity.

The amendments made were assessed as part of and following a wider process of revision and
updating of the organisational models of all subsidiaries and/or associates and were introduced,
including with reference to its general implementation, in order to align with recent changes to
