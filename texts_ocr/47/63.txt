Waste management

GRI 306-2 In line with its focus on environmental protection and the responsible use of resources, GEDI also
works to reduce waste produced by its core operations. The Group raises the awareness of its
employees with regard to proper waste disposal and management and the minimisation of waste.

In 2018, waste production rose slightly, with the increase of 9.2% compared to 2017 due largely to
the increase in non-hazardous waste. This contribution was partly the result of the changes to the
management method of certain types of industrial water at the Rome Printing Facility which,
discharged as surface water until the first six months of 2018, were later managed as non-hazardous
waste.

The percentages of hazardous and non-hazardous waste were 32% and 68% respectively, in line
with the previous year. In 2018, approximately 8% of waste was recycled.

8 The 2016 and 2017 data for Group water abstraction was recalculated following the adoption of the new methodology
proposed by the GRI Standards (adopted in the 2018 NFS) in order to ensure its comparability with the 2018 data. For the
2016 and 2017 data calculated using the old methodology, refer to the 2017 Consolidated Non-Financial Statement.
