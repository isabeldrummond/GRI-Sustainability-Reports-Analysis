The internal control and risk management system is the set of rules, measures and organisational
structures that, beginning with the adequate identification and evaluation of the risks to which the
Company and its operating sectors are exposed, enables risks to be managed and monitored in an
efficient and timely manner.

This system, as outlined in the Report on Corporate Governance and the Ownership Structure that
can be consulted in the Governance section of the Group's website, is based on the general
principles and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors and subdivided as follows:

e Control and Risk System which, in addition to the principles expressed in the guidelines,
includes the provisions of the Articles of Association and internal regulations in the area of
the allocation and delegation of responsibilities, the system of delegation, procedures and
risk areas mapped by the Organisational Model and, finally, risk assessment goals and
methods;

e Tasks of the bodies and functions of the Control and Risk System, which defines the
functions responsible for the Control and Risk System in terms of their roles and expertise
and in accordance with the indications in the guidelines and in the applicable legislative,
regulatory and internal provisions;

e Risk management, which is structured into three different levels of control distinguishing
between internal departments, which identify risks and carry out management actions, risk
management departments, which carry out constant analysis and monitoring, and the
Internal Audit department, which oversees the functioning of the System and provides
independent assessments.

The definition of the nature and the level of risk compatible with the company’s goals is the
responsibility of the Board of Directors, following the opinion of the Control and Risk Committee;
to this end, the suitability of the internal control and risk management system with respect to the
characteristics of the business and the risk management profile assumed is assessed at least once
a year.

The review, discussion and definition among the Board of Directors of the nature and level of risk
compatible with the Group's business objectives is implemented through a critical analysis of the
assessment of probability/impact performed by the Risk Manager and previously established by the
Control and Risk Committee in consideration of risk parameters connected to different analysis
perimeters.

The Risk Manager works in close collaboration with process managers and the Internal Audit
Department Manager, carrying out a complete review and constantly monitoring the risks, and
considering any changes to the boundaries made in the course of the year at organisational and
corporate level.

Specifically, the activities of the Risk Manager consist of the following actions:

e Mapping of company processes and implementation of the relative updates, when
necessary;

e Annual identification of internal and external risks in reference to individual processes;

e Measurement of risks in terms of probability/impact and assessment of the effect on
different affected perimeters;
