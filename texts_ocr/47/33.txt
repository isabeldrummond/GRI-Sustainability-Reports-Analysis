Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018

Financial performance

In 2018, as in previous years, GEDI carried out its activities placing the utmost attention on the
citizen-reader and seeking to improve the quality of its products and services. Success in these
activities cannot be achieved without economic and financial stability. The capacity to create
independent, high-quality content is closely associated with economic independence and stability
and, despite this difficult period of great change for the publishing and media industry in recent
years, the Group has been able to generate a positive margin by ensuring a quality product for its
stakeholders.

Financial highlights

In terms of its principle financial results, from 01 January 2018 the Group adopted the following
new accounting standards: i) IFRS 15 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and ii) IFRS 9 -
Financial Instruments (for more details see the Annual Financial Report).

To guarantee that the data is comparable, the items of circulation and advertising revenues in the
income statement for 2017 have been restated, and the item “costs for services” has also been
adjusted for the same amount, according to the new indications introduced by IFRS 15. This
restatement did not impact on the operating profit, the profit for the period or shareholders’
equity.

Regarding the comparability of data, it should be noted that on 27 June 2017 the merger of the
ITEDI Group into GEDI was completed. Therefore, the consolidated income statement for 2017
includes the results of the ITEDI Group from 01 July 2017 onwards.
