GED! Group
Independent auditors’ report
31 December 2018

Moreover, we checked the above against the disclosures presented in the NFS
and carried out the procedures described in point 5.a).

5. Understanding the processes underlying the generation, recording and
management of the significant qualitative and quantitative information disclosed in
the NFS.

Specifically, we held interviews and discussions with the parent’s management
personnel and personnel of GED! News Network S.p.A., GEDI Distribuzione
S.p.A., GEDI Printing S.p.A., Elemedia S.p.A. and A. Manzoni & C. S.p.A.. We
also performed selected procedures on documentation to gather information on
the processes and procedures used to gather, combine, process and transmit
non-financial data and information to the office that prepares the NFS.

Furthermore, with respect to significant information, considering the group's
business and characteristics:

- at group level,

a) we held interviews and obtained supporting documentation to check the
qualitative information presented in the NFS and, specifically, the business
model, the policies applied and main risks for consistency with available
evidence,

b) we carried out analytical and limited procedures to check the correct
aggregation of data in the quantitative information;

we visited GEDI News Network S.p.A. and GEDI Printing S.p.A., which we
have selected on the basis of their business, contribution to the key
performance indicators at consolidated level, to meet their management and
obtain documentary evidence supporting the correct application of the
procedures and methods used to calculate the indicators.

Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us
to believe that the 2018 consolidated non-financial statement of the GEDI Group has
not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of
articles 3 and 4 of the decree and the GRI Standards.

Other matters

The group prepared a 2016 sustainability report and has presented the data included
therein for comparative purposes in its NFS. That sustainability report was reviewed
by other auditors in compliance with ISAE 3000 revised, not pursuant to any legal
requirements, who expressed an unqualified conclusion thereon on 9 June 2017.
