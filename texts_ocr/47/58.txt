of the Group, in 2018 gas consumption fell by 36,290 m?, representing approximately 3.5% of total
annual natural gas consumption.

Natural gas is used mainly to heat the Group offices.

?Group electricity consumption includes high-frequency absorption. As regards natural gas, the conversion parameter
applied was 9.7 (as notified by the Lazio Region in 2016) in order to include a precautionary margin of plant efficiencies.

3The conversion factors used to calculate energy consumption refer to electricity and thermal energy (1 kWh = 0.0036
GJ); in 2018, for natural gas and fuel oil the coefficients provided by the Ministry of the Environment were used.
