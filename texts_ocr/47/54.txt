Worker health and safety

GEDI has always been committed to protecting the integrity, health and well-being of its workers
at all of its workplaces. The Group actively complies with legal requirements and obligations
regarding health and safety in the workplace and ensures that they are applied in all of its
companies. This takes place through the definition of organisational structures based on specific
operating responsibilities, managerial responsibilities, the planning of prevention activities over
time, the preparation of the relative expense budget, and the ongoing use of all technical support
required to assess and reduce risks. Particular focus is dedicated to staff training based on roles -
workers, supervisors and executives - depending on the risks to which they are exposed and their
specific tasks and duties.

In 2018, with the collaboration of various company departments and the relative managers, for
each production department all relevant data regarding working practices and the methods of
execution of ordinary and extraordinary activities was collected in order to promptly identify the
risks, attributing them to the job in question and evaluating the risk profiles. The analysis process
continued with the identification of the prevention and protection measures which would enable
the employee health and safety standards to be improved. The actions implemented after the risk
assessment regard training activities, as described in the relevant paragraph of this report. The
hierarchical control system involves all internal subjects (Employer, Executives, Managers and
Employees) and represents an effective tool for monitoring health and safety.

With regards to the safety of industrial plants, particular attention was given to verification and
assessment activities during the design and acquisition of new machinery and the reorganisation
and reconfiguration of machines and production cycles, with particular attention to the criteria
regulating the introduction and management of substances and chemicals. Working conditions and
operating procedures are continuously monitored to regularly improve worker health and safety
levels. Furthermore, although a specific safety management system has not been implemented,
operating instructions and procedures have been circulated for some time, representing an
important prevention measure at printing facilities in particular. The preparation of these
documents involved the managers and workers of the operational unit, promoting the adoption
and constant application of safety practices.

In 2017 an online safety training course was offered to all employees while in 2018 the training
activities and obligatory five-year health and safety refresher courses were continued for
administrative staff and journalists and for employees operating in printing facilities (manual
workers, maintenance workers and technicians). Furthermore, specific training courses for
