Returns and pulp

Unsold copies of publications (“returns”) are returned to newsagents by Local Distributors
who count and account for the same. Returns are generally collected from the warehouses of
local distributors on pallets by a single operator responsible for collecting the return and sent
to two depots, in central Italy and the other in Northern Italy. These depots count and certify
them and if they are add-on products (Books, CDs, DVDs etc.), they are sorted. Copies in
perfect condition are made available for sale through the back issues service while the
remainders are pulped.

In recent years the mechanism of the certified return of 17,913 tonnes of

pulped returns
collected by local
distributors in
2017

publications has been introduced. This consists of processing
returns by local distributors through certification and, at the
same time, pulping. As at 31 December 2018, 70 certificates
were issued by the Certified Returns Body (concerning 47 out
of 60 active local distributors) enabling local distributors to A
pulp the publications directly on-site. In 2018, local pulp

totalled approximately 17,913 tonnes.

This led to a significant reduction in the volume of copies that the returns collection company
had to transport, store and collect, with a significant positive impact on the environment.

 

‘Italian Law Decree no. 135 of 14 December 2018 concerning “Urgent provisions regarding support and simplification for
businesses and the Public Administration” was published in Issue no. 290 of the Official Journal, pursuant to which, from
01 January 2019, the SISTRI system was abolished.
