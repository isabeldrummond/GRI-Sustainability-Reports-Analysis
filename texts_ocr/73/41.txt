The HSE function, depending on its origin and danger, classifies the waste generated by the activities in
“urban” or “special” and in “hazardous” or “non-hazardous,” according to the respective EWC code. All
types of waste are collected separately in dedicated areas that, in the case of special hazardous waste,
are paved with waterproof floors or provided with containment tanks to prevent potential leakages. The
HSE function also has the task of coordinating all the activities required by law (FIR, loading and unloading
register, MUD, SISTRI) and of organizing the transport and transfer of waste to the disposal / recovery
plant, also through the selection of suppliers and the verification of their compliance with all applicable
legislations.

Since 2018, Intercos has launched a tendering procedure related to waste management of Agrate and
Dovera sites. The tender aims at selecting the best suppliers available through an evaluation process that
includes not only legislative, authorization and economic criteria, but also related to quality and responsible
management of activities (e.g. adoption of ISO 9001:2015 or ISO 14001:2015 certifications, registration
on the White List of service providers and workers not subject to attempted Mafia infiltration, etc.). It should
also be noted that, since 2018, with a view to transparency and traceability, suppliers of waste disposal
services for the Agrate and Dovera plants have been required to provide evidence of their
recycling/recovery, where applicable.

Intercos Technology (SIP) Co., Ltd and Intercos Cosmetics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd have adopted a specific
procedure for the prevention of pollution and the correct management of waste, based on the provisions
of the Chinese national legislation (Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention of
Environmental Pollution Caused by Solid Waste). All the waste generated by the activities of the
production plant are classified in: recyclable (paper, plastic, metals, etc.), undifferentiated (construction
waste, food, gardening, etc.), hazardous (inks, additives, detergents, glues, fluorescent lamps, etc.),
industrial (dirty clothes and paper, lipstick, mascara, powders, emulsions and other raw materials, etc.)
and waste (finished products, materials and packaging). Depending on the category to which it belongs,
all waste is collected in special containers that must be properly closed, provided with a specific label and
made of materials that do not allow any kind of chemical reaction with the waste contained therein. The
waste produced by the plant must be transferred to the warehouse that collects it and, if it is dangerous,
stores it in a special area (Hazardous Waste Storage Room). The HSE function, with regard to hazardous
waste, has the task of compiling and managing the documentation in compliance with the applicable
national legislation (double copy modules for the transfer of hazardous waste) and to contact the suppliers
for the transportation and transfer of hazardous waste to the disposal plant. Instead, non-hazardous waste
is managed directly from the warehouse that supplies it to special waste collection stations, in the case of
recyclable waste, or to public landfills, in the case of undifferentiated waste. If there is no specific
procedure for industrial waste, the companies use a special disposal procedure their disposal. Interfila
Cosmetics (Shanghai) Co., Ltd has adopted a specific procedure for the management of environmental
aspects that includes specific waste management provisions. Waste is classified as hazardous waste,
such as oils, paints, inks and detergents, and in general waste such as packaging and wood chips.
Following the identification of hazardous and generic waste, the site identifies suitable areas for waste
storage, based on their classification. The company manages waste disposal activities with the aim of
minimizing the amount of waste produced and of carrying out the correct treatment and disposal process
where it is not possible to facilitate its recovery.

Intercos do Brasil Industria e Comércio de Productos Cosméticos LTDA has adopted a specific procedure
that establishes the criteria for the disposal of generated waste and is based on the provisions of the
Brazilian national legislation (NBR 10004: 2004 - Residuos Sdlidos - classificagao). The waste produced
by the plant is classified on the basis of a color scale: blue for office paper, newspapers, magazines and
cardboard; red for plastic; orange for hazardous chemical waste (e.g. batteries of electronic devices);
green for glass; black and gray for industrial or contaminated waste; yellow for metals; and brown for
organic waste. All waste, based on the specific type, is collected in different areas and in suitable and
adequately identified containers and is entrusted to external companies authorized for their treatment, in
the case of hazardous waste, and subsequent disposal.
