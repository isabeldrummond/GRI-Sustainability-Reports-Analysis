Within the beauty industry, Intercos is active in the following sectors: decorative cosmetics (make up or color

cosmetics), skin care products, hair and body care products. Intercos operates in a highly competitive market,
characterized by the need to constantly innovate in order to meet consumers’ requests, which are increasingly
sophisticated in terms of both quality and safety of the product and in terms of sustainability.

Make-up products are characterized by a short life cycle, due to the high innovation component that
distinguishes them and their close interrelation with the fashion world. They include:

e Powders: dry facial powders (foundations, blushes, bronzers and illumining powders), dry eye powders
(eyeshadows) and wet powders, including baked powders (i.e. powders cooked through a baking
process in special terracotta terrines) and gel powders (i.e. powders that become soft to the touch thanks
to their gel content, patented by the Intercos Group with the name of "prisma shine"), and finally baked
injections (i.e. fluid powders injected into the pads and dried through an automated production cycle to
facilitate the creation of multicolour pallets);

e Foundations and face products such as emulsions or gels, in the form of sticks, fluids or pencils (chubby),
for example foundations, correctors, illuminants, bronzers, blushes and primers. This category includes
creams that can be used for both decorative and treatment purposes, the so-called BB creams (beauty
balm or balsam), CC creams (color corrector or colored creams) and DD creams (daily defence or anti-
smog or screen-creams);

e Lip products, i.e. lipsticks, primers, lip gloss, pencils, and other lip products for decorative and/or
beneficial use such as hydration and antioxidant effects;

e delivery systems such as pencils (in wood or plastic, to be tempered or mechanical) for eyes and
eyebrows, kajal, fluid eyeliners and mascara, for which the packaging system is essential for the
correct application and performance of the product and therefore the need for innovation lies not only in
the formula but also in the ideation and designing of the packaging;

e nail products: colored glazes (lacquered, opaque, pearly or glittered), transparent nail polish, curative
products (reinforcing and smoothing polish, polish with active ingredients, cuticle products, etc.) and
finally the solvents for nail polish removal.

As for the skin care segment, skin care products are mainly divided into:

e emulsions, in particular oil / water emulsions, characterized by hydrodispersibility, easy extensibility and
rapid absorption, such as protective day creams, moisturizers, emollients, and cleansing creams,
depilatory creams and sunscreens; water / oil emulsions, characterized by water repellency and the
formation on the skin of a lipid film such as night creams, anti-wrinkle and nourishing cream masks,
foundations and creams for children.

e oils, i.e. anhydrous products containing active ingredients and antioxidant fragrances in an oily vehicle
such as baby oils, sun oils, massage oils and treatment oils.
aqueous fluids: tonics, micellar waters, spray deodorants or hair fixers.
gels: aqueous (serums, masks, hair fixers), anhydrous (for sun protection) and above all foaming agents,
meaning products for skin hygiene performing a cleaning and foaming action.

Finally, hair & body segment includes: shampoos, gels, shower gels, body lotions, face and hand creams,
aftershaves, toothpastes and soaps.

 

The Group's success is based on its ability to cover all the geographical areas that have the greatest potential
for development and to be innovative in all stages of the production process: from the research and testing of
raw materials to the formulation and development of finished products; from the conducting of compatibility
and market studies, to the designing of the packaging; from the ideation to the scale production of the products.

As of December 315', 2019, the Intercos Group is present in Europe, North and South America and in Asia
with 15 production plants in Italy, France, Switzerland, Poland, China, the United States, Brazil and South of
Korea’, as well as commercial offices and 11 research and development centers all over the world (Figure 1).
