Below are the figures for direct GHG emissions (scope 1), which derive mainly from the consumption of
fuels, in particular natural gas (69%), and from the use of refrigerant gases (27%) in refrigeration and air
conditioning systems. In particular, Italy (67%) is the country that provides the largest contribution in terms
of GHG emissions (scope 1), followed by China (17%) and the United States (12%). The significant
increase in COz2 emissions at Group level is mainly due to the increase in natural gas consumption in Italy,
to the cogeneration system activation at the Cosmint site in Olgiate Comasco in early 2019, and the
increase in refrigerant gas leaks in America and China, due to the malfunction of some machinery used
in the production process.

Below is the data on indirect GHG emissions (scope 2), which derive mainly from the consumption of
electricity. As of December 31s, 2019, for what concerns indirect GHG emissions (scope 2), the Intercos
Group emitted, considering the location-based approach, 20,904 tons of COzeq of which 40% both in Italy
and in China, followed by the United States (12%), the rest of Europe (6%) and Brazil (2%). Considering
the market-based approach, there is a clear reduction in CO2zeq emissions in Italy compared to the location-
based approach as Intercos, in Agrate and Dovera plants, has started to purchase green certified energy
coming from renewable sources.
