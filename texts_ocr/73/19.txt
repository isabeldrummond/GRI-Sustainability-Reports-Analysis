Description of the risk

The cultivation of palm oil (of
which Intercos uses some
derivatives) in some particular
regions of the world, caused and
continues to cause deforestation
issues, with consequent impacts
on climate change and on the
loss of biodiversity.

The use of chemicals, whose use
is limited and regulated by EU
and international regulations (e.g.
REACH), may be potentially
harmful to the environment.

Activities involving the handling,
collection and disposal of waste
and hazardous substances may
potentially result, if not accurately
managed, the contamination of
soil, surface or underground
waters due to spills on the
ground, and impacts related to
the incorrect disposal of waste
could have been recovered.

The absence of an emissions
management program could
expose the Group to a potential
reputational and legislative risk
when called to report its
environmental performance
because of the increase in
international, European and
national pressures on this issue

The emission of substances
could cause, if the appropriate
rules are not applied, impacts
connected to air pollution and, in
particular emergency conditions,
also harmful effects for the
people and the environment
surrounding the emission point.

The disposal of wastewater could
potentially generate, if not
appropriately managed, the
pollution of the ground, of surface
water or of groundwater, due to
