During 2019, Intercos Group’s Makeup and Skincare segments used more than 4,000 tons of raw
materials in their production processes. Almost 50% of the raw materials used for the crafting of their
products are synthetic and includes silicones, solvents, polymers, synthetic waxes and viscosizers.
Renewable raw materials®, that represent approximately 2.5% of the total supplied, mainly consist of:
vegetable oils and waxes, organic fillers, vegetable derived oils, essential oils and organic oils.

With reference to the raw materials purchased from Cosmint and Tatra Spring (Hair & Body segment),
companies that operate mainly by third parties, it should be noted that, out of a total of 8,136 tons, 71% is
made up of natural raw materials, 10% of inorganic raw materials and 19% from synthetic raw materials.
Renewable raw materials, mostly made up of alcohol, are estimated to be about 67% of the total
purchased.
