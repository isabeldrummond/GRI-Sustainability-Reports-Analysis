training courses, verify that the third party companies involved in the management of fluorinated gases
are regularly registered at the National Register of Fluorinated Gases (F-GAS Register), as required by
Presidential Decree 43/2012, and guarantee the correct disposal of gases by certified personnel.

The tables below report data on Intercos’ energy consumption, direct and indirect GHG emissions and air
pollutant emissions (e.g. VOCs).

The energy consumption of Intercos Group derives mainly from the procurement of electricity for its
production activities and use of fuels, such as gasoline and natural gas. About the purchasing of electricity,
Italy recorded the highest consumption (47%), followed by China (27%), United States (14%), Brazil (7%)
and the Rest of Europe (4%). As of December 31*', 2019, the Intercos Group consumed 57,444 liters of
gasoline, 138,957 liters of diesel and 4,359,685 m° of natural gas and purchased 48,742 MWh of
electricity. In Italy, figures show a significant increase in natural gas consumption and a simultaneous
reduction in electricity consumption: this is mainly due to the activation of the cogeneration system at
Cosmint site in Olgiate Comasco at the beginning of 2019.
