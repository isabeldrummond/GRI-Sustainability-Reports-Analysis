Reporting Process and Calculation Methodology

The definition of the 2019 NFI contents involved all the business functions that are responsible for the aspects
reported in the NFI.

The main methodologies used for the calculations are reported below:

e the ratio between the remuneration received by men compared to that of women was calculated by
adding to the base salary the figures related to the Management By Objectives (MBO) paid in the year
on the basis of the cash criterion. The remuneration was calculated only for Executives and Managers,
which are the only categories that can fully benefit from this type of incentive. In fact, some functions
among the Employees category fall within the incentive plan but they are not representative of the
whole category;

e the injury rate is the rate between the total number of injuries with absences exceeding one day and
the total number of worked hours, multiplied by 1,000,000; the commuting injuries are excluded from
the calculation of the injury rate;

e the lost day rate is the rate between the total number of lost days and the total number of hours
scheduled to be worked, multiplied by 1,000;

e lost days represents the calendar days lost from the day after the injury;

e the absenteeism rate is the ratio between the days of absence during the reporting period and the total
number of workable hours in the same period;
