Selection and monitoring of suppliers’ performance according to social criteria

Intercos is committed to ensuring the respect for human rights and labor rights along its supply chain.
When selecting new suppliers and monitoring the performance of existing suppliers, the company, in
addition to considering commercial and product quality criteria, also focuses on their ethical performance
(safety, human rights, compliance with local legislation) and evaluates them through on-site visits, the
completion of a questionnaire and any other specific measures based on current needs.

Intercos specifically monitors the aspects related to human rights also outside the organization, in
particular in China where the most part (60%) of the Group’s procured packaging is generated, and where
legislation is acknowledged to be more flexible regarding those very topics. The evaluation of Chinese
suppliers is performed through the compilation of a detailed Check List (which contains about 250
questions, of which more than 30 are dedicated to social responsibility) and the audits at the supplier's
facilities. Since 2017, the function that manages the selection and monitoring of the performance of raw
material and packaging suppliers is centralized at Group level and supported by a local team to carry out
audits in China.

The Responsible Mica Initiative

Mica, an essential mineral in the cosmetic industry, especially valuable for the production of eye shadows
because of its pearly effect, is still too often extracted by children, especially in India. The mica supply chain is
complex and globalized, involving several intermediaries, processors and traders on different continents from
the mine to the end user. To face the potential risk of being indirectly involved in child labor, Intercos joined the
"Responsible Mica Initiative" in 2017, a global association that crosses all sectors, private, public and non-
profit, with the aim to promote a correct and sustainable mica supply within the Group.

100% of Indian mica suppliers are certificate RMI members.

Key pillars of the initiative are:

1. The implementation of fair and sustainable mica mining and processing practices and the
improvement of traceability along the value chain;

2. The empowerment of local communities to ensure positive long-term change through development
programs;

3. The collaboration with the Indian government and local authorities to ensure an appropriate legal
framework is in place.
