We Value Diversity

Gender diversity represents a distinctive element for the company and a strength in the entire industry,
generally oriented towards the female world.

The Intercos Group is indeed traditionally characterized by a strong presence of women, not only among
its employees and workers, but also at the managerial level, albeit to a different extent depending on the
functions and geographical area of reference. For Intercos, diversity is a value, also guaranteed through
the Company’s policies, which condemn all forms of discrimination in all phases of the employment
relationship, with particular reference to employee selection and development processes, the
establishment of the employment relationship and training and education.

Furthermore, Intercos commits to preserve diversity also outside the Company perimeter, through the
promotion of specific paths aiming at recruiting and including people in social unfavorable conditions within
the Group.

Our Solidarity recruiting programs

Intercos Group is aware of its contribution to the development of the local communities where it operates
and is are aware of being responsible for people who are too often disadvantaged. For this reason, the
Group promotes solidarity recruiting programs and supports NGOs or local organizations operating in the
Countries where it operates.

In Italy, 2019 has witnessed the renewal of the program “Without borders” launched in 2018 together with
an external specialized society. Thanks to local authorities and associations, the project has allowed the
initiation of numerous contacts with asylum seekers in the territories of Agrate and Dovera, offering them
the opportunity to attend a training course aimed at teaching the skills and abilities necessary to become
a production operator. During the course, people had the opportunity to visit the two plants, talk to
production managers and be evaluated by their tutor. 14 people were therefore selected for an internship
in the company and, among these, a total of 9 were placed in our staff (4 in the Agrate plant and 5 in the
Dovera plant).

In the United States, in continuity with previous years, Intercos promotes the company onboarding of
military veterans with technical skills and abilities suitable for the company’s type of business, who would
otherwise have had difficulty to find a job. In recent years, various collaborations have also been activated
with associations that assist refugees from war zones who may have technical skills that can be spent
within the company, a process that has led to the recruitment of veterans and war refugees from Syria,
Iraq and Afghanistan in Intercos’ America plants.

In continuity with previous years, Intercos promotes specific solidarity recruiting initiatives in Brazil as well
through the Contratar Legal project, with particular attention to economically vulnerable communities in
the city of Atibaia. In coming years, the Group commits to expanding the initiative in other villages too.
