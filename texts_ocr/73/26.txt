Our talents are a resource

The management of the aspects linked to talents’ attraction development are delegated to a central
Human Rights function, reporting directly to the CEO, which, in collaboration with the individual local units,
ensures the correct application of company policies and manages the recruitment, training and career
development activities at the Group level.

The selection and internal mobility processes

The selection and recruitment processes are managed, according to the specific current needs, by the
individual local units with the support, where necessary, of the Company’s relevant functions or the
Corporate Human Resources division. Furthermore, as a demonstration of the Group’s commitment to
contribute to the professional growth of its resources, Intercos promotes, where possible, internal mobility
opportunities before considering the recourse to external recruitment processes.

Over the last few years, in Italy Intercos has offered internal mobility paths for its employees who, after a
specific selection process, had the possibility to undertake an international exchange experience with the
Group’s foreign subsidiaries. The employees who participated to this program had the opportunity to
change Business Unit and deployment, thus enriching their personal and professional experience. Since
its birth, the International Mobility program allowed several young talents to be granted with an experience
in different countries, among them: USA, China, France and South of Korea.

In order to attract qualified resources and increase the visibility of its brand, Intercos collaborates with
schools and universities, organizes specialized courses and promotes employer-branding policies to bring
young people and professionals closer to the cosmetics sector and the Group.

Employee training

Once in the company, new recruits participate in a training session aimed at facilitating their insertion. The
training program is defined locally by each company function based on the guidelines defined by the
Group's Human Resources division. It includes a general presentation of the company, its policies and
safety rules, as well as specific training modules based on the role and tasks to be performed by the new
employee.

Furthermore, starting from 2019’s last quarter, Welcome Days were introduced, a unique induction day
organized at the HQs in Agrate Brianza, dedicated to the new employees and designed to improve and
make the onboarding process more efficient. Sustainability and Social Responsibility are among the
corporate issues covered by the initiative. At present, the Welcome Day is scheduled for new employees
at the offices in Agrate, Dovera and Romanengo, but it will be gradually extended to the other Group’s
subsidiaries as well.

Professional development and skills improvement programs continue following the insertion phase. The
Human Resources division carries out every year a planning of the training activities that aim to enhance,
develop and retain talents within the Group. This activity is undertaken in collaboration with the managers
of the various company departments who have the task of identifying the training needs and objectives for
all employees, depending on their area of expertise.

In Italy Intercos offers a training about relationship’s efficacy, aiming at improving communicational and
relational skills with colleagues and clients, through useful methods to face the most critical and conflictual
situations. The training intends to encourage a transparent dialog among colleagues, given that in order
to find common solutions, people should know all points of view, and broaden perspectives.

In continuity with last year’s program, Intercos kept on deploying “Future Leader” that, through a
continuative path composed by a continuous assessment of competences and potentials, aims at building
the future managers of the Group.
