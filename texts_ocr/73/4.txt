The Group Today — General Information

The Intercos Group, born in 1972 from the passion and ambition of its founder Dario Ferrari, is today one of
the leading business to business ("B2B") operators for the ideation, production and marketing of cosmetic and
skin-care products at the global level, in partnership with the main national and international brands and
retailers active in the cosmetics, skincare, hair and body care sectors.

For over 40 years, Intercos has been interpreting beauty by designing and creating cosmetic products and
positioning itself as a trendsetter able to predict, anticipate and influence make-up trends.

The Group's mission is “to be the preferred partner of all cosmetic brands. To offer the most innovative and
creative products with a competitive mindset and the fastest time to market”. Thanks to its continuous search
for innovation in the selection and ideation of raw materials, the creation of products’ formulas, and the
development of new technologies and packaging, Intercos is able to renew itself and to design and supply
innovative products, determining its role as a strategic partner and full outsourcer. Thus, Intercos aims “to
anticipate the future of beauty with a visionary approach, an agile attitude and a commitment to simplicity”.
Intercos owes its success to a number of peculiar strength points, namely:

Ability to create new products and to anticipate consumer trends and demands

Research and Innovation are an essential component of Intercos’ business model, as well as an area in which
the Group invests considerable resources. It is indeed thanks to the intense activities in Research and
Development that the Group succeeds in continuously improving and expanding its product portfolio and
making the entire production process more efficient. The deep knowledge of consumers, in addition to
products, allows Intercos to qualify as a trendsetter in the world of beauty, to create and offer its customers
innovative products that to anticipate trends and become immediately trendy.

Una piattaforma produttiva globale, strutturata ed efficiente

Its global production platform allows Intercos to organize production efficiently, to respond to peaks in demand
and leverage economies of scale, as well to consolidate its presence in emerging markets. The geographical
proximity to its customers also allows Intercos to capture and rapidly respond to their needs.

The required managerial skills and the costs needed to manage the complexities of a production platform such
as that of the Intercos Group constitute a barrier to entry for both global and local competitors wishing to grow
within the beauty outsourcing market. These complexities also derive from the breadth of Intercos’ product
portfolio, based on a variety of different technologies and production processes.

Positioning as an industry leader in the reference market

Intercos holds a leading position in the "B2B" segment of the beauty market, highlighting the Group's ability to
present itself as a strategic partner to its customers. Intercos is indeed able to operate as a full outsourcer and
manage internally the entire value chain, from trend scouting to research, from the selection of suppliers to the
production and marketing of its products.

Moreover, the constant focus on innovation, supported by Intercos’ deep knowledge of the market and
distribution channels, allows the Group to adapt to the changing needs of consumers, thus anticipating and
actively influencing trends.

Intercos holds the intellectual property of most of the formulas / products and production processes, which in
some cases can be hardly replicated by customers or competitors. Consequently, Intercos is able to retain its
customers and consolidate its commercial relationships, lasting sometimes over twenty years, with most of the
major operators of the cosmetic industry.
