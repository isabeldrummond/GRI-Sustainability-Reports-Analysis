Procurement and disposal processes

In conducting its business, Intercos Group manages thousands of raw materials and semi-finished
products that come from different parts of the world and are extracted, processed and produced in
territories that are characterized by more or less relevant environmental pressures, depending on the
country of origin / processing. For this reason, the procurement of raw materials and other product
components, such as packaging materials and labels, as well as their management, transformation into
finished products and possible disposal are an element of fundamental importance for the Group.

The procurement of raw materials
Raw materials selection and codification processes apply, at the Group level, to both the raw materials

purchased by the Company and those specifically requested by the customer and sent to contractors.
Following the receipt of a purchase request for a specific raw material, the Raw Material Office evaluates
the possible suppliers and requests a sample that must be accompanied by a set of documentation of
various type including, in addition to the technical and toxicological documentation, the declaration of
REACH compliance, MSDS and RSPO certification (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) where
applicable. Following the verification of the documentation, the Raw Material Office sends the raw material
to the laboratory for possible tests and finally, after its approval, it activates the codification process by
entering the specific information of the raw material in the company database.

Proving its commitment to guaranteeing the respect for the environment, Intercos has adopted a Group-
wide selection and qualification process for new suppliers which is also based on environmental criteria
and which aims at evaluating how suppliers commit to manage and monitor environmental issues.

La gestione delle sostanze chimiche pericolose
Intercos Europe S.p.A. has adopted a specific procedure for the management of chemicals that are

potentially dangerous for the environment, which is mainly based on the provisions of the European
Regulations 1907/2006 (REACH), 1272/2008 (CLP) and 2015/830 (SDS).

The introduction of chemical agents into the plant can take place either through the purchase of chemicals
used for bulk production, or through the purchase of substances and semi-processed products, generally
ancillary products, mainly used for maintenance activities or by the technical services. Regarding the
chemical substances used for production, the Research Department selects the raw materials that are
then validated by the HSE function and codified by the Coding Department. The latter requires the supplier
to update the safety data sheets in Italian in order to file them and ensure the compliance of the papers
received with respect to the REACH regulation. Following the issuing of purchasing order by the
Purchasing Office and the arrival of the products in stock, the HSE function defines the responsibilities of
the functions in charge of the verification and management of the processes from the arrival to the storage
and the handling of the chemical agents.

For what concerns the management of auxiliary products, based on the specific department's need, the
managers contact the supplier and requests the respective safety data sheets. The HSE function examines
the safety data sheets and involves, as appropriate, one or more functions for final approval. The managers
of the different departments finally supply the approved products, even without the involvement of the
Purchasing Department. Following the arrival of the products in the warehouse, the logistics function
delivers it to production.

Waste collection and disposal
To date, there is no centralized model for managing waste collection and disposal, which are delegated to

the individual local units, mainly at the production sites, according to practices or procedures that are in
line with applicable laws and / or the regulations in the different countries.

Intercos Europe S.p.A. has adopted a specific waste management procedure which is mainly based on
the provisions of the European and Italian legislation (D.Lgs.152 / 2006 as amended).
