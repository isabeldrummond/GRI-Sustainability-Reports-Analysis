Description of the risk

malfunctions or breakages in the
treatment systems.

Specific production activities (for
example manual handling of
heavy loads, exposure to
potentially dangerous chemicals)
may impact on employees’ health
and safety.

The different human rights laws in
force in the countries where
Intercos operates could challenge
Intercos’ ability to verify that the
Group’s standards are equally
respected by all companies and
suppliers.

The presence of two activities,
mica extraction and the
metallization process, present a
high risk of violation of human
and labor' rights along the supply
chain.

Because of its B2B business
model, Intercos cannot leverage
the visibility of its brand, which, as
it is not directly exposed to the
end customer and potential
collaborators, might be
considered not too attractive. For
this reason, Intercos finds some
difficulties in attracting qualified
resources.

The use of materials/ingredients
constrained by norms and
legislations and regulated at the
European and international level.

The use of materials/ingredients
constrained by the customer at
