The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil

Palm oil is a vegetable oil that, as such or as a derivative obtained by reaction or by extraction of certain
components, is used in the cosmetic sector for the production of foaming surfactants. It can be found in
particular in cleaning products, from soaps to shower gels, in almost all types of emulsions, such as
creams and cleansing milks, from shaving to make-up products, from lipsticks to pencils.

In the last thirty years the cultivation of palm oil has grown, mainly in Southeast Asia, where it is
considered, together with the wood industry, the main cause of the intense deforestation phenomenon.
The conversion of tropical forests into vast oil palm monocultures causes the disappearance of precious
rain forests, the deterioration of peatlands, the suppression of unique natural ecosystems and,
consequently, the loss of biodiversity. Moreover, not only do the strong changes in land use cause erosion
and hydrogeological instability in the territories concerned, but they also produce a strong increase of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thus contributing to climate change globally.

To contribute to combating land and forest exploitation and to prevent the potential risk of being indirectly
involved in deforestation activities, in 2017 Intercos joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
(RSPO). The RSPO, a non-profit association, has defined specific environmental and social criteria that
member companies must respect to produce and market certified sustainable palm oil, with the aim of
developing an international standard for sustainable use of palm oil.

During 2019, the Intercos Group reached the 69% share of RSPO certified suppliers. Furthermore,
starting from 2020, the subscription of the Group as an Ordinary Member of the RSPO association leads
to a renewed commitment towards the sourced palm oil traceability through a specific Annual
Communication on Progress (ACOP).

The main goals of the RSPO association are:

1. to implement research and development activities to define criteria for sustainable palm oil use
and production;

2. to undertake projects aimed at facilitating the implementation of best sustainable practices;

3. to develop concrete solutions to the problems encountered in the adoption and assessment of
best practices for the creation and management of plantations, procurement, trade and
logistics;

4. to acquire financial resources from private and public funds to finance projects supervised by
the RSPO;

5. to communicate the RSPO's work to all stakeholders and to the general public.
