In Italy, France and Switzerland, for all managers, the company has developed a training path in
partnership with an external provider specialized in coaching and counseling for companies. The path is
composed by two distinct training programs: “Lead” and “Adventure Time”. Since 2016, the Lead program
has accompanied managers on their development path, providing meetings that address essential issues
such as leadership and team working for a total training period that can vary between 15 and 18 months.
Once completed the Lead program, managers’ coaching goes on with Adventure Time: the program aims
to reinforcing the skills acquired through different paths focused on emotional intelligence and the relation
with others.

Furthermore, for each training course, the manager of each course carries out a formal assessment in
order to test their effectiveness and highlight potential improvement areas.

Performance evaluation

Also with a view to developing their competencies and professionalism, most employees receive a formal
performance evaluation with the aim of identifying improvement areas and / or evaluating, with the support
of their manager, opportunities for horizontal (cross-functional) or vertical career growth. This process is
managed centrally, through a specific IT system, but implemented by the various subsidiaries of the Group
through local practices or procedures.

The company welfare

In order to promote a happy and healthy working environment, Intercos promotes specific welfare
programs through which it offers services that balance working and private life to its employees, with a
