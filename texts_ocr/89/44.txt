4.2 Relevant risks in the area of corruption
[GRI 102-15], [GRI 205-1], [GRI 205-3]

Further to the details provided in the previous section, with reference to the internal regulations adopted
to tackle corruption and comply with the relevant external regulations, the main Group companies
perform an annual assessment of the risk of non-compliance with the regulations, which includes the
regulations instituted in order to tackle corruption, active and passive.

This risk assessment activity takes the following factors into consideration: the risk of potential breach
(taking into account the probability of occurrence in the absence of measures, the seriousness of the
sanctions for such breaches, and the potential impact in reputational terms); the existing mitigation
measures in place; and the degree of compliance noted in the existing conduct. Following the assessment
process, the residual risk of non-compliance can be identified, based on which a decision as to whether
or not to institute controls or mitigation measures can be taken. The assessments carried out have not
revealed material residual risks in the corruption area, in view of the measures put in place (as described
in the previous section) and the checks carried out. In the year under review, the risk assessment process
involved 42 of the Group companies’ business lines (roughly 88% of the total).

The Group Audit Unit performs audits of the various legal entities which also include checks on the risk
of corruption. Such checks include: correct application of the accounting procedures and transfers of
funds to suppliers, transparency in relations with the public administration, compliance with powers
of representation delegated to staff and with the internal regulations on expense refund claims. Also
part of the audit activities are checks which impact on the risk of corruption indirectly, such as those on
transactions on financial markets and the nature of counterparties.

The audits performed by the control functions revealed no instances of corruption.
