The Group considers the promotion of health and safety as one of the priorities of its way of doing business.
For this reason it is committed to achieving, maintaining and complying with the requirements set in
this area as defined in the applicable regulations in force in the countries where Mediobanca operates,
adopting an approach which is based on continuous improvement.

To this end, the Group has implemented an effective security management system which is co-ordinated
and managed by a Safety Committee, made up by the head of the Prevention and Protection unit, an
external Company Doctor (CD), a Group Safety Manager internal to the organization, and an employees’
security representative (ESR).

The unit regulates and monitors security activities for the company, embeds the principles governing
the regulatory obligations, and standardizes the means of involving staff members and the Group units
involved. The creation of synergies between the various companies allows costs to be kept down and
provides for increased efficiency in the management of health and safety in the workplace.

The Safety Committee is responsible for ensuring a secure working environment which is compliant with
the regulations in force, such as Italian Legislative Decree 81/08, for defining the Group's guidelines in
the area of health and safety, for co-ordinating monitoring activities, and, where necessary, for improving
safety conditions. The Committee's prevention and protection service covers virtually all staff included in
the scope of operations defined by the regulations in force”.

In drawing up the relevant Risk Assessment Document, the Group has identified the following main risks:
risks related to the presence of electrical equipment and devises, use of video terminals, work-related
stress, and in the retail area in particular, risk of armed robbery.

Furthermore, as provided by Italian Legislative Decree 81/08, the workers’ security representatives
appointed at the various Group companies take part in specific activities such as security meetings,
inspections and preparing documents, in addition to representing the workers themselves during trade
union meetings. All staff employed by the Italian Group companies may be considered as being represented
at the stage of finalizing the formal agreements.
