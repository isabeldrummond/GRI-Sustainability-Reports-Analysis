In FY 2019-20 the product governance policies for banking and insurance products were revised
further.

Mediobanca Private Banking is constantly committed to guaranteeing the maximum transparency
for the services it provides and the activities it performs versus clients, management and the
authorities, whilst maintaining its obligations in the area of confidentiality and compliance with the
regulations. Within the division, communication with clients is guaranteed by the close and ongoing
relationship which customers have with their bankers, as well as by the official communications
which Mediobanca, as required by law, sends regularly to them.

Financial inclusion, access to financial resources and education

The Group has always been keen to promote and develop the financial awareness of its clients.
For this reason it has promoted a model of financial education based on sharing information on
products and services expressed in clear, simple terms.

Compass’s contribution to financial inclusion and accessibility takes the form primarily of
various commercial communication initiatives in languages other than Italian. The company’s
website includes different sections in English, Spanish, Filipino and Romanian.
With a view to attracting younger customers with its product offering, in 2020 Compass
launched Pagolight, a buy now, pay later product. This purchasing model is gaining ground
in many countries around the world, allowing customers to pay for items in small monthly
amounts with no extra cost, thus replicating the type of purchase experience available online
in the store itself. PagoLight allows the item to be paid for in small monthly amounts debited
to the client’s credit card free of charge, at no extra cost.
Clients with an ISEE (equivalent financial situation indicator) of less than €11,600 who apply for
finance are offered basic current accounts for poorer customers. This account guarantees
favourable treatment for customers, e.g. no charges for opening or closing the account, no
stamp duty, etc.
CheBanca! and Compass have also adopted the practice of suspending repayments on
mortgages and personal loans for customers who have been involved in flooding, earthquakes
and other natural catastrophes*®.

CheBanca! has always promoted and developed a product and service offering that gives it
access to existing and potential clients who want their financial needs to be met. As permitted
by law, this possibility is also offered to clients who have disabilities, who are subject to support
and protection measures, who are visually impaired and/or otherwise unable to sign for
physical reasons.

In order to embed and increase its clients’ level of financial awareness, the bank organizes
events on issues relating to finance, including in prestigious cultural locations. To involve the
broadest audience possible in understanding the markets and the principal financial events,
CheBanca, with the support of Mediobanca SGR, also publishes a quarterly report (Your Advice)
which is sent in electronic format to all the bank’s investors.
