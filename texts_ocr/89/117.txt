2017 in the Milanese suburb of Quarto Oggiaro, has subsequently extended to the Via Padova area
and Baggio areas.

The sports activities themselves (rugby, volleyball and athletics in particular) will be assisted by the
presence of a psychologist to provide support in cases involving the most difficult family situations.
Several volunteers from the Group also took part in the activities on the pitch.

Even though training sessions were suspended during the lockdown period, some volunteers from
CUS Milano were out distributing food parcels to people in financial difficulty, the elderly, disabled
and those suffering from immune disorders, also with the co-operation of Mediobanca staff members.
To help families in caring for their children during the summer period, CUS Milano took part in the
Summer School run by the Milan municipal council, providing recreational and educational activities.
The Group has also financed the refurbishment of the sports facilities most in need of upgrade in the
areas involved, and has renewed its support for the 2020-23 three-year period.

© Italian Paralympic Committee: since 2016 the Mediobanca Group has been partner to the IPC with
the objective of supporting and embedding the values of Paralympic sport as a vehicle for social
integration, a sphere which affirms a genuine culture of merit and promotes genuinely open and fair
competition;

© Mediobanca Group Sport Camp: a multi-sport camp developed in conjunction with the Milan City
Council and run at the “Cesare Beccaria” Institute in Milan to give young offenders an opportunity to
spend a week playing sport in a healthy environment which promotes competition, respect for the
rules and fair play. The project has also involved improvement of the facilities themselves, with the
installation of rugby posts and new goal posts for football. This year, the camp has been run for the
fourth time at the start of September, once again with the direct involvement of some of our own staff
participating in the activities and assisting the Camp staff in the course of the week.

Those in prison have also been included thanks to the following initiative:

© The Prisoners Ask Why: the project promoted by Mediobanca and the non-profit organization L'Arte
di vivere con Lentezza with the co-operation of the Kasa dei Libri, engages with the prison world with
the objective of promoting social inclusion through reading. Several major Italian writers took part in
the event in the first two years it was run, answering the questions asked by the inmates at a series
of meetings held at the prisons which participated in the initiative. The project was scheduled to run
for the third time in the spring of 2020, but owing to Covid-19 has been postponed until the autumn,
seeing as the writers and volunteers were not able to enter the prisons at the time.

On the back of their ongoing focus on young people at risk of social exclusion, Mediobanca and CheBanca!
have entered into a three-year partnership with Associazione Cometa to run a project under the name of
Accademia del Legno (the “Academy of Woodworking”), now in its third year of activity, an organization to
be run according to a social business model which facilitates the inclusion of young people coming from
situations of social, economic and personal difficulties in the workplace, with the objective of becoming
a sustainable and self-standing business, which develops services and products of excellence in the
furnishing and interior décor sector. There are therefore two sides to the Academy: on the one hand it
focuses on training, which is essential for the growth and future career of the students enrolled in the
“Oliver Twist” school run by Cometa; while on the other, it functions as a genuine, artisanal start-up
venture, manufacturing products of high value in quality terms to be marketed in Italy and exported to
international markets. The project has been confimed for the coming year.
