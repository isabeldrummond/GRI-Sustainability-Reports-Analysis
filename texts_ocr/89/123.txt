[GRI 103-3], [GRI 307-1]

The Mediobanca Group is committed to limiting the impact on the environment generated by its
operations, through:

© Ongoing monitoring and improvement of environmental efficiency, with reference in particular to the
consumption of resources;

© Developing initiatives to improve energy management, including by sourcing energy from renewable
sources and through the use of innovative, lower-impact technologies and solutions;

Rationalization of use of resources (e.g. electricity, paper and water);
Improvement in waste management by using sustainable disposal methods where possible;

Maintenance of properties and equipment so as to progressively improve environmental performances;

Prior assessment of the environmental impact of the new processes, new systems/equipment, and
structural and organizational changes

During the reporting period no significant sanctions were received for failing to comply with environmental
laws or regulations.

COVID-19 EMERGENCY

The spread of the Covid-19 pandemic also affected the Group’s environmental performances.
The reduction in working hours at branch offices, the number of people working from home,
and the increase in services provided remotely, all entailed reductions in the consumption of
paper and water and in the amount of waste generated. The greatest impact was in terms of
business travel, which was suspended during the months of lockdown and strongly reduced
even in the months that followed, resulting in Scope 3 emissions*® declining steeply.

[GRI 3021], [GRI 302-2], [GRI 302-3], [GRI 302-4], [GRI 305-1], [GRI 305-2], [GRI 305-3], [GRI 305-4], [GRI 305-5],
[GRI 305-6], [GRI 305-7]

The Group’s energy consumption is linked primarily to its use of heating and air-conditioning systems, the
functioning of its data centre and server rooms, and to office lighting systems.
