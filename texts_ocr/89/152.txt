Auditor’s responsibilities

Weare responsible for expressing a conclusion, on the basis of the work performed, regarding the
compliance of the NFS with the Decree and with the GRI Standards. We conducted our engagement in
accordance with “International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) —
Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”
(hereafter “ISAE 3000 Revised”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards
Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and apply
procedures in order to obtain limited assurance that the NFS is free of material misstatement. The
procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in scope than those performed in a
reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised (“reasonable assurance
engagement”) and, therefore, do not provide us with a sufficient level of assurance that we have
become aware of all significant facts and circumstances that might be identified in a reasonable
assurance engagement.

The procedures performed on the NFS were based on our professional judgement and consisted in
interviews, primarily with company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information
presented in the NFS, analysis of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to obtain
evidence considered useful.

In particular, we performed the following procedures:

1. analysis of the relevant matters reported in the NFS relating to the activities and
characteristics of the Group, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process
used, in accordance with article 3 of the Decree and with the reporting standards adopted;

2. analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area, in order to
assess their compliance with the Decree;

3. comparison of the financial information reported in the NFS with that reported in the
Mediobanca Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements;

4. understanding of the following matters:

— business and organisational model of the Group, with reference to the management of the
matters specified by article 3 of the Decree;

— policies adopted by the Group with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the
Decree, actual results and related key performance indicators;

— main risks, generated and/or faced by the Group, with reference to the matters specified
in article 3 of the Decree.

With reference to those matters, we compared the information obtained with the information
presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described under point 5 a) below;

5: understanding of the processes underlying the preparation, collection and management of the
significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the NFS. In particular, we held
meetings and interviews with the management of Mediobanca SpA, Compass SpA and Cairn
Capital Ltd and we performed limited analysis of documentary evidence, to gather information
about the processes and procedures for the collection, consolidation, processing and
submission of the non-financial information to the function responsible for the preparation of
the NFS.
