All A4 paper consumed for office purposes is FSCcertified, and part of the paper consumption
for commercial purposes uses recycled paper. The reduction in paper consumption in FY 2019-20
is primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as to digitalization initiatives, such as the one
implemented for IPOs by the London branch office which has digitalized the procedure.

During the financial year, the data on waste collected in Italy refers chiefly to toner, quantified
at approximately 8.36 tons, slightly higher than the figure reported last year®*. There was also a
reduction in the amount of non-dangerous waste produced, attributable to Covid-19 but also the
awareness-raising campaigns undertaken.

62. This brand distinguishes products and services with reduced environmental impact throughout their lifecycle, thus helping to protect the environment by reducing
the quantity of waste and pollution, energy and water consumption, and reducing or eliminating the use of dangerous chemical substances

63. For paper consumption, estimates have been used where data for recent months is unavailable, basing the estimates on the consumption figures recorded in the
months prior to that

64, The increase in the consumption of toner against a reduction in the amount of paper used is due to the fact that the reporting is based on toner acquired rather
than actually used
