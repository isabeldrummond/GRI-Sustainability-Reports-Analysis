7.2.2 Culture, research and innovation

The Mediobanca Group’s commitment to culture and research bears out our awareness of the responsibility
which our company has on a civic and social level as well, in the knowledge that our role is bigger than
merely the pursuit of economic gain. From as early as the years following its inception, Mediobanca has
promoted important publishing initiatives, and has been committed to valorizing its architectural and
archival heritage. Equally important is the attention we devote to scientific and economic research which
is a core feature of the Group's identity.

In this area the following activities should be noted:

© MB Research Area: this comprises the Mediobanca Research Department and Group company Ricerche
e Studi — R&S, which have been operative since 1946 and 1970 respectively. The area is a centre which
specializes in economic and financial analysis and research, with a focus on manufacturing enterprise
and the industrial economy, issues to which Mediobanca has always ascribed substantial importance,
including in connection with its own core business. The area has its own database input with the
results of individual restatements of balance-sheet acquired exclusively from official and primary
sources. Having proprietary data available has enabled the area to construct coherent and consistent
historical series, some of which date back to the early 1970s in the case of company data and to the
1930s for the stock market figures.
Much of the data thus processed is available free of charge at the area’s website (www.mbres.it) which
last year was visited by over 43,000 users (stable, up 0.2% on the previous year), with nearly 55,000
downloads. Engagement activity included media presentations and taking part in events promoted
mainly by universities and institutional entities, with around 400 citations on printed paper.
The outlay incurred by Mediobanca for the area’s activity, measured exclusively by giving-back
criteria, amounts to around €4.8m per year. The area also manages the Bank’s libraries of books and
documents.

© “Vincenzo Maranghi” Historical Archive: the objective of Mediobanca’s historical archive is to
preserve the Bank’s wealth of documents and make it accessible. It has been open to scholars since
November 2019 for consultation of documents for the period from the Bank’s foundation until 31
December 1966. In 2014 the Archive was given the status of being “of particularly important historical
interest”. To commemorate the Archive opening, its first volume of source materials was published,
namely a volume on the rescue of Olivetti in the 1960s (Mediobanca e il salvataggio Olivetti. Verbali delle
riunioni e documenti di lavoro, 1964-1966); the volume is available for download free of charge from the
Mediobanca website.

© Mediobanca Historical Library: set up in 2014, the Historical Library gives the public access to the
Bank’s holdings of rare and precious volumes on the history of Italian and international economic
analysis, collected over the years by Enrico Cuccia, Vincenzo Maranghi and Ariberto Mignoli. The
collection holds over 12,000 volumes.

© Istituto Europeo di Oncologia: the IEO was founded in Milan at the initiative of Mediobanca which is
a leading shareholder almost 25% of the share capital. The IEO is the leading private comprehensive
cancer centre in Italy, combining clinical work with research. It also owns the Istituto Monzino, the
leading specialist cardiology centre in Milan. The IEO-CCM Foundation, which supports the research
carried out by the Istituto Europeo di Oncologia and the Centro Cardiologico Monzino directly, has
provided over €24m to support research from 2000 to the present date. Each year the Foundation

 

awards grants to young researchers to carry out clinical and experimental research, to allow medical
