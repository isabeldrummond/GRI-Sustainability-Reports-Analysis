equipment and machinery to allow more lives to be saved and enable cancers and cardiovascular
illnesses to become easier to cure.

For several years now Mediobanca has also been supporting the work of various cultural organizations
such as: Civita, which works to promote and protect Italy’s cultural and environmental heritage; ISPI,
the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, which carries out research and analysis into the
risks and opportunities at world level for companies and institutions; and the Ugo La Malfa Foundation,
whose mission is to carry out analysis and research into issues and problems of economic importance and
national and international policy.

CheBanca! has always been aware of the talent represented by younger generations, and to this end has
launched a series of cultural partnerships which include the following:

© Milan Conservatory Orchestra: the bank’s support here has helped to create the Symphonic
Orchestra, to serve as a link between the world of education and the workplace. The Orchestra includes
Conservatory students among its number, who are asked to take part in all the scheduled productions
with the prospect of being directed in the concerts by internationally acclaimed directors;

© National Theatre of Milan: a prestigious institution in terms of its social and cultural value, the theatre
supports and stages shows, musical, concerts and a variety of other initiatives.

Outside Italy, Compagnie Monégasque de Banque has shown substantial commitment in the area of
culture, sponsoring a variety of local institutions over the years, such as the Grimaldi Forum, Monaco’s
leading cultural and tourist centre, hosting a wide range of shows and events.

In Switzerland, RAM Active Investments is involved in the RAM Active Philanthropy Foundation,
supporting numerous projects in the areas of medical and scientific research, including: the Italian MS

the CANSEARCH Foundation, which has created the first research platform specifically focused on
paediatric oncology-haematology, based in Geneva; and the ARTC - Association pour la Recherche sur
les Tumeurs Cérébrales, set up with the main goal to promote brain tumour research through fellowships
or scholarships to young researchers and through direct support of research projects at an early stage.
