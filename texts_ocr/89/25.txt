Under the terms of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors is appointed on the basis of a list
voting mechanism in which lists may be submitted by the Board of Directors and/or by shareholders
representing at least 1% of the company’s share capital in the aggregate.

The Directors must be in possession of the qualifications expressly set by the regulations in force and
the requisite time commitment; they must comply with the limits on the number of posts held, and not
be in any situations of incompatibility pursuant to Article 36 of Italian law 214/11. Three Directors are
chosen from among staff members who have been members of Group companies’ senior management
for at least three years. At least one-third of the Directors must qualify as independent according to the
definition provided in Article 19 of the Articles of Association, and no-one over the age of 75 may be
appointed. The Board’s composition also complies with the law on equal gender representation.

Mediobanca acknowledges and welcomes the benefits of diversity at Group level and also at the level of
its own governing bodies, in every aspect including gender, age, qualifications, competences, and training
and professional profile.

Mediobanca, in reiterating the importance of the Board’s collective suitability and hence of its members,
executive and non-executive, being collectively able to take informed decisions, has expressed the desire
that candidates for the position of director should have the required capabilities to be able to ensure an
optimal combination of profiles, so as to encourage the progression of internal debate, efficient functioning
and the overall suitability of the Board itself and its various committees.

The Board of Directors currently in office consists of 15 members — two of whom were appointed by
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 October 2018 following the resignation of two
of the Directors appointed at the AGM held on 28 October 2017 — one-third of whom are women, more
than half of whom qualify as independent under the definition provided in Article 19 of the Articles of
Association, and with two Directors appointed by minority investors. There are four executive and eleven
non-executive members on the Board.
