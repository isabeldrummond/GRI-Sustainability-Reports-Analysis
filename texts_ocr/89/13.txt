& 2. Strategy

The financial year under review was marked by the unprecedented shock caused by Covid-19 pandemic,
which besides major consequences in human and social terms brought the leading world economies to a
halt, forcing them into recession.

The Mediobanca Group’s integrated and diversified business model and its solidity and low risk profile
have been fundamental in dealing with a crisis which is without parallel in modern times.

The Group's solid and effective technology platform has enabled Mediobanca to adapt seamlessly working
from home, meaning its staff can remain safe with no interruptions to the service offered to clients, which
continue to be provided both through branch offices and via remote channels.

In terms of financial performance, despite the emergency situation the Mediobanca Group posted solid
results for FY 2019-20: revenues stable at €2.5bn (up 3% net of one-off Covid-related items), a net profit of
€600m, lower than the €823m posted last year chiefly relating to a series of non-recurring items totalling
approx. €285m, roughly 80% of which were due to Covid-19. Net of these items, consolidated net profit
totalled €887m, with earnings per share up 3%.

At divisional level there was significant progress made by Wealth Management and further consolidation in
Consumer Banking; while the contributions of the Corporate & Investment Banking and Principal Investing
divisions remained high and positive.

The twelve months under review also saw the presentation of the Group's new 2019-23 Strategic Plan, which
for the first time included certain quantitative sustainability targets, with the intention of contributing to six of
the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations.

The Group's participation in the Global Compact and the Principles for Responsible Investment promoted
by the United Nations is further confirmation of its commitment to generating positive change at global level.

In line with the commitments entered into in the Strategic Plan, the Group has adopted a strategy focused
on sustainable growth over time, valorizing its staff, sensitivity to the societies in which it operates, and
reduction of direct and indirect impact on the environment.

To govern the Group’s efforts to deliver responsible growth, the Board of Directors has set up its own
Corporate Social Responsibility Committee, with responsibilities for processing sustainability issues.

Mediobanca’s corporate social responsibility has been further strengthened with the new Group
Sustainability Policy governing direct social and environmental impacts, and the Policy on Responsible
Lending and Investing, recently adopted, governing indirect impacts, and outlining the general principles
and guidelines for assessment of ESG (Environmental, Social e Governance) factors in lending, investment
and advisory activities.
