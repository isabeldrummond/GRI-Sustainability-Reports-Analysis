No instances of fatalities have been reported, either among employees or external collaborators, and no
cases of professional illness have been recorded, either. The absenteeism rate among staff was 2,33%7’,
slightly lower than last year, 1.62% of which referred to men and 3.30% to women.

The Group, despite not performing high-risk activities, adopts a preventative approach to its operations
which involves carrying out regular checks of its premises, arranging meetings on health and safety
with the various internal stakeholders, putting on training courses and implementing communications
programmes and awareness-raising activities.

Other major initiatives were carried out during the year, such as: refresher course on the five-year plan for
workers and heads of safety appointed under Italian Legislative Decree 81/08; completion of the training
programme for new recruits, and refresher courses on health and safety for staff members. The training
sessions scheduled for the period from February to June 2020 had to be suspended due to the Covid-19
crisis; they will resume as soon as the situation has normalized.

In FY 2019-20, in addition to the compulsory training on health and safety issues, a total of 1,748 hours’
training was provided in the Covid-19 course, addressed to 3,497 staff members.

HEALTH AND SAFETY DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS

The Group promptly activated all health and safety protocols to protect its own staff. Management
of Phase 1 (lockdown) allowed the branch offices to continue providing services, by acquiring
protective materials and making the agencies themselves safe.

Phase 2 saw staff gradually return to work by facilitating the following initiatives:

© Acquisition of protective material (face masks, hand gel, etc,);

© Use of Plexiglas in the CheBanca! and Compass to allow staff to work safely;

25. This indicator represents the impact of accidents in the workplace which results in the worker who had the accident being absent from work. It is derived from the
number of days’ work lost due to accidents, divided by the total number of hours worked, and multiplied by 1,000

26. This indicator represents the frequency of accidents in relation to the total number of hours worked by the entire workforce in the reporting period. It is derived
from the number of accidents divided by the total number of hours worked, and multiplied by 1,000,000
