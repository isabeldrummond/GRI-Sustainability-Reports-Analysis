Mediobanca SGR has adopted its own Policy on Responsible Investing (ESG) based on the
conviction of the need to embrace environmental, social and governance principles in its investment
process. In line with the parent company’s sustainability strategy, Mediobanca SGR promotes ESG
practices in its asset management and advisory activities. In September 2019 Mediobanca SGR
confirmed its commitment to more responsible and sustainable finance by adhering to the United
Nations’ the Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI).

Cairn Capital is committed to implementing responsible investment principles, based on the
conviction that ESG issues can be a major factor in terms of risk and financial performance, with
the objective of meeting the evolving sustainability preferences of clients and investors. Cairn
Capital recognizes that the identification and management of ESG issues are fundamental to the
long-term success of companies. For this reason, it has adopted an ESG Policy based on top-down
negative screening, i.e. excluding companies operating in certain sectors, combined with a bottom-
up approach assessing investments against specific ESG criteria for each asset class. Cairn Capital
Group too has signed up the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).

RAM Active Investments too pursues a responsible investing strategy. To this end it has adopted
a Policy on Responsible Investing defining the guidelines for incorporating environmental, social
and governance factors into the investing processes and strategies, both for equities and debt.
RAM has also adopted a Climate Change Policy, with the objective of tackling climate risks through
investment decisions or direct involvement and/or collaborations.

The Mediobanca Group has also chosen to develop a sustainable and responsible approach to
investment by featuring ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) products in its offering. The
ESG criteria pursued by Mediobanca are respectful of the environment, Human Rights and good
corporate governance practices.

The debt market too has evolved towards ESG products, in particular in support of the environment,
incorporating the principal EU directives that serve to implement a Green Deal at EU level. The
recent agreement on the European Recovery Fund, which allocates part of the funds to responsible
investment projects and to address climate change, is also significant.

The drive towards new ESG issues involved the bond market first of all, which is more standardized
and consists largely of pension fund and institutions, whose needs are primarily for fixed-income
returns.

However, starting from 2019-20, the ESG type has made swift progress in the loan component as
well, compensating for the temporary slowdown in the bond segment due to the volatility linked to
Covid-19 during 1Q 2020.

Initially the prerogative of government entities or companies in the utility sector with high ratings,
the ESG label has widened recently to comprise corporates in the telecoms, real estate and financial
sectors, including senior and subordinated notes and also, more recently, leveraged finance deals.
Mediobanca has acted swiftly to extend its reach by adapting to these new market trends by:
