© Making its debut on the ESG funding market, with the issue of the first Mediobanca Green
Bond (September 2020). Green, social and sustainable issues are a funding channel that
cannot be ignored. Being able to issue ESG instruments diversifies the Group's funding sources
even further, enabling an improved capability to refinance the Bank’s green portfolio, in full
alignment with the 2019-23 Strategic Plan;

© Providing advisory services to our clients on market deals which involve the issue of ESG
financial instruments. The Bank has played a leading role in the Italian market opening
up to green bonds, managing the inaugural issue by Hera in 2014, followed by other roles as
Joint Bookrunner in issues of senior green/ESG bonds made by leading Italian companies
(including traditional utilities such as A2A, Iren, Terna, Snam and Enel, and also green companies
such as green come Erg), of subordinated green bonds (Assicurazioni Generali and EDP), and
the social housing bond issued by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. The most recent example of this
was the role taken by Mediobanca in our own first green bond issue as Sole Green and
Sustainable Structuring Advisor;

© Engaging in sustained ESG lending activity to both corporate and retail clients. On the loan
market, Mediobanca has acted as Lead Arranger for a package of green loans for Italo
NV. and for variuos ESG credit lines to domestic corporates (Terna, Snam, A2A) and
international counterparties (including Enagas, Telefonica, Merlin, Cellnex and Eiffarie). The
Bank’s commitment to responsible lending in the retail area is shown by the Consumer
Banking division (personal loans to improve the energy efficiency of properties and purchase
hybrid and electric vehicles) and CheBanca! (green mortgages to acquire and refurbish energy
class A or B properties).

Some 30% of Mediobanca’s marketing activities to clients now involves debt activities for ESG
purposes (bonds and loans), with the intention being to step up commercial efforts in this direction
still further, as the medium-term trends favour the growth of this sector.

In particular:

© ESG instruments have outperformed traditional assets, due to long-term investors less
exposed to short-term price fluctuations. Similarly, the financial terms of the new ESG bonds
tend to benefit from having a wider investor base and a structural lack of investment
instruments, whereas for loans the interest rates are more favourable to reaching the targets
set for the issue;

© The creation of benchmark indexes focused on the ESG segment intensifies the demand for
securities from investors, who increasingly paying closer attention to social trends such as
portfolio allocation criteria;

© The ratings agencies, pending finalization of specific ESG ratings, already incorporate an ESG
assessment in their analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the companies;

© On 9 March 2020, the European Union defined a transparent, uniform Green Bond Standard,
which included the introduction of transition instruments;

© The EBA recommendations, in force from July 2021, will force banks to assess the ESG risk
posed by their lending assets.
