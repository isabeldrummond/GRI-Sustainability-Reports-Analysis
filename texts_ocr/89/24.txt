3.2 Governance model
[GRI 102-18], [GRI 102-22], [GRI 102-24], [GR! 405-1]

Mediobanca has adopted a traditional system of governance based on the appointment of a Board of
Directors and Statutory Audit Committee by shareholders gathered in annual general meeting.

Within this model, the Group’s governance provides for a clear division of roles and responsibilities between
governing bodies, as stipulated in the Articles of Association:

© The Board of Directors is responsible for strategic supervision, approving the strategic direction of the
Bank and monitoring to ensure it is implemented in practice;

© Management of the Group is the responsibility of the Executive Committee and the Chief Executive
Officer, who are responsible for executing the strategic direction and for managing the company’s
day-to-day operations;

© The Statutory Audit Committee is vested with duties of control.

The existing model works as follows:
