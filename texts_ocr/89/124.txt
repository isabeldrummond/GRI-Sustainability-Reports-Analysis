terms of a framework agreement whereby renewable electricity certified by a “Guarantee of Origin” is
acquired from CVA Energie.

Outside Italy, the London branch office, which already used electricity 100% from renewable sources,
since January 2020 has been joined by the Frankfurt, Paris and Madrid branch offices too. Compagnie
Monégasque de Banque has also attained EGEO certification stating that its electricity comes from
renewable sources and the e+ label for its sites.

The most significant emissions are due to the heating and conditioning systems, along with those linked
to company travel.

The Group monitors its own direct emissions, deriving from direct consumption of energy, i.e. natural gas
and diesel for heating and fuel for its company fleet management (Scope 1), indirect emissions deriving
from consumption of electricity acquired from third parties (Scope 2, Market-based and Location-based), and
transfers of its staff members and collaborators by train and by air (Scope 3).

The Mediobanca Group is committed to improving energy management, and to this end has carried out
various initiatives in FY 2019-20 in order to reduce consumption:

© Older systems replaced with others featuring VRV’° and obsolete boilers decommissioned. Replacement
of the diesel-fuelled boiler in Foro Buonaparte has enabled approx. 10,000 litres of diesel used in
heating to be saved, corresponding to approx. 27 tons of CO,;

© Human presence detection systems have been installed at the premises of MIS to regulate the use of
lighting in the toilet areas;

© Photocopiers are set to turn off automatically in order to save electricity;

© Equipment configured with power saving settings: around 3,000 VOIP telephones go into power saving
mode between the hours of 6.00 p.m. and 6.00 a.m., PC monitors after 5 minutes of being idle, laptops
after 15 minutes of being idle.

Energy monitoring systems have also been installed at the premises of Mediobanca (Via Filodrammatici),
Compass, CheBanca! and MIS.

In order to reduce its CO, emissions, the Group continues to promote initiatives to:

© Encourage the use of video-conference facilities, to reduce staff travel and emissions. Thanks to this
initiative, a total of some 2,000“ tons of CO, emissions were saved during the year under review;

© Increase the provision of training courses via e-learning methods;

© Reduce the use of individual means of transport, through provision of a company shuttle bus service
to the Milan Compass headquarters (from underground station Lotto to head office in Via Caldera), a
special deal with local transport provider ATM offering discounts on season tickets for CheBanca! staff,
and a bus shuttle service on order for MIS staff (Mediobanca MlSposto);

40. Variable Refrigerant Flow
41. Since March 2020 there has been a reduction in emissions, due to the fact that during lockdown video-conferencing in the narrow sense was replaced by other
online meeting systems (e.g. Webex, Teams etc.)
