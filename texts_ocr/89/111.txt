7.1 Entities and Public Institutions
[GRI 102-12], [GRI 102-13]

The Group seeks to entertain constructive, ongoing and transparent relations with all its stakeholders,
including entities and public institutions.

Relations with the regulatory authorities, institutions and public entities are based on principles of proper
conduct and transparency, with respect to the different roles and excluding behaviour and attitudes which
seek to obtain improper and/or undue influence on conduct or which may even only appear to do so,
thereby frustrating every form of bribery and corruption.

Mediobanca does not make charitable donations to political movements or organizations, and personal
any involvement by staff in political organizations has no relation to the function performed by them
within the Group and is conducted in accordance with the provisions of the regulations in force.

Mediobanca is also registered in the Transparency register run by the European Commission, making
visible what interests are being pursued and giving the possibility to track the activities of lobbyists.

With reference to activities addressed to the community in the last financial year, the Group has worked
closely and from a position of trust with local and national entities and institutions to develop initiatives
and events in the cultural, artistic, social and sporting arenas. This commitment underlines the Group’s
desire to support our communities in positive fashion, not merely by the traditional means of making firms
more competitive but also through a serious and ongoing commitment to the priorities and needs of the
areas themselves, in which the Group offers the skills and resources typical of a financial institution to
support them in their growth.

Some of the main institutions which the Group partners and works with in the financial services area are
as follows:

© ABI - Italian Banking Association the association’s membership comprises directly or indirectly the
entire universe of Italian credit institutions and credit institutions operating in Italy, along with virtually
all of the financial intermediaries;

© ABI Lab: the research and innovation centre for banks promoted by ABI intended to create a hub for
banks and ICT and energy partners to meet and exchange ideas;

© AFME - Association for Financial Markets in Europe: the European association for financial
intermediaries operating in wholesale banking;
