The definition “Common objectives” means that all member countries and individuals are required to
contribute, combining forces on a collaborative basis and in partnership. Businesses too are therefore
required to play an activity role, as with their resources and capabilities they are able to have a fundamental
impact on the achievement of these global objectives.

The Mediobanca Group, aware of the close connection between some of the SDGs and its own business, is
keen to make its own contribution to making a positive change at the global level, focusing on projects and
activities which are more in line with the global objectives (see section 9. Objectives and future commitments).

The Group has also set sustainability targets for itself as part of its Strategic Plan*®, with the intention of
contributing to the achievement of six of the seventeen macro Sustainable Development Goals, and so
committing itself to help generate positive change at a global level.

The Group promotes and runs financial education and training via a
roe series of instruments and ventures for clients and vulnerable areas
(section 6.1.5, Financial inclusion, access to financial resources and education).
It also provides specialist training to its staff, helping them develop and
maintain their skills (section 5.5 Professional training and development).

In the Strategic Plan, the Group has set itself the objective of increasing the

 

hours of training for its staff (cf. section 9. Objectives and future commitments)

10. For details on the targets and state of progress made, see section 9, Objectives and future commitments
