8.4 Sourcing and consumption of sustainable products

The Mediobanca Group is aware of its impact on the environment, and is committed to responsible
management of its consumption of natural resources, seeking to reduce the amount of water it consumes,
promoting the use of recycled and/or FSC-certified paper, and gradually eliminating plastic from its premises.

8.4.1 Water consumption
[GRI 303-1], [GRI 306-1]

The Group, on account of the sector in which it operates, does not consume large amounts of water.
At the Group's premises, the main source of water consumption is the use of the toilet facilities.
To reduce water consumption, special aerators have been fitted to the taps to regulate the flow of

water.

of which from mains 99,462 107,511 90,928
of which from wells 95,188 116,890 179,922

All runoff water, equal to the number of litres of water consumed, is discharged into the public sewer
system.

54, Ratio between emissions and the total surface area of the Group's premises (squ. m)

55. Following the adjustment to the data on consumption of electricity and thermal energy and surface areas stated in the CNFS for FY 2019-20, it has been necessary
to adjust the energy intensity data as well

56. Following the adjustment to the data on consumption of electricity stated in the CNFS for FY 2018-19, it has been necessary to adjust the energy intensity data
as well

57. Ratio between emissions and the total surface area of the Group's premises (squ. m)

58. Following the adjustment to the data on consumption of electricity and thermal energy and surface areas stated in the CNFS for FY 2019-20, it has been necessary
to adjust the emissions intensity data as well

59. Following the adjustment to the data on consumption of electricity stated in the CNFS for FY 2018-19, it has been necessary to adjust the emissions intensity data
as well

60. For water consumption, where figures are not available estimates have been used: for shared building expenses of which the precise share cannot be calculated,
consumption has been estimated on the basis of the floor space in the building occupied. For bills still to be received, consumption has been estimated based on
the previous year’s figures. Consumption figures for the New York branch office (MB Securities), Messier Maris & Associés) and Cairn Capital Group Limited are not
monitored, as no data for the buildings in which they are housed is available)
