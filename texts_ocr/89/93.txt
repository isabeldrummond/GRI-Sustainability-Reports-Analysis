Responsible investing and sustainable products

In October 2019 the Board of Directors of Mediobanca approved the Group Policy on Responsible
Lending and Investing. The Policy is based on the conviction that environmental, social and
governance (ESG) principles are a key factor in pursuing the creation of value in earnings and
financial as well as social and environmental terms, hence the need to embrace them in the Group's
operating criteria as a matter of priority, to consolidate the trust shown by investors and markets.

The Policy applies to lending activities, investment of own funds and investment advisory services
provided to clients by the Mediobanca Group, and is based on a combination of:

© Negative screening through use of exclusion criteria, to identify companies involved in specific
activities which therefore cannot be taken into consideration for lending, investment and
advice processes;

© Positive screening based on precise inclusion criteria to identify companies that are committed
to ESG issues.

A series of other requisites have also been identified that have to be met, excluding from
consideration parties directly and significantly involved in the production and/or sale of weapons
that violate fundamental humanitarian principles (such as cluster bombs, anti-personnel mines,
nuclear, chemical or bacteriological weapons), and parties which have been convicted of Money-
laundering, Violation of Human Rights Holding, producing and/or spreading child pornography.

Indepth assessments are also carried out of counterparties and/or key issuers and/or companies
operating in sectors considered not to be responsible socially or with ESG ratings, and/or companies
with disputes pending deemed able to impact on reputational and risk-return profile.

Criteria are also applied in certain sectors considered to be at risk, namely: mining, nuclear energy,
defence and weapons, and electricity generated from coal.

The principles on which the Policy is based are the following: Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, the Principles for Responsible Investment and
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Mediobanca Private Banking implements checks and balances required in order to comply with
