In FY 2018-19, the Group Risk Management unit, in conjunction with the Operational Risk Management
unit, and with the support of the Group Sustainability unit, initiated a set of projects with the ultimate
objective of defining a risk assessment and reporting framework for ESG and climate change risks.

These projects continued in FY 2019-2020, with the objective of updating the methodology and outcomes
of the risk assessment and reporting processes, with a view to achieving ongoing improvement and
integration.

The projects have been structured into the following phases:

© Analysis of changes in the reference scenario, in order to identify the ESG and climate change risks
potentially impacted by changes to the regulations, by definition of the Group's 2019-23 Strategic
Plan, and by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic;

© Consolidation of the risk assessment methodology;

© Identification and assessment of emerging risks, update of the list of risks and their respective
mitigation actions, through one-to-one interviews, workshops and surveys with risk owners and
specialists at parent company level and at the principal Group companies;

© Consolidation of the risk assessment results, with evidence of how the risks are linked to sustainability
issues and objectives and also to the relevant SDGs’;

© Preparation of an integrated reporting flow to the Group Chief Risk Officer and Group Sustainability.

This activity has impacted materially on the Group's non-financial reporting, allowing information on risks
linked to the main issues, management models and tracking of the principal mitigation initiatives to be
included in the disclosure from FY 2018-19.

The various company areas being involved during the risk assessment phases has also helped to improve
the risk culture on ESG and climate-related issues, and has enabled the activities of managing, controlling
and monitoring risks and opportunities linked to such issues to be integrated into the responsibilities of
the three lines of defence.

During FY 2019-20 Mediobanca also launched projects to explore the impact of ESG and climate change
issues on the Group’s portfolio of loans and investments and on services provided to clients

The first project assessment phases concentrated on analysing the principal ESG risk factors to which
the proprietary portfolio (loans and investments) is exposed, and on identifying changes to the relevant
regulations on these issues that will come into force in the next few years. In the coming months the
assessment will be followed by activities to define and then implement policies, methodologies, rules and
responsibilities with a view to ensuring that ESG and climate change issues are increasingly integrated into
the Group’s core businesses.
