46. Electricity consumption figures have been restated from those published in the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement for FY 2018-19.

47. Where indirect energy consumption figures are not available estimates have been used: for shared building expenses of which the precise share cannot be
calculated, consumption has been estimated on the basis of the floor space in the building occupied. For bills still to be received, consumption has been estimated
based on the previous year’s figures.

48, FY 2017-18 and FY 2018-19 thermal energy has been reported on a prudential basis as non-renewable, as the supplier has not issued the required certification
to guarantee that exclusively non-renewable sources have been used. Starting from FY 2019-20 it has been possible to obtain information as to whether the
energy comes from renewable or non-renewable sources.
