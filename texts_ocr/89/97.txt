RAM Al has launched RAM Stable Climate Global Equities Fund, a fund set up with the aim of
addressing the climate emergency by offering investors an active strategy based on solid ESG
principles. This innovative approach to ESG issues is the result of indepth research carried out on
alternative data leveraging internal, cutting-edge technology capabilities. In view of the growing impact
which the climate emergency is having, RAM intends to provide investors with diversified proposals for
investments based on low carbon emissions based on a strategy that selects the best low-emission
companies without compromising on overall performance.

RAM has also set the objective of offsetting the fund’s already low carbon emissions (Scopes 1 and
2) by using CERs (carbon compensation certificates) in accordance with the provisions of the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM), at no extra cost for investors.

While many managers prefer a one-dimensional approach to managing climate change issues, simply
by reducing the weight of investments in the most heavily-polluting companies, RAM’s method aims
to leverage a myriad of different sources of ESG and non-ESG data to identify the best sustainable
investment opportunities in each sector.

In September 2015 RAM Al became a signatory to the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible
Investment (PRIs), and is also an active participant in the Non-Disclosure Campaign promoted by the
CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project). Since 2018 it has also supported the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD), whose main mission is to promote voluntary publication of financial
data linked to climate change, providing vital information to lenders, insurance companies, investors
and other shareholders.

6.1.7 Innovation, multi-channel approach and digitalization

The Mediobanca Group is aware that technology and digitalization are fundamental to be able to
offer an excellent service, has launched transformation of our IT structure, with the objective of
being able to meet the changes in the banking sector, regulatory and cyber-security requirements
most effectively, and ensuring the sustainability of the business in the long term.

This approach has been consolidated in an 2019-22 three-year plan, with strong modernizing
content, involving investments estimated at approx. €250m over four years (compared to the
approx. €170m spent in the previous three years), split 53% for strategic initiatives and 47% for
regulatory and “keep the bank” work.

The plan is structured around four strategic pillars:
© Digital Business and Automation

© Reduce fragmentation of operating systems by digitalizing them and making manual
and paper-based activities automatic (Business Process Automation);

© Apply operating technologies such as Al (chatbots etc.) to front and back office systems;
© Modernizing work stations (Digital Workplace)
© IT Evolution & Modernization

© Simplify the complexity of the applications portfolio and technological and organizational
fragmentation
