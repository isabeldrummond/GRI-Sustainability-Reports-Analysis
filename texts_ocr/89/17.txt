Mediobanca was founded in 1946 to support the reconstruction and development of the post-war Italian
economy. In the course of this activity, the Bank forged strong links with the most important industrial
families in Italy, promoting growth by taking equity investments in the companies itself. Although its
original mission was to large corporates, activities were soon launched in the retail and mid-corporate
segments too, with a view to diversification: with companies operating in consumer credit (Compass,
1960), leasing (Selma, 1970), mortgage lending (Micos, 1992) and private banking (Banca Esperia, 2001
and CMB, 2003).

Starting from 2003, the Bank embarked on a major transformation process, in a market and regulatory
scenario that required change to be accelerated in view of the financial crises that marked the last decade.
With the aim of strengthening its capital and earnings profile, and positioning itself as an operator geared
owards creating value in the long term, the Mediobanca thus transformed itself from a holding company
0 a banking group performing highly specialist activities. This led to more active management of the
equity investment portfolio, thus moving away from the system of cross-shareholdings, withdrawing from
he various shareholder agreements entered into and selling investments not considered to be strategic,
but also growing the banking activities in which the Bank had specialized, prioritizing capital light and
‘ee-generating businesses in particular.

he 2016-19 business plan accelerated this process further, with a Wealth Management division being set
up to leverage growth opportunities more effectively. Developing this division has become central to the
Group's growth strategies.

he Bank's solidity and stability, along with its ability to innovate, its professionalism and proper conduct,
care and respect for its clients and partners, are the values which have guided Mediobanca from its very
inception and have been the drivers of our recent solid and healthy growth.

Nn continuity with the previous business plan, the 2019-23 Strategic Plan intends to make the Group's
business model even more effective, with the aim of definitively establishing Mediobanca as a distinctive
player in the European financial panorama in terms of growth, quality and sustainability. The Group aims
0 achieve growth in all segments in which it operates, by leveraging on its distinctive features:

 

© Focus and positioning in highly specialized, highly profitable market segments driven by long-term
trends;

© Strong capital resources;

© Ongoing investment in talent, innovation and distribution.
