The Group devotes considerable attention to management of its remuneration policies, and is always
attentive of the need for compliance with the regulations issued by the authorities, and the Corporate
Governance Code in structuring remuneration packages and with reference to the means and
instruments by which its various components are paid. It also guarantees that all its staff members
are treated without distinction or exclusion inter alia with reference to remuneration, complementary
pension schemes and employee benefits. The remuneration policies are approved by shareholders each
year.

Remuneration packages are structured so as to:

© Balance the fixed and variable remuneration components over time (pay mix);
© Implement a flexible approach to remuneration;

© Help gear compensation towards performance in view of the significance of the role played within the
company without encouraging risky and/or short-term behaviour;

© Annual assessment of the staff compensation package's positioning relative to its reference market,
including with the assistance of outside advisors.

The ratio between basic salary and remuneration for men/women shows differences according to
seniority and role. In the last year there has been an improvement both in basic salary, especially in
the management segment, demonstrating the Group’s commitment to diversity in order to support
talented women in leadership positions. Among the employees, which is the largest segment in terms of
number of staff and the most balanced in terms of the ratio of men to women, the ratio is in fact above
100%, as the effect of the different seniority levels and role has less of an impact.

Furthermore, based on the awareness that corporate welfare makes a significant contribution to the
implementation of CSR, the Group has adopted instruments which produce positive effects outside the
company, benefiting not only staff members but also their family and the local community in general.

From this viewpoint and in line with the market, the remuneration package is complemented by a series
