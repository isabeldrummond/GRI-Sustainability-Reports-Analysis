3.3 Compliance, internal control and risk management
[GRI 102-11], [GRI 102-15]

The Mediobanca Group is distinguished by its prudent and selective approach to risk management, its
excellent asset quality and high capitalization levels which are comfortably above the minimum requisites
and among the highest of any Italian banks reported.

In order to manage the degree of uncertainty which is implicit in banking and financial activity, the Group
has adopted a series of rules, procedures and organizational structures with the objective of:

© Safeguarding the integrity of the Bank’s capital, to the direct benefit of its shareholders, clients and
employees.

© Supporting the formulation and implementation of the company’s strategies.
© Promoting the sustainable and enduring growth of the Bank and the return for its shareholders.
© Structuring effective and reliable company processes and procedures.

The Internal Control and Risk Management System (ICRMS) is the set of corporate rules, procedures and
functions, which, by structuring an adequate process for identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring
the principal risks, and the exchange of adequate reporting flows to guarantee that information circulates
appropriately, allows the business to be run soundly, properly, and in a way that is consistent with the
company’s objectives.

The ICRMS involves the management and control bodies and business units of Mediobanca S.p.A. and the
Mediobanca Group companies, with different roles and responsibilities, in order to pursue the objectives
of effectiveness and efficiency of processes, and to ensure the reliability and integrity of accounting and
management information. In addition to the control bodies and line management, the other principal
company units involved in the management and control of risks are as follows:

© Group Audit Unit: the Group Audit Unit operates on behalf of all the Group companies, and its mission
consists of assessing the Group's operations to check that they are being performed correctly and
monitoring changes in the company’s risks, reviewing the organizational structure and other internal
control system components to check that they are adequate, properly functioning and reliable,
and providing advice to the Group's various units, including through participation in project-based
activities. The unit performs its activities based on a plan drawn up using a risk-based approach; for it
to perform its duties, it has direct access to all useful information, and has adequate means available
to it. The head of the Group Audit Function, who reports directly to the Board of Directors, reports to
the governing bodies (Board of Directors, Risks Committee and Statutory Audit Committee) on the
results of its audit activities, has direct access to the Statutory Audit Committee, and communicates
with the Committee without restrictions or intermediation.
