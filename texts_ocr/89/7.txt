Any further limitations to this scope of reporting, with reference to the coverage of specific indicators, have
been disclosed where appropriate in the CNFS itself. Such limitations do not affect the representativeness
of the Group’s results and assets, as required by Italian Legislative Decree 254/16.

The data reported in the Statement refer to FY 2019-20, and are compared with those for the two previous
financial years.

With reference to the data for FY 2018-19, it has been decided to update some of the figures that have
proved to be inaccurate in this year’s CNFS. The updated figures are shown and highlighted in section 8.3
Energy consumption and CO, emissions.

1.3 Reporting process

The Mediobanca Group's CNFS as at 30 June 2020 has been drawn up on the basis of a structured
reporting process which entailed:

© The involvement of all company units and divisions responsible for the material areas and for the
information included in the Statement. The representatives identified described the significant
initiatives undertaken during the reporting period, and assisted at the stage of collecting, analysing
and consolidating the data, with the responsibility for checking and validating all the information
stated in the Statement, each for their own area of responsibility. In particular, in order to meet the
requisites of Italian Legislative Decree 254/16 and the GRI Standards, the information contained in the
Statement has been managed via data collection reports for the qualitative data, while the quantitative
data has been entered in the same IT platform used to manage the Group's consolidated financial
reporting. This process is governed via a specific internal Directive, which includes formal validation by
the contributing units. The data is processed via extractions and point-in-time calculations, and also
estimates (where specifically stated). The earnings and financial data and information have been taken
from the Mediobanca Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2020;

© Approval of the Statement by the Board of Directors, called to adopt the accounts for the financial year
ended 30 June 2020, subject to prior review by the management Sustainability Committee, the CSR
Committee set up by the Board of Directors, and the Statutory Audit Committee;

© Assurance for the Statement by PricewaterhouseCoopers in the form of a limited review;

© Publication of the Statement on the company website to make it fully transparent and available to all
stakeholders.

The Group also launched a process to strengthen the internal controls system for non-financial information
in the course of 2019, with the aim of formalizing the main risks, responsibilities and controls. In particular
the programme involved an initial assessment phase to identify points requiring attention, which, based
on the results produced, will continue throughout 2020 as well, with the activities of defining, testing and
formalizing controls in terms of objectives, instruments and owners.
