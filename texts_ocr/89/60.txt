© Time bank: an annual time bank has been set up consisting of a number of hours’ paid absence in
addition to ordinary leave, to be used by staff in serious personal and/or family circumstances. Hours
are contributed to the time bank by the company and by the employees themselves, who can donate
their time voluntarily to colleagues in difficulty.

© Flexi-time: this solution is available for most staff who work seven and a half hours per day.

© Paid and unpaid leave: in addition to the possibilities provided for by the regulations and national
collective labour contract in force, further leave can be taken in cases where children with learning
difficulties require assistance, and for periods where children are starting kindergarten or infant school
for the first time.

We have also run the Un Fiocco in Azienda programme again, to assist parents in facing the birth of a
child without anxiety and facilitate returning to the company, by providing a series of dedicated services:

© Collective training/information courses: the aim is to help women manage the changes that come
with motherhood serenely, improve communications with their partners, and recognize the signs in
the event of any psychological difficulties developing;

© Prenatal nutrition programme: the objective here is to encourage healthy eating to reduce the rate of
complications in pregnancy due to excessive weight gain and/or poor diet;

© Paediatrics card: this is a service which enables users to locate a paediatrician promptly in emergency
situations, which is valid for the child’s first year of life;

© Fathers’ group: group meetings for fathers, providing an opportunity to develop the psychological and
relational challenges posed by the prospect of becoming a father.

On the topic of parenting, Mediobanca and MIS have launched Working Parents, a course dedicated to
helping employees who have become parents in the last two years reconcile the respective spheres of
parenting and working. The idea behind this project is that supporting people at such an important stage
of their lives is an essential part in helping them to grow which in turn creates value for the company. The
programme has been enhanced with a session dedicated to parents of teenagers.

5.4 Protection of Human Rights
[GRI 102-41], [GRI 402-1], [GRI 406-1]

The Group believes that respect of human rights is a fundamental prerequisite to its own sustainability.
For this reason it seeks to protect and promote such rights in the conduct of its business, and in
particular in the way in which it manages relations with its clients, suppliers and commercial partners,
as well as in its relations with its own collaborators.

Respect for each collaborator’s personality and dignity is fundamental in order to develop a working
environment which is based on mutual trust and loyalty, in accordance with all legal obligations in force
in every geographical region and area in which the Group operates.

Although breach of human rights has never been highlighted as a significant risk, the Group is committed
to preventing every type of discrimination, from the selection process to the setting of remuneration,
from opportunities for professional development to the conclusion of the working relationship.
