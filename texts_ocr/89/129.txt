8.4.2 Paper consumption and waste management

[GRI 301-1], [GRI 301-2], [GRI 306-2]

Monitoring of paper and waste is an important issue, in that it allows the Group to intervene with
campaigns and initiatives to reduce their consumption by staff members.

The use of paper relates chiefly to the need to print and deliver documentation and/or presentations
to the Group’s clients and stakeholders. The Group is committed to developing initiatives to
reduce the consumption of paper and printing, to the dematerialization of all processes, to raising
awareness among staff of the environmental impact of their daily actions, and to promoting
virtuous habits.

To this end, the Group is committed to sourcing paper from responsibly managed sources™.
The initiatives in particular should be noted in this connection:
© All newly-supplied computers are Energy Star-certified by the TPM group;

© Allcredit cards provided to Compass Banca staff members since November 2019 have been in
PLA (polylactid acid), which is 90% natural being made from biological materials derived
mainly from corn;

© Mediobanca Innovation Services where possible uses electronic devices that have been
refurbished, and in so doing have contributed to the planting of 1,250 trees in 2020, equal to
11,6875 kg of CO.,

Toner for printers is another material of which consumption is significant.

To reduce consumption and promote the use of sustainable materials, the Group has promoted a
series of initiatives and launched various specific programmes:

© Follow me: for all printers at the various offices, which involves printing via a shared printing
queue at centralized printers. Every time a staff member wants to print a document, they have
to go to the shared printer and enter an access code directly. The campaign has led to a
significant reduction in the amount of printing (especially in the number of mistakes or printouts
which are forgotten), raising awareness among staff of the issues of sustainability and
responsible uses of paper;

© Printers default configured to double-sided printing;

© Staff have been encouraged to make greater use of virtual PowerPoint presentations and
electronic systems during meetings with clients and stakeholders, to reduce the number of
printed copies;

© Increased digitalization in commercial activities in retail banking, through paperless statements
and pdf information prospectus;

© CheBanca! and Compass have advanced electronic signature service using graphology
techniques, which enable customers to sign off instructions and carry out certain investment
activities online;

61. Eg, Ecolabel paper or paper which is FSC certified (Forest Stewardship Council) to indicate that the wood has been correctly forested according to rigorous
environmental, social and economic standards.
