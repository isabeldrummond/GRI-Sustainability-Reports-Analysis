Personal data protection and data security
[GRI 418-1]

Protection of customers’ personal data and information is a key factor in providing our activities,
and as such requires proper governance. The Group is committed to ensuring that personal data
is collected and processed in compliance with the legal provisions in force. This includes electronic
data, paper documents and verbal exchanges via phone calls or direct communications.

Information of different kinds is processed and managed regarding significant issues such as:
transactions, contracts, and confidential customer and staff. The Group undertakes to protect such
data from unauthorized or accidental alteration, loss or unauthorized disclosure. It also ensures,
in accordance with the business requirements, the availability and integrity of information which
must be reliable and usable on the part of the users.

The regulations on personal data protection are applied within the Mediobanca Group based on
the following model:

© Mediobanca and all Italian Group companies which process personal data, apply in full the
provisions of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the “General Data Protection Regulation”, or
“G@DPR"), along with those of the Italian regulations (cluster 1);

© The Group companies established in the EU that process personal data and the non-ltalian
Group companies not established in the EU but which provide goods or services — exclusively
or even only in part —to natural persons in the EU, process their data by applying the provisions
of the GDPR, along with the relevant local regulations (cluster 2);

© The non-Italian Group companies not included in the first two clusters, when processing
personal data, comprise cluster 3.

Each Group company is responsible its own data processing and protection, to guarantee which
security objectives and principles have been identified.

Governance of the risks associated with the processing of personal data is guaranteed: for cluster
1, via (i) adoption of the general measures contained in the Group Personal Data Protection Policy,
and (ii) appointment of a DPO, permitted under Article 37 of the GDPR; for clusters 2 and 3, via
co-ordination between the DPO of Mediobanca and the local compliance officers, or the DPO of the
company concerned if one has been appointed.
