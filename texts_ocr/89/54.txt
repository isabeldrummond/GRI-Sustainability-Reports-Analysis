5.2 Mediobanca Group staff: job creation and protection
[GRI 102-7], [GRI 102-8], [GRI 401-1], [GRI 405-1]

At the end of the financial year under review, the Mediobanca Group had a total of 4,920 staff on its
books, 3% higher than last year, 42% of whom are women. The majority of the Group's staff, some 89%,
is based in Italy, confirming our strong local roots. The most-represented professional category is that

of “white collars”, which accounts for 50% of the total.

The Group has had to move some staff from the United Kingdom to Italy, France and Spain as a result

of Brexit.
