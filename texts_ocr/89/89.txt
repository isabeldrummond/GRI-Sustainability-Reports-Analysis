CheBanca! has always listed very carefully to its customers, via all the touch points
available to them, from the branches to customer service, to home banking,
email and social media channels. It also guarantees ongoing, structured coverage of
complaints, with close monitoring which is shared with the management at regular intervals.
Feedback is collected annually for clients of both CheBanca! and its leading
competitors. The responses are compared to identify difficulties and opportunities,
degree of customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. This monitoring is carried out
through all channels, and involves recording the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) in its core
segments**, which for the year under review was 74, and the Net Promoter Score (NPS) indicator,
28, with a particular focus on the world of investments.

CheBanca! also performs a sentiment analysis among the leading social media, to monitor
brand positioning and identify possible critical areas which could result in reputational damage
to the company’s image.

Given the importance of confidentiality in relations with its clients, Mediobanca Private Banking
does not use surveys. However, ongoing dialogue between FAs and their clients is crucial to its
business model, in order to achieve maximum customer satisfaction and at the same time
make the services offered ever more efficient and innovative. Events are also organized
regularly throughout Italy, where issues of particular importance to wealth management,
creation or protection are discussed.
