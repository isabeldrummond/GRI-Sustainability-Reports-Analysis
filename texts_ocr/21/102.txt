Responsible selection of the

supply chain

Given the mostly intangible nature of the business, the Cerved
supply chain, 90% of which is located in the territory in which the
Group operates directly or through its subsidiaries, is made up
entirely of suppliers of works and services of a purely intellectual
nature, which are divided into three main categories.

The categories of suppliers of the Cer-

ved Group are:

fil Suppliers who offer business
support through consultancy,
professional services, databases
and ICT;

Suppliers who offer personnel
support through catering servic-
es, business travel, welfare meas-
ures and fleet management;

Support for physical infrastruc-
ture through lease & rentals,
facility management (i.e. all ser-
vices dedicated to cleaning, main-
tenance and surveillance) and
utilities.

According with the Environmental
Policy, where possible, Group prac-
tices establish that all the purchases

should be oriented towards the mini-
misation of supplier travel costs (e.g.
focus on territorial coverage of facility
service providers) and the transport/
transfer of goods and equipment. The
purchase process through tenders is
centralised with the Procurement &
Facility Management function and es-
tablishes that selection must be based
on professional skills, organisational
solidity and the search for the best val-
ue for money, and, where possible, on
socio-environmental criteria.

Supplier selection is carried out
through a dedicated procurement
procedure and consultation of the
“Cerved Group Score”, combined
with high-level market scouting. The
Cerved Group Score is the Group’s

Proportion of supplier expenditure concentrated by geographical area®®
