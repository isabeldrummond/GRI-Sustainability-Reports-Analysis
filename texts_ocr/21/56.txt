ence to the type of risk, the Group car-
ried out checks to understand:

> the counterparties;

ey Laundering Policy which was ap-
proved by the Board of Directors on

corporate website in the “Investor Re-
lations & ESG" section.

b Economic and product responsibi-
lity, technological innovation

The main risks that the Group iden-
tified in this area are related to the
following factors:

> process complexity due to signifi-
cant interactions with other compa-
ny stakeholders;

> increasingly stricter product/service
release timing;

> product regulatory compliance
checks right from the planning
stage.

The Group implemented activities
to communicate the Group's stra-
tegic initiatives to the market and to
periodically monitor their status of
progress compared to what original-
ly communicated. Communication
channels with stakeholders were
also set up that allow immediate com-
munication of any updates and signif-
icant events that may have an impact
on the initiatives.

Cerved Group adopted a Responsi-
ble Marketing Policy which was ap-
proved by the Board of Directors on
13 March 2020 and is available on the
corporate website in the “Investor Re-
lations & ESG" section.

There were no cases of non-compli-
ance with regulations and/or self-reg-
ulatory codes regarding product/
service information and labelling or
marketing communications, including

advertising, promotion and sponsor-
ships.

» Environmental compliance

The main risk identified by the Group
with regard to environmental issues
regards the ineffective and incom-
plete monitoring and measuring
of energy consumption and of rel-
evant greenhouse gas emissions, as
well as climate change topics that
could have an impact on access to the
Group's premises".

The Group dealt with the gradual im-
plementation of a system for moni-
toring energy consumption and emis-
sions throughout all offices: it defined
the persons in charge and monitored
consumption in the CED (Centro Elab-
orazione Dati or Electronic Data Pro-
sessing) rooms and energy-intensive
infrastructures. With regard to climate
change issues, mitigation measures
were taken, including specific action
on potentially impacted premises
and the assignment of laptops to
employees.

Cerved Group adopted an Environ-
mental Policy which was approved
by the Board of Directors on 13 March
2020 and is available on the corporate
website in the “Investor Relations &
ESG" section.

There were no instances of non-com-
pliance with environmental laws and
regulations.

>» Human rights

The main risks in this area are relat-
ed to debt collection activities, i.e.,
non-compliance with the principles
set out in the Group’s Human Rights
Policy and drawn up on the basis
of the UNIREC Code of Conduct for
Credit Management and Protection
Processes. To mitigate this risk, the
Group drafted several debt collection
procedures and dedicated a specific
section of the Group’s Policy on the
respect for human rights to respon-
sible debt collection.

snowfall on Mangone
and access to premises
temporarily unavai-
