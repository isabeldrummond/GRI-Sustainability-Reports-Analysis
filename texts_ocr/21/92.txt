As part of its business information

activity, Cerved collects and processes

information in compliance with indus-

try regulations. Compliance with the

provisions of the Privacy Code and the

Code of Deontology ensures respect

of the right of the parties being sur-

veyed and any individuals or other

interested parties linked with them

economically.

Specifically regarding the activity of
Cerved Rating Agency, in order to
ensure the quality and integrity of
the rating process and the independ-
ence of the assessments, the compa-
ny adopted a Corporate Governance
Code in line with the principles pro-
posed by IOSCO (International Organ-
ization of Securities Commissions). In

and of response times where spe-
cific SLAs (Service Level Agreements)
have been defined with customers.

For example, we report the uptime?’ -
defined as the time interval for which
a service is available within a given pe-
riod of time, of some of the main com-
pany platforms:

addition, Cerved Rating Agency pub-
lishes a Transparency Report every
year which is designed to explain to
the market and the interested parties
all the information needed to under-
stand its governance, main policies
and the activities of the control func-
tions.

The information processed by the
Centrale dei Bilanci (CeBi) area is rel-
evant to the extent that it is included
in most of the Credit Information
services supplied by Cerved. Specifi-
cally, CeBi oversees the development
and maintenance of the scoring suite
called CGS Cerved Group Score, on
the basis of which the credit reliabili-
ty of the parties queried on Cerved's
platforms is assessed. The adoption
of formally established and audited
analysis processes and procedures
safeguards the objectivity of the
analyses performed, the quality of
the analysed data and the reliability
of the models’ results. In this context,
official technical-operational stand-
ards, control procedures, dedicated
reports and a process for the continu-
ous monitoring of proprietary models
were formally established.
