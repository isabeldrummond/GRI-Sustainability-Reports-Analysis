> An initial classification phase;

> An in-depth analysis;

improvement actions.

The resources involved are constant-
ly trained for the launch of any new
products and services and/or evolu-
tion of existing ones. Thanks to the
alignment with the omnichannel evo-
lution of the interlocutors, there are
no limitations in the choice of chan-
nels through which complaints may
be filed. Thanks to the use of digitised
records, the trend in formalised and
received complaints is monitored by
the Credit Management and Business
Information areas. The sharing of this
information with management and
the control functions takes place on a
monthly basis through a report on the
trends in written complaints, prepared
ona quantitative and qualitative basis.
The Credit Management area has be-
gun a revision of its approach regard-
ing terminology and _ classification,
with the aim of guaranteeing the same
treatment of all complaints through
a tracing, management and resolution
process uniform for all portfolios.

Lastly, processes to monitor improve-
ment activities are being defined,
which will make it possible to antici-
pate and satisfy customer need in
a more proactive and innovative way.
The complaint resolution activity is
carried out through a Quality Based
model using the following resolution
approaches:
> Preventive: uses an end-to-end
modality to engage the employees
responsible for resolving customer
complaints in all operating process-
es;
> Operational: creates a consultant

type and horizontal relationship with
the other organisational units, to de-
fine control safeguards and provide
legal support to address business
needs aimed at achieving commer-
cial and performance objectives;

> Proactive: identifies the areas that
need improvement in all company
processes with a Quality Based mod-
el, formalising the remedial action
plans and monitoring and support-
ing their implementation.

In addition to a Customer Satisfac-
tion survey in 2018 which will be re-
peated every two years and thus in
2020, the Group further stepped up
the opportunities to meet and in-
teract with its customers, intensifying
the planning of physical events (con-
ventions and festivals) and virtual
events (webinars) staged to support
the different areas of business. The
initiatives were undertaken with the
dual objective of expanding the mar-
ket and facilitating the collection
of commercial contacts, such as
Cerved Next, Webinar Fondo Centrale
PMI, Osservitalia, Fondazione Bellisa-
rio, Industria Felix (with 4 events), Con-
findustria, Fintech District, Anti-Money
Laundering Exhibition, Confires and
Credit Fair.

In 2019, with the goal of increasingly
customising the customer journey,
the Group implemented tools and
algorithms aimed at improving
customer profiling and thus deliv-
ering an offering of information that
matched the actual interests. At the
same time, several lead generation
campaigns were activated with the
objective of creating new contact op-
portunities and broadening the cus-
tomer base.
