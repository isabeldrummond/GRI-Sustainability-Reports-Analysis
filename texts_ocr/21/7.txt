THE NEW APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY

A long-term vision requires aligning the interests of a company with those of the
community in which it operates and with those of all its stakeholders. This principle
defines a company’s sustainable growth and in 2079 it openly became part of
Cerved's strategy.

Aware of our important social role, we have undertaken a journey to extensively
incorporate sustainability principles and actions into our business strategy and daily
activities. We operate in the belief that sustainability drives a process of continuous
improvement, a process that guarantees long-term results, strengthens economic
performance, reputation and workers’ health and safety, and allows environmental
and social goals to be achieved.

The 2019 Sustainability Report, drawn up pursuant to Italian Decree 254/2016,
clearly conveys how social, environmental and governance aspects are increasingly
core issues for Cerved. The document explains the sustainable and socially
responsible growth path embarked on by the Group, starting with a clear
identification of its stakeholders and an assessment of key sustainability issues,
through intense and increasing engagement activities at various levels.

OUR PURPOSE AND SHARED VALUE

In 2019 we launched a corporate reorganisation process that allowed us to set up
a new governance model for better management of ESG issues. We appointed an
ESG manager who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and we started

to identify improvement actions to give shape to our commitment. These actions
will be formalised in a Sustainability Plan during 2020, in line with our business
strategy. In the wake of the changes, we defined our Purpose, the Group’s core
mission, that is, to “help the national economic system protect itself from risk and
sustainably grow”. The contribution we have provided to our country over the
years, through cooperation with institutions, bodies and associations and through
partnerships aimed at publishing studies and organising events having a significant
cultural impact, continued in 2019. With Cerved Next 2019, together with the entire
business community we once again took stock of data-driven economy, bringing
together in one single day all the actors working in this field. The large number of
participants is a sign that there is a wish to understand, to look beyond, to imagine
a progress that steers digital revolution starting from data. The challenge involves
both companies, which must ride the digital transformation wave to continue to be
competitive globally, and the world of financial institutions, which, also driven by
new regulations, is making its business models increasingly more digital.

We will soon launch “Cerved per Italia”, the guiding thread that will accompany our
activities and which is an expression of our corporate Purpose: helping the national
economic system grow and protect itself from risk by putting data, technologies and
talent at the service of people, businesses, banks and institutions. Even outside our
usual business.
