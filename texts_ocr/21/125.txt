CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

39 The new Car Policy for
2020 provides for the
introduction of diesel
vehicles with a maxi-
mum CO2 emission
factor of 125 g/km and
Full Hybrid and Mild
Hybrid vehicles.

come into force in 2020 as well as
introduce new vehicles* with low CO,
emissions.

d Real estate and energy efficiency

As stated in the Code of Ethics and
reiterated in the Environmental Pol-
icy, Cerved undertakes to adopt an
approach geared towards energy sav-
ing and the containment of emissions
into the atmosphere by optimising en-
ergy consumption and reducing emis-
sions into the atmosphere from the
vehicles, tools, properties and infra-
structures used, in particular through
an increasing supply from renew-
able sources, investment in energy
efficiency projects and the use of IT
tools which, where possible, have en-
ergy certifications.

The whole organisation has increased

its commitment to the environment

by working on the various aspects

related to the energy efficiency of

buildings:

> elements have been introduced in
maintenance contracts which are
aimed at consumption optimisa-
tion and environmental diagnos-
tics;

> already in 2018, the Bari office relo-
cated to a new facility with high en-
ergy performance (A1), leveraging
the sustainable use of energy sourc-
es specific to the Group's operating
context;

> at the San Donato Milanese office,
the windows were fitted with sun
control films that optimise equip-
ment performance, help reduce en-
ergy consumption and improve inte-
rior comfort;

> at the Mangone office, the replace-
ment of the boiler with a more ef-
ficient system contributed to a 4%
energy saving.

> Introduction of energy consump-
tion detection systems of the CED
(Data Processing Center) of Padua

In particular, a project to optimise
the management of the building's
air conditioning systems operating
hours in San Donato Milanese led in
2019 to energy savings of around
3% compared to the previous year.
Considering the increase in the or-
ganisational structure of the Cerved
Group over the last year, the increase
in head count (increased by about
6%) and the larger amount of square
metres occupied (about 8% more
than the previous year), it is reasona-
ble to assume that the energy benefit
obtained is far greater.

Following the acquisition operations
carried out by the Group, there was an
increase in energy consumption be-
tween 2018 and 2019 due to the inclu-
sion of foreign offices (approx. 500,000
KWH), new offices (approx. 300,000
KWH) and all the other locations in
which the accounting is not direct
and follows condominium/contractu-
al logics (approx. 1,000,000 KWH). If
the values are considered on a like-
for-like basis, a reduction in over-
all site consumption of around 1%
would be recorded. Parameterizing
the number of employees, second-
ed employees and associates in the
Group's buildings with respect to the
energy consumption and total GHG
emissions, there is a decrease in the
energy intensity value equal to 11.28
GJ per unit in 2019 (equal to 13.31 GJ
per unit in 2018) and the value relating
to the GHG emission intensity is equal
to 0.95 tCO, per unit (equal to 1.06
tCO, per unit in 2018).

For further details regarding direct
and indirect consumption, GHG emis-
sion and energy intensity, please refer

dix section.
