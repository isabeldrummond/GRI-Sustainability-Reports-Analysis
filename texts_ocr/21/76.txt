SMART WORKING AS A WINNING
EXAMPLE OF WORK-LIFE BALANCE

Mutual trust, empowerment and fo-
cus on wellbeing are the pillars of
smart working, an agile and eco-sus-
tainable work modality that enables
employees to perform their activities
remotely, without the need for their
physical presence.

Since 2017, the year in which smart
working was launched, the project
has grown and over 1,400 employees
have now the option to work remotely
one day a week: the programme also
plans to extend remote working to dif-
ferent company areas. There are three
places where Cerved smart workers
can choose to work from: their home,
a co-working area or a company hub.

Smart working is a strong example of
how the company’s principles are
rooted in everyday life; the princi-
ple of a trust-based culture spreads
throughout a mindset that enables re-
mote work, based on results, not on
the physical presence of people. Fur-
thermore, smart working is atten-
tive to sustainability: in 2019, over
30,000 days of smart working were
used by our employees, thus avoiding
the need to travel to and from work.

Employee engagement and
employee satisfaction

The first anonymous change man-
agement Pulse Survey was launched
in December 2019 addressing all
Cerved employees and associates on
Workplace on the date it was launched
(3,562 people, 1,148 of which respond-
ents), to understand the engagement
of the people working for Cerved. The
Survey will be repeated once a month
for at least 11 times (6 questions on a
scale of 1-5) divided by BU, age group
and employee seniority. The objec-

tive is to accompany changes in the
post-reorganisation and launch phase
of Purposes and principles by listening
to the people involved with the aim to
monitor their well-being during the
change management phases and im-
plement any corrective actions. The
first survey brought to light very posi-
tive results: 89% of employees would
suggest Cerved as an employer.

74 The employees of
foreign companies
were excluded (Proweb
guarantees additional
maternity leave for 2
weeks and paternity
leave for 1 week) as
well as the employees
of the Italian compa-
nies MBS Consulting,
Dyna Green, Innovation
Team, Quaestio, Juliet,
Credit Management,
Click Adv, ProWebIitalia,
Major, Cerved Fin Line,
Cerved Master Service
and Spazio Dati.
