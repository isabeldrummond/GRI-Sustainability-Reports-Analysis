Community support through
donations and sponsorships

In addition to the main community support activities, Cerved
also carries out utility and social solidarity activities that can
positively affect and bring benefits to the community.

As defined in the Code of Ethics and
reaffirmed by the Community Sup-
port Policy approved by the Board of
Directors on 13 March 2020, the pro-
jects aim to satisfy needs expressed
in the social, educational, training and
environmental spheres, as well as
those of sports and art.

Milano City Marathon: Cerved sup-
ported the RunChallenge project pro-
moted by the PlayMore! Association
to introduce disabled children to
running. The Group participated in
the solidarity race with two company
relay teams, each comprised of four
employees. The eight runners/fund-
raisers were able to raise addition-
al funds for each relay race through
sponsorships provided by colleagues
and friends.

Maria Letizia Verga Committee:
Cerved gave a donation to support
this organisation that devotes its activ-
ity to the study and cure of child leu-
kaemia. The offer of qualified medical
and psycho-social assistance guaran-
tees the young patients the highest
possibility of being cured and a better
quality of life. Employees then partici-
pated in a fundraiser for research and
were involved in the initiative #Uno-
DueTreStella with the aim of collect-
ing gifts for the patients of the care
home.

The Cerved Group has made the prin-
ciple of giving back to communities
in which it operates its own, always
showing sensitivity and openness to
support the needy with which it shares
the territory. With this in mind, the in-
itiative “Cara Cerved Ti Scrivo” was
launched, which invites all employees
to propose deserving projects aimed
in particular at children and young
people who live in difficult situa-
tions, promoted by non-profit asso-
ciations active in the regions where
the group has offices. “Caro Cerved
Ti Scrivo” is an ad hoc interdiscipli-
nary committee made up of repre-
sentatives of all the Group's corporate
functions which meets monthly to
examine the proposals received and
identify the projects to be supported.

The project is inspired by the prin-
ciples of transparency, which is re-
flected in the entire evaluation and re-
porting process, as well as by sharing
initiatives analysed and identified by
the Committee on the basis of propos-
als received from employees. The initi-
ative was launched in December 2019,
and more details on the selected ac-
tivities and projects will be described
in the Sustainability Report relating to
the reporting period of 2020.
