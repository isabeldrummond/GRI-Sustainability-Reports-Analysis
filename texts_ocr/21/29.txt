CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

 

Sustainability strategy and
Sustainability plan

Cerved Group’s ambitious aim is to maintain leadership in its
sector and continue to generate shared value for itself and its

stakeholders.

To achieve this aim, in 2019 Cerved
undertook a journey to extensive-
ly incorporate sustainability prin-
ciples and actions into its busi-
ness strategy and daily activities.
Specifically, Cerved made its social
role firmly take shape in its new
Purpose and started a process to give
it full effect by defining principles,
actions and medium and long-term
goals able to steer its business. The
areas in which Cerved's sustainabili-
ty strategy is being developed will be
identified by:
> listening to its main stakeholders
and the people who make up Cerved;
> analysing the ESG main mac-
ro-trends and integrating the Sus-
tainable Development Goals (SDGs)
> implementing the recommenda-
tions of the Control, Risk and Sus-
tainability Committee.

Since Cerved is a public company, in-
vestors play a key role among stake-
holders: as early as 2019, all the in-
structions received from the leading
sustainability rating agencies and the
topics that emerged during discus-
sions with institutional investors were
assessed.

The work started in 2019 and led to
an initial identification of short-term
goals and actions which were already
achieved in the first months of the
year.

In the course of 2020, the areas iden-
tified will be broken down into an
organic plan of specific actions, with

priorities assigned on the basis of rel-
evance to stakeholders and risk anal-
ysis. Special attention will be given to
developing solutions that help busi-
nesses make responsible choices
and so contributing to the sustainable
growth of the Italian economic system.
In order to successfully implement its
strategy, Cerved believes that it is es-
sential to connect the clear responsi-
bilities assigned to people and struc-
tures with the actions it has identified,
and to implement an impact moni-
toring system created with specific
ESG KPIs. Finally, management's goals
will be aligned with the company’s im-
pact goals by acting on the incentive
systems at various levels.

Cerved analysed its contribution to
the achievement of the UN-SDGs and
identified the 9 UN-SDGs in which it
is likely to provide a significant in-
put (see "Scope of Action" table in
the following page).

The actions relating to the various
material topics identified through
the materiality matrix were grouped
into six specific topics and associ-
ated with each of the 9 UN-SDGs
previously identified. This ensured
greater consistency with business
organisation, with the responsibilities
assigned and with the structure of the
content set out in this Sustainability
Report (see the "Three-Year sustaina-
bility plan" in the following pages).
