CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

The 2018 Natural Gas value was updated following the improvement of the con-
sumption monitoring system also for the purpose of greater completeness of the
scope.

Please note that 2017 data are not comparable since referred to a different peri-
meter.

Energy intensity

For the purpose of calculating the energy intensity, the value relating to the total
consumption shown in table "27. Direct and indirect consumption" was used,
parameterized to the total number of employees, seconded workers and asso-
ciates present at the Cerved Group buildings.

* The value for Natural Gas 2018 was adjusted following the improvement of the consumption monitoring system which was also expanded
and extended to all the perimeter offices

With regard to the car fleet, it should be noted that the emission factors used
refer to the average of CO, emissions per Km, declared by the parent company
in the WLTP (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) test cycle for
each individual model in the car fleet. Compared to that which was indicated in
2018, the data indicated was grouped by vehicle type and was recalculated using
the emission factors described above.
