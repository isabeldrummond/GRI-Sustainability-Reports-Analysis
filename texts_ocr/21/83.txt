CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

 

“® Health and safety

@ %4

As enshrined in the Human Rights Policy, one of the Group’s
commitments is that “Cerved promotes a culture of health
and safety in the workplace, promoting risk prevention and
awareness along with responsible employee conduct.

The Group also undertakes to ensure
that the work environment and rela-
tive stress conditions are kept below
the legal thresholds and such as to
not affect employees’ mental and
physical integrity”.

This issue is addressed through or-
ganisational measures consistent
with the requirements of Italian Leg-
islative Decree no. 81/2008 (Consol-
idated Law on Occupational Health
and Safety). A Risk Assessment Doc-
ument is prepared for each Group
company, consistent with regulations
and company structures. In this re-
gard, reports on the outcome of the
activities of the Supervisory Bodies
that verify content and evaluate man-
agement activities are submitted pe-
riodically. In addition, meetings are
held at least once a year with the
members of first aid and fire-fighting
teams to review the main critical is-
sues and implement appropriate cor-
rective actions. In 2019, the Group
began evaluating the stress-relat-
ed work risk for each location, which
will be completed by 2021, with the
purpose to improve the monitoring
of mental health and implement pre-

vention measures (stress manage-
ment courses as the Cerved Feeel
Good initiative mentioned before, job
redisign, or eventual general adjust-
ments regarding work load).

Lists of the members of the emer-
gency teams and the emergency and
evacuation plans, designed to achieve
proper handling of safety issues at
all locations, are posted on the com-
pany’s Intranet. The prevention initia-
tives mentioned above are bolstered
by constant attention to the manda-
tory training required by Italian Leg-
islative Decree no. 81/08, concerning
the protection of employee health and
safety and the training of emergency
teams.

With the aim of strengthening the
value of the culture of safety, since
2018 Cerved has embarked on a car-
dio-prevention path which led to the
installation of semiautomatic defibril-
lators at the locations of San Donato
Milanese, Mangone and Turin and the
relative training of more than 80 peo-
ple as authorised personnel for use in
emergency situations.
