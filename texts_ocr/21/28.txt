ity activities.

Cerved also considered it appropriate

to entrust the company’s top executive

body, the Executive Management

Committee, with the management

of relevant sustainability issues. In

2019, the Committee was also tasked

with:

> assessing the significance of sus-
tainability issues of relevance to
the Group in terms of management;

> supporting the identification of in-
ternal and external stakeholder rep-
resentatives that will be involved in
stakeholder engagement activities;

> supporting ESG risk assessment;

> identifying and monitoring quan-
titative goals and targets to define
the Group's Sustainability Plan;

> supporting the non-financial re-
porting process.

Lastly, Sustainability Ambassadors
were appointed. Their role is to pro-
mote and disseminate the culture

of sustainability and to support the
Working Group in the design of spe-
cific initiatives and the drafting of the
Non-Financial Statement.

The Internal Control and Risk Man-
agement System of the Cerved
Group consists of a set of rules, pro-
cedures and organisational structures
intended to suitably identify, measure,
manage and monitor the main risks,
and ensure that the business is run
consistently with the set objectives.
The Group recognises that it is essen-
tial to incorporate ESG (Environmen-
tal, Social, Governance) risks within
the risk management system. For
this reason, it strengthened the map-
ping of ESG Risks, through specific
classification. It also supplemented
these risks with the results of the up-
dated risk mapping and assessment
activities carried out. As a result of this
activity, Cerved Group’s overall risk
catalogue (so-called “Risk Universe”)
was updated.
