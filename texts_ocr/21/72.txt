CAREER DAY, PARTNERSHIPS
WITH UNIVERSITIES AND SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY

For the Group, making its business
known to the outside world is a
strategic lever to better position the
company and lay the foundations
for the Cerved of the future. For this
reason, in 2019 a structured plan was
designed for the current Academic
Year, consisting of widespread par-
ticipation in Career Days, company
testimonials and round tables at lead-
ing Universities in Italy and Roma-

nia. Social media campaigns were
launched to spread awareness about
the initiatives dedicated to junior pro-
files.

With a view to social responsibility to-
wards the community and to enhanc-
ing the talent of young people, Cerved
also sponsors scholarships for de-
serving students, thanks to the col-
laboration with Associations, Univer-
sity Colleges and innovative start-ups
that encourage young people's inte-
gration into the world of work.

Training and development

Employee training represents an investment that generates
double value: for the organisation and for the people that

belong to it. It is with this awareness that Cerved offers to

Group employees development paths and programmes aimed at
increasing and enhancing the capabilities of each individual.
