In particular, we held meetings and interviews with the management of Cerved Group SpA and
with the personnel of Cerved Credit Management Group Srl and Cerved Rating Agency SpA
and we performed limited analysis of documentary evidence, to gather information about the
processes and procedures for the collection, consolidation, processing and submission of the
non-financial information to the function responsible for the preparation of the NFS.
Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group:

- at holding level,

a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the NFS, and in
particular to the business model, the policies adopted and the main risks, we
carried out interviews and acquired supporting documentation to verify their
consistency with availableevidence;

b) with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical
procedures as well as limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the
accuracy of consolidation of the information;

- for Cerved Group SpA, Cerved Credit Management Group Srl and Cerved Rating
Agency SpA, which were selected on the basis of their activities and their contribution
to the performance indicators at a consolidated level, we carried out meetings with the
management and gathered supporting documentation regarding the correct
application of the procedures and calculation methods used for the key performance
indicators.

Conclusions

Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS
of Cerved Group as of 31 December 2019 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance
with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and with the GRI Standards.
