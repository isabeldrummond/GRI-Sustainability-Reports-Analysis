Systematic

the use of our credit solutions even
easier, from crediting to recovery.

Important projects have been
launched that will lead to the develop-
ment of solutions in the following ar-
eas and with the following objectives:

> ESG Solutions: become the refer-
ence provider for ESG assessments
and ratings to SMEs;

> Subsidized Finance: support SMEs
in the process of obtaining subsi-
dised loans;

> Warning systems: be a benchmark
for all economic operators who must
comply with the New Corporate Cri-
sis Regulations;

> Self-diagnosis: allow companies to
understand how to improve their
creditworthiness;

> Anti-Money Laundering: become
the centralised Italian provider of
AML services.

For the Banks channel, the develop-
ment of the two platforms Silos and
MonDo continued, the solution for as-
sessing the persistence of conditions
that determine the credit. In partner-
ship with a specialist in the sector,
Cerved has made its anti-money laun-
dering offer even more complete to
adequately respond to current legis-
lation.

MARKETING SOLUTIONS

The Group's core is data combined
with the specialisation of vertical
players which have become part of
the project with a path of acquisitions
geared towards excellence: from Pay-
Click (digital performance market-
ing) to SpazioDati (smart data), from
Bauciweb (web monitoring) to Pro
Web Consulting (SEO??, CRO* and web
analytics). A virtuous synergy that has
made it possible to compose a unique
integrated offer on the market able
to cover the entire end-to-end value
chain, from data to action: B2B Mar-
keting, Performance, Market Analysis
and CX Transformation.

Cerved ON is the new business di-

vision created in March 2019 with a
well-defined mission: “To allow client
companies to improve performance
starting from data, developing their
markets and growing in terms of vol-
umes”. Cerved ON is dedicated to
marketing services that the Group
launches on the market by leveraging
its peculiarity: being the largest Ital-
ian data-driven company, capable of
obtaining, managing, processing and
making use of an immense wealth of
information, drawing the maximum
value and putting it at the service
of customers with appropriate tools.
A new brand, but firmly built on con-
solidated know-how, on the skills
of well-established actors in their
fields, and on a dedicated structure
with over 200 professionals, 6 offices
throughout Italy, 200 sectors covered
with analyses and reports and 2,300
references and success stories.

In 2019 the products “Target Coun-
tries” and “Business Predictor”
were renewed, adding content and
increasing their appeal thanks to the
digitisation of their output. New prod-
ucts have also been created to meet
the internationalisation needs of cus-
tomers, such as the Foreign scout-
ing product. Lastly, project solutions
were brought together (Customer Sat-
isfaction and Company mapping) to
simplify implementation and reduce
go to market lead times.
