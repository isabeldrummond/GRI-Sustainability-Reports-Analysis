For the purpose of calculating the emission intensity, the value relating to the
total direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions and the indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions
was used calculated with the Location Based methodology, parameterized to the
total number of employees, seconded employees and associates present at the
Cerved Group buildings.
