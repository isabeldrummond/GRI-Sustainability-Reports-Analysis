CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

As part of the collection activities,

with specific reference to compliance

with Consumer Law, the issue of the

respect for debtors’ rights was ad-

dressed in terms of:

> rules and limits when making con-
tact via phone collection and/or tax
collection network;

> contact times and precautions;

> structured control system for both
phone collection and door-to-door
collection activities.

As regards the risks along the Group's
supply chain, Cerved’s procurement
market is mainly in Italy: thanks to ex-
isting laws and ongoing monitoring,
there appear to be no significant
risks in the procurement area. Mon-
itoring of the activities of suppliers is
carried out respecting the rights of
workers, particularly with regard to
the freedom of association and collec-
tive bargaining, preventing the risk of
violations of human rights.

Cerved Group adopted a Human
Rights Policy which was approved by
the Board of Directors on 13 March
2020 and is available on the corporate
website in the “Investor Relations &
ESG” section.

» Personnel management

In the area of human resources man-
agement, the Group identified the fol-
lowing specific risks:

> Planning of company succession
plans;

> Skills development initiatives;

> Development of initiatives aimed
at the engagement of valuable re-
sources (Human Capital Risk).

In order to mitigate these risks, the
Group intensified its training activ-
ities and learning opportunities.
Furthermore, at the conclusion of
their employment relationship with
Cerved, employees are provided with
outplacement tools in collaboration
with external companies, in order to
guarantee a positive transition into
the job market.

Cerved set up various engagement
programmes for its employees
(which will be described in greater de-
tail in the relevant chapters) including
benefit measures, work-life balance,
flexible working hours, smart-working
and exit interviews in order to meas-
ure and understand the reasons that
bring people to leave the Group.

> Relations with institutions

The main risk identified by the Group
is the failure to take into account
the expectations of the institutions
and to not include them when de-
fining the sustainability strategy.
This risk is mitigated through constant
and structured dialogue between the
institutions and Cerved and through
the creation of partnerships that
can create value for all Group stake-
holders.

» Data Security and Cybersecurity

Risks related to IT and system secu-
rity, which are essential for the com-
pany’s operations (in terms of system
availability, data and equipment in-
tegrity, data privacy) as well as any at-
tacks and/or incidents to corporate
IT security, which aim at intercepting
the Group’s confidential information
or information containing data that
may compromise employees’ privacy,
are the main risks connected to the
specific area. In order to monitor and
prevent such risks, Cerved is provided
with an Information Security Man-
agement System that is aligned with
international standard UNI CEI ISO/
IEC 27001:2017. The System estab-
lishes the requirements for defining,
implementing, managing, maintaining
and improving the system as regards
logical, physical and organisational se-
curity aspects.

With a view to an approach of contin-
uous improvement and taking into ac-
count the evolution of IT technologies
available in the market, Cerved con-
tinues to follow a multipronged ap-
proach to improve its management
