CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

proprietary scoring suite on the basis
of which the creditworthiness of the
subjects questioned is assessed. The
merchandise categories with a higher
environmental impact are the subject
of cost management activities and re-
negotiations, with the aim of reducing
consumption and greenhouse gas
emissions.

The selection based on socio-envi-
ronmental criteria continued in 2019
in the calls for tenders for facility
management services of the group’s
properties which, as in 2018, were
carried out at an Italian level and con-
cerned the cleaning, maintenance and
surveillance of buildings and techno-
logical systems. The issues thus iden-
tified are monitored on an ongoing
basis through specific procedures
defined in the technical specifications
(Capitolati Tecnici). Specifically, in or-
der to verify compliance with the
requisite environmental and/or so-
cial standards, suppliers must under-
go detailed on-desk and on-site verifi-
cations for the entire duration of the
contract. The technical specifications
(Capitolati Tecnici) govern the activi-
ties, also of an environmental or social
nature, that suppliers must be able to
control in order to be qualified.
For example, the criteria include:
> environmental certifications re-
garding waste disposal;
> planning and designing activities
and specific field analyses.

The selection through these last cri-

teria takes place with the request of

specific socio-environmental require-

ments and following the evaluations

of impact on sustainability.

Some _beneficial/penalising assess-

ment criteria for scoring computation

are listed below:

> type of products used (e.g., Ecola-
bel certification);

> energy management activities;

> experiences and proposals to re-
duce environmental impact;

> experience and proposals for social
responsibility policies (e.g., certifi-
cations).

By 2020, the Group's goal is to extend
the selection methodology based on
ESG criteria to the whole supply chain.
In line with the provisions of the
Code of Ethics, the Organisation,
Management and Control Models
adopted by the Group Companies and
in compliance with the Human Rights
Policy, suppliers must carry out their
activities in respect for workers’
rights, with particular reference to
freedom of association or collective
bargaining, thus preventing the risk
of violation of human rights. Suppliers
must also agree to operate consist-
ent with the provision of the Organ-
isation, Management and Control
Models (Model 231) regarding anti-
corruption and the Code of Ethics.
The employees responsible for se-
lection are responsible for complying
with the principles of fair competition,
abiding by existing company proce-
dures and selecting suppliers based
on specified criteria.

Considering the specific product cate-
gories purchased and the geographi-
cal location in which the suppliers are
located, the Group has not detected
events and/or highlighted signifi-
cant risks regarding the restriction
of trade union freedoms (right to
free association and collective bar-
gaining of workers), the exploitation
of child labour and/or in dangerous
conditions, nor concerning the use of
forced labour. Cerved has in any case
established that the principles set out
in the Code of Ethics and within the
Group Policies must be respected by
“all persons connected to each Group
Company by working relationships
and, in general, by all those who oper-
ate for these companies, whatever the
relationships that connect them”, thus
also including suppliers.

In line with the new Sustainability
Strategy and the Environmental Poli-
cy the Group has set itself the goal of
carrying out more in-depth mapping
of its supply chain to be able to identi-
fy all the risks related to ESG issues.
On-desk and on-site audits will be car-
ried out following the mapping, specif-
ically on the suppliers most at risk.
