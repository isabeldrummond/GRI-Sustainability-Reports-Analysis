In 2019, Cerved Group S.p.A. - with
the support of an external consultant
expert in 231/2001 issues - conducted
an audit to check the consistency
between Cerved Group S.p.A.’s Mod-
el 231 and the document “Consoli-
dated principles for the drafting of
organisational models and the role
of the supervisory body and possible
re-examination of Italian Legislative
Decree no. 231 of 8 June 2001” issued
by the National Council of Chartered
Accountants and Accounting Experts
and drawn up by the Multidisciplinary
Working Group (CNDCEC, National
Lawyers’ Council and main trade asso-
ciations - ABI and Confindustria).
The analysis showed that “[...] the
Organisation, Management and Con-
trol Model adopted by Cerved Group
S.p.A. is well-structured and has been
drawn up consistently with the pro-
visions of the document “Consolidated
principles for the drafting of organisa-
ional models and the role of the su-
pervisory body and possible re-exami-
nation of Italian Legislative Decree no.
231 of 8 June 2001 [...]". In considera-
ion of the results of this analysis, and
of how the Models 231 of the Group
Companies are structured, the opin-
ion of consistency was subsequent-
ly extended to the Models 231 of all
Group Companies.
Furthermore, in line with the doc-
ument “Consolidated principles for
he drafting of organisational models
and the role of the supervisory body
and possible re-examination of Italian
Legislative Decree no. 231 of 8 June
2001”, Cerved defined a methodolog-
ical framework for the assessment of
potential risks pursuant to Italian Leg-
islative Decree no. 231/2001.
