POLICY ON DIVERSITY IN THE
COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS AND THE BOARD OF
STATUTORY AUDITORS

Cerved recognises, seeks and wel-
comes the benefits of diversity with-
in the Group and within its Corpo-
rate Bodies, in all respects, including
gender, age, seniority, qualifications,
skills, and professional and training
expertise. For this reason, on 5 March
2019, the Board of Directors of Cerved
Group adopted the “Diversity Policy
for Members of Corporate Bodies’,
which identifies the main criteria to
apply when defining the optimal com-
position of the administrative body so
that it may exercise, in the most effec-
tive manner, its powers while benefit-
ing from the contribution of different
and complementary approaches, skills
and experiences. The Policy is avail-

able on the company website and its
aim is to pursue the following goals:

> making the decision-making pro-
cess more effective and in-depth;

> reducing the risk of all members
sharing similar opinions;

> enriching discussion within the
Corporate Bodies by fostering inter-
nal debate and comparison between
experiences that differ in terms of
content and the contexts in which
they are developed;

> allowing the members of the Corpo-
rate Bodies to discuss the decisions
of management constructively;

> fostering turnover within the Cor-
porate Bodies.

With reference to the type of diversi-
ty and associated goals, the Diversity
Policy states that:

i) the majority of the members of
the Board of Directors must be
non-executive and must meet
the independence requirements
laid down by the law and the Cor-
porate Governance Code;

ii) at least one third of the Board of
Directors, both at the time of ap-
pointment and during their terms
of office, shall be composed of di-
rectors from the less represent-
ed gender;

iii) in order to ensure a balance be-
tween the requirements of con-
tinuity and renewal, a balanced
combination must be ensured
between different levels of senior-
ity and age brackets;

iv) non-executive and independent
Directors must have a manage-
ment and/or professional and/or
vocational/academic profile which
comprises a set of diverse and
complementary skills and expe-
rience.

Cerved Group believes that the cur-
rent composition of the Board of Di-
rectors reflects the type of diversity
and relevant goals of the above-de-
scribed policy.
