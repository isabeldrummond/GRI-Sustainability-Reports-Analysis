ECONOMIC VALUE GENERATED AND
DISTRIBUTED

Cerved's contribution to its stakehold-
ers is also measured by the wealth
generated and distributed through
its business and is one of the Group’s
main drivers since it provides a better
understanding of the business’ eco-
nomic aspects and their impact on the
social fabric.

According to the reclassification of
Cerved Group's Income Statement as
at 31 December 2019, the economic
value directly generated and shared
with its stakeholders amounted to
Euro 561.5 million, increasing by over
20% compared to 2018. 62% of the
value generated by Cerved was dis-
tributed to stakeholders, both inter-

nal and external, and the remaining
38% was retained within the Compa-

ny.

These results are due to:

> the added value of a Business
Information approach strongly fo-
cused on the development of new
products and services;

> a targeted strategy, which incorpo-
rates key companies through M&A
operations, thus strengthening the
Group's position on reference mar-
kets and encouraging its entry into
adjacent markets;

> the vigorous growth of the Cred-
it Management division, which
allows us to support financial insti-
tutions in managing their non-per-
forming loans.
