Ethics, Integrity and Anticorruption

CODE OF ETHICS

In the conduct of its activities, Cerved
is guided by its Code of Ethics, a doc-
ument that sets forth the Group's
commitments and responsibilities,
including those of a social, environ-
mental and governance nature. It
also provides the guidelines of con-
duct which must be taken by corpo-
rate body members and by all em-
ployees of Cerved Group’s companies
and, in general, by all persons oper-
ating for these companies, whatever
their relationship with the Group. The
principles embodied in the document
are revised periodically. In 2019, they
were updated by adding principles
concerning the use of Artificial In-
telligence solutions and details on
the management of relations with
trade unions. As specified in the doc-
ument, the Group does not make di-
rect or indirect contributions, in any
form whatsoever, to parties, move-
ments, committees, associations or
other political or union bodies, nor to
their representatives or candidates,
nor to organisations with which a con-
flict of interest may arise.

The Cerved Group gives key value to
the observance of all laws and regu-
lations that govern life and economic
and social activities. It draws constant
inspiration from principles of loyalty
and fairness, reliability and trans-
parency, respect towards people,
organisations, institutions and the en-
vironment.

All Italian and foreign Cerved Group
companies have adopted the Group’s
Code of Ethics, through a specific res-
olution of the Board of Directors. The
Code has also been translated into
English, Greek and Romanian so that
it can be fully understood also by the
staff of the Group's foreign offices.
