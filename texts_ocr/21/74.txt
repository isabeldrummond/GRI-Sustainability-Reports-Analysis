various regulations, including the
Organisation Model 231, the Code

> School of Management: a Perfor-
mance Leadership training course
was developed in 2019 for manag-
ers working in the sales network
and Credit Management area. The
purpose was to share a common
Leadership model within the entire
Group and to align the value mind-
set on issues such as delegation,
feedback, people enhancement and
effective management of inter-func-
tional dynamics. We also carried out
executive coaching courses aimed
at helping managers develop their
leadership skills.

> Team Building activities: through
experience-based workshops and
seminars organised using the Lego
Serious Play methodology, these
internally managed activities seek
to improve cooperation. They also
stimulate a culture of mutual trust

Incentive system, welfare and

and support the dissemination of
shared values such as transparency,
participation, listening and the abili-
ty to handle mistakes constructively,
as an opportunity for learning.

As regards the collection of feedback
on training, after Cerved has delivered
its courses, it provides participants
with a Customer Satisfaction sur-
vey for assessing their satisfaction
and gathering any suggestions for im-
provement.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN

In order to steer individual profession-
al development and strengthen skills
that the Group believes can promote
the professional growth of staff, the
Development Plan is made availa-
ble to all interested parties: this tool
allows staff to implement develop-
ment actions within a set time period
by requesting, in a proactive manner,
interviews with their manager and
HR to exchange view and receive feed-
back to support them?2.

work-life balance

Concern for the quality of life and the wellbeing of the people who
work at the Group is of fundamental importance to Cerved and
translates into concrete actions aimed at guaranteeing a positive

employee experience.

Protecting the wellbeing of the
Group’s people also means sharing
best practices and increasing aware-
ness of how to have a healthy physi-
cal and mental lifestyle: for this rea-
son, the Cerved Feel Good campaign
was launched in 2019, during which
information was provided on correct
nutrition and on handling work-re-

lated stress and physical and men-
tal health through mindfullness prac-
tices. In addition, a vaccination service
for employees interested in this ser-
vice was set up within the company.

In 2019, for the second year running,
Cerved proposed Corporate Welfare.
It expanded the number of recipi-

” The information
included and related to
the training activities

the Group's Italian
companies.
