CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

line with international best practices,
the Cerved Group has launched a
certification path for its operational
processes for the creation and provi-
sion of services, according to the pro-
visions of ISO 22301 Certification on
business continuity management,
whose achievement is anticipated by
the end of 2020.

With a view to an approach of contin-
uous improvement and taking into ac-
count the evolution of IT technologies
available in the market, Cerved con-
tinues to follow a multipronged ap-
proach to improve its management
system, including:

> Organisational issues, relying on
the Security Committee to perform
a coordination and monitoring role
with regard to security activities;

> Verification, updating and mon-
itoring of the policies and opera-
tional procedures adopted, includ-
ing the two internal procedures for
Disaster Recovery and Incident and
Problem Management;

> Adoption of new technologies in
the cybersecurity area;

> Stipulation of a specific insurance
policy to cover cyber risks;

> Monitoring specific risk indicators
(also using a third-party Cyber Secu-
rity Rating system);

> Monitoring the risk of information
security with third parties;

>Vulnerability assessment and
penetration test activities, carried
out both with company tools and the
skills of internal resources, and by
assigning the activities to specialized
external companies;

> Continuous technological upgrad-
ing activities to ensure the updat-
ing of the IT system and reduce ob-
solescence;

> Maintenance and testing of a Dis-
aster Recovery system, which du-
plicates the production farm and
guarantees the alignment of data,
ensuring business continuity in the
event of catastrophic events.

Data security and protection is one
of Cerved Group's priorities, which

has information protection programs,
specialised personnel responsible for
supervising the systems and periodic
training plans. The IT security systems
operate according to three principles
defined Availability, Integrity and
Confidentiality, implemented with
control systems aimed at preventing:

> data loss (backup, systems redun-
dancy), or alteration of the same
(antivirus, Web/URL filtering);

> access to IT systems from the out-
side (anti-intrusion systems, fire-
walls, WAF, encryption, HTTPS);

> unexpected access to IT systems
by unauthorised internal personnel
(authentication systems, access poli-
cies, management of system admin-
istrators according to the current
regulatory requirements - Privileged
Access Management PAM).

The Cerved Group's IT system oper-
ates through two data centers locat-
ed in Italy, in Padua and Cosenza.

> Padua: the data center located in
Padua is dedicated to production
systems, i.e. those systems that
guarantee the production and provi-
sion processes of customer services,
as well as data storage and man-
agement activities. The data center
in Padua uses redundant systems,
which allow immediate interven-
tions to guarantee the operational
continuity of the Cerved Group.

> Cosenza: the data center in the
province of Cosenza is home to the
Disaster Recovery systems which
allow the restoration of the Cerved
Group's operations within 24 hours,
as well as the environments in which
development and testing activities
take place.

The Cerved Group has two other data
centers in Milan and Turin, connected
via an integrated computer network to
the main data centers. They host the
systems and applications relating to
the production and provision of ser-
vices of the recently acquired Cerved
Group companies.
