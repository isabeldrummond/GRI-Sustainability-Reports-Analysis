Cerved’s Corporate Governance structure follows an
organisational and management model based on ethical values
and characterised by absolute respect of the norms and rules of
conduct in effect within the company.

The Board of Directors has exclusive
jurisdiction over the administrative
and strategic management of the
Group for the achievement of the cor-
porate objectives; 64% of the Direc-
tors are men and 36% are women?,
with 27% of Directors aged between
30 and 50 years old*, and 73% more
than 50 years old. The Board of Direc-
tors is responsible for approving all
useful and/or necessary and/or relat-
ed activities, in any case preparatory
to the preparation and publication
of the Sustainability Report for the
entire Cerved Group, including the

arising from business activities and
