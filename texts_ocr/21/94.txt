of specific clusters regarding the ter-
ritory, the industrial environment and
the life phases of businesses.

Capitalising different data storage
technologies, the Group is develop-
ing projects aimed at exploiting the
most innovative products. Specifically,
Cerved has 18 of the top 30 database
models in production worldwide and
uses paradigms that include all of the
new frameworks (such as Hadoop)
and allow fast processing even of
non-structured data.

Extremely complex methodologies
and solutions provide Cerved with an
incredible competitive advantage.
An example is the Neo4j technolo-
gy, also called “graph based”, which
makes it possible to develop algo-
rithms at a reasonable cost and with
superior performance. Also in this
area, the Group developed Graph4yY-
ou, an innovative platform that, using
the API (Application Programming In-
terface) ecosystem, enables Cerved to
formulate data analyses in a massive
and fast way, including not only a sin-
gle company or person but a whole se-
ries of existing relationships between
a plurality of different parties.

By adopting DevOps models”, a set
of practices supported by automated
and Lean Management tools, Cerved
introduced new automation pro-
cesses for the software production
and release chain, enabling customers
to expect secure and high quality ap-
plications delivered much more quick-
ly. Special attention paid to the API
(Application Programming Interface)
ecosystem enables Cerved to simplify
the dialogue between applications.
A strong integration and information
exchange component makes for fast-
er accesses, while ensuring the scala-
bility, control and flexibility of the de-
veloped application platforms.

Thanks to this system of application
interfaces, Cerved allows a_ select
group of developers and Fintech?' to
access its data for the purpose of cre-
ating new programs and services.
