» Health and Safety

This issue is addressed through or-
ganisational measures consistent
with Italian Legislative Decree no.
81/2008 (Consolidated Law on Occu-
pational Health and Safety), as sub-
sequently amended. A Risk Assess-
ment Document is prepared for each
Group company, consistent with reg-
ulations and company structures. In
this regard, the Group’s Supervisory
Bodies carry out verification and
monitoring activities periodically, to
the extent of their competency. In ad-
dition, meetings are held at least once
a year with the members of first aid
and fire-fighting teams to review the
main critical issues and implement ap-
propriate corrective actions.

Lists of the members of the emer-
gency teams and the emergency and
evacuation plans, designed to achieve
proper handling of safety issues at
all locations, are posted on the com-
pany’s Intranet. The prevention initia-
tives mentioned above are supported
by constant attention to the manda-
tory training required by Italian Leg-
islative Decree no. 81/08, concerning
the protection of employee health
and safety and the training of emer-
gency teams.

COORDINATION BETWEEN
THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK

Coordination between the parties

tween them, with a view to efficiency
and full mutual integration.

The Director in charge and the mem-

tors are invited to attend the meetings
of the Control, Risk and Sustainability
Committee, as required by relevant

lative Decree 231/2001.

Other persons who are not members
of the Control, Risk and Sustainabil-
ity Committee may also attend the
meetings if they are requested to do
so by the Committee. These persons
provide information and give relevant
assessments on aspects of the Con-
trol and Risk System, according to the
items on the agenda. The Internal Au-
dit Manager also attends Committee
meetings as secretary.
