Corporate Governance and
organisational structure

Cerved’s Corporate Governance struc-
ture is based on the traditional admin-
istration and control model referred
to in articles 2380-bis et seg. of the
Italian Civil Code, according to which,
without prejudice to the mandatory
powers of the Shareholders’ Meeting:
> the Board of Directors is exclusive-
ly responsible for the Company's
administrative and strategic man-
agement in pursuit of the corporate
purpose;
>the Board of Statutory Auditors
is responsible for supervising ob-
servance of the law and the Articles
of Association, compliance with the
principles of good administration
and, especially, the adequacy of the
Company's organisational, adminis-
trative and accounting structure;
> the legal auditing of the Group's ac-
counts is entrusted to Independent
Auditors entered in the official reg-
ister.

The Board of Directors performs its
activities directly and collectively, as
well as by delegating part of its duties
to the Chairman and the Chief Exec-
utive Officer, as permitted by the law
and the Articles of Association.

The Board of Directors also includes:

>the Remuneration and Nomina-
tions Committee;

> the Related Parties Committee;

> the Control, Risk and Sustainabili-
ty Committee.

In accordance with the provisions of
the Corporate Governance Code of

Governance model includes an In-

ternal Auditing Function that is in
charge of checking that the internal
control and risk management sys-
tem is adequate and functioning
as prescribed. Lastly, the Group's
administration and control model is
completed with the activities of the
Supervisory Body, established fol-
lowing the adoption of the Organisa-
tion, Management and Control Model
pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree
no. 231/2001.
