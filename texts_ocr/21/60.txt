Whoever makes a report through
this system is protected by the
Group, even when the report, although
unfounded, is based on good faith and
reasonableness; in the event of a vi-
olation, a special disciplinary proce-
dure is set up. The System Manager",
in fact, with the support of the Human
Resources Function, monitors any re-
taliatory, unfair and/or discriminatory
behaviour against the whistleblowers
through the analysis and overall as-
sessment of specific “Red Flags”’®.

If whistleblowers believe they have
suffered retaliatory conduct as a re-
sult of a report they have made, they
are invited by the Group to submit a
new report on the retaliation suffered.
In such cases, the Group ensures that

the System Manager will immediately
investigate the matter together with
the functions involved in the facts de-
scribed.

Two reports’ were received in 2019
related to the Whistleblowing Man-
agement System implemented by
the Company. These reports were re-
ceived and managed by the System
Manager (who carried out the pre-
paratory investigative activities) and
subsequently by the relevant internal
departments.

> Report n.1: action was taken by the
competent functions;

> Report n. 2: analysis and assessment
activities are still under way.

Privacy policy & GDPR compliance

Data collection, analysis and processing are the very
foundation of the products and services offered by the Group.
In this context, the protection of privacy is a particularly
relevant issue which permeates all business processes ina

transverse manner.

On 23 December 2019 the Board of
Directors of Cerved Group approved
the Group's General Personal Data
Processing Policy (Privacy Policy). The
document provides details on the or-
ganisation of the roles, tasks and
responsibilities involved in the pro-
tection of Personal Data, with par-
ticular reference to bodies, functions,
areas and business units, procedures
and provisions adopted for the pro-
tection of data.

The Group adopted a Privacy Manage-

ment and Control organisational mod-
el that, by clearly mapping the tasks,
roles and responsibilities of each per-
son in accordance with the accounta-
bility principle, officially establishes

model, Cerved renewed and fine-
