models based on current regulations:

> Enasarco agents have a remunera-
tion model based on commissions
which consists of a variable percent-
age of the contract value, established
according to the characteristics of
the contract itself. This agent cate-
gory provides an incentive system
in two parts: annual targets and pre-
miums on characteristic dimensions
of the business, and targets and pre-
miums for time periods of less than
one year (typically a quarter).

>The employees have a remunera-
tion model based on a fixed GAC,
while the incentive model has exact-
ly the same characteristics as that
used with the Enasarco agents.
Every year the remuneration and in-
centive models undergo adjustments
which are aimed at creating consist-
ency between business evolution
and the conduct expected from
agents and increasingly rewarding the
best sales performance.

TOP MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION
PLANNING

In 2019, the Board of Directors
launched a Succession Planning pro-
cess through the Remuneration and
Nominations Committee. The process
currently focuses on the first reports
of the Chief Executive Officer and
was designed to safeguard business
management stability, reduce pro-
spective risks associated with the lack
of managerial continuity in top man-
agement positions, and avoid possible
impact, including reputational impact,
on the Company. In particular, the
process was divided into 3 phases:

> in-depth interviews with the first
reports on their perception of the
role held and of organisational de-
velopment, in order to identify po-
tential successors and highlight risk
levels;

> analysis of potential successors
based on three classifications: back-
up candidate, successor at 12 - 24
months, next generation at 36-60
months;

> creation of a so-called “Succession
Mapping”.

This allowed a virtuous process to

be built that guarantees stability and

business continuity.
