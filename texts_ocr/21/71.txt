CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

A buddy for
each new hire

the opportunity to take part in group
dynamics to highlight their relational
skills and critical thinking abilities.

The employee selection phase is cru-
cial, as is their actual inclusion in the
company. For this reason, a struc-
tured onboarding process was de-
veloped to help people who begin
working with the Group to smoothly
and quickly settle into their new work
environment during the early months
of employment, and to broaden their
networks and understanding of the
Cerved culture. A Welcome Event,
which is attended by all new employ-
ees on their first day of work, includes
an overview of the company, a de-
tailed description of the onboarding
process and administrative issues, as
well as a presentation of the benefits
and services offered.

Each new hire is then assigned a bud-
dy, i.e. a Cerved employee preferably
from another structure/division who
will support the person during the
early onboarding stages. Buddies are
recruited through a Call 4 volunteer
on the Workplace platform where all
Cerved employees were able to apply,
showing great enthusiasm for the in-
itiative and the wish to make connec-
tions with new colleagues.

The search for ideal candidates takes
place not only externally, but also
within the Group itself, with a view to
enhancing and developing the tal-
ent of our people. In fact, thanks to
the Internal Job Posting Brain - found-
ed on the principles of transparency
and meritocracy - Cerved employees
can apply for open positions at the
company, becoming protagonists
of their own growth. Brain is also an
enabler for the contamination of
ideas, knowledge and skills transver-
sal to the entire group, and for the
diffusion of a culture of feedback and
professional development. The acqui-
sition of new businesses and Cerved’s
greater presence in countries other
than Italy boosted opportunities for
exchange and participation in inter-
national projects, helping to create an

increasingly inclusive culture of diver-
sity.

A new Exit Interview process was
launched in the second half of 2019.
An online form and subsequent face-
to-face meeting with HR were used to
measure and understand the reasons
behind the decision to leave Cerved,
both generally and by specific area,
and an overview of the resigning
employee’s journey was collected
to gather ideas for improvement. The
Exit Interview is available in Italian,
English and Romanian, meaning that
it may be applied at cross-country lev-
el.

CERVED NEXT CAMPUS AS A GOOD
EXAMPLE OF EMPLOYER BRANDING

Employer Branding is certainly a
strategic lever to better position
Cerved in the labour market. Several
projects were developed in 2019 to
raise awareness of the environment
and opportunities that the company
offers to recent graduates and stu-
dents about to graduate.

A combination of Employer Branding,
recruitment activities and information
about Cerved blended into Cerved
Next Campus, an event focused on
young talents, within the framework
of the broader insight provided by
Cerved Next, the largest national
event on data driven economy. In
2019, 23 people took part in the initia-
tive, selected not on the basis of their
CV or graduation mark, but through
a digital challenge that tested their
mindset and knowledge of the digital
world. During the event, candidates
were asked to become Cerved profes-
sionals for one day, working as a team
on a real case focused on our prod-
ucts. The solutions were presented to
a jury composed of Managers from
different areas of Cerved. Many of
those participants now work inside
the Group: a strong signal that shows
how important and effective Employ-
er Branding is.
