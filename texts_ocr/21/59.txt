The Cerved Group conducts its business with loyalty, fairness,
transparency, honesty, integrity and in compliance with laws,
regulations and rules in general, with standards and guidelines,
both national and international, which apply to the Group’s

activities.

In this regard, the Group promotes
the adoption of instruments aimed
at preventing, detecting and com-
municating unlawful conduct and/
or conduct in violation of the ethical
principles advocated by the Group,
such as the Whistleblowing Manage-
ment System which has the following
characteristics:
> it is a multi-channel system, which
also includes a web platform, entire-
ly separate and independent from
the Group's information systems,
which allows whistleblowing re-
ports to be made from any device,
easily and in an entirely confidential
manner, ensuring the protection of
the whistleblower's personal details;
> it is a unified system for the entire
Cerved Group;
> it ensures high levels of confiden-
tiality of the information and of the
identity of the whistleblower and the
person against whom the report is
made.

The acts or facts that are the subject

of reports may concern the following

aspects:

> violations of the Group’s Code of
Ethics:

> unlawful conduct, pursuant to Ital-
ian Legislative Decree 231/2001 and
violations of the Model 231 adopted
by Group companies;

>violations of the procedures
adopted by Group companies;

> violations of the Corporate Gov-
ernance Code for Listed Companies
prepared by the Corporate Govern-
ance Committee of Borsa Italiana;

> business integrity issues (such as
theft, misconduct in business man-
agement, corruption, improper use
of company resources, detrimental
events involving customers, conflicts
of interest);

> financial integrity issues (e.g., in-
sider trading, accounting violations,
corporate fraud, etc.);

> violations of anti-money launder-
ing regulations;

> violations of banking regulations.

The Board of Directors of Cerved decid-
ed to adopt this system, including the
specific “Procedure for the use and
management of the whistleblowing
system”, on 29 October 2018. Grad-
ually, all the other Group companies
adopted the system through a specif-
ic board resolution. The procedure is
available on the company’s website in
the “Investor Relations & ESG” section.
In order to make the system high-
ly visible and accessible, it has been
made available, in Italian and English,
on the website in the Governance Sec-
tion, Whistleblowing area. Software
updating activities were carried out
in 2019 to include a number of im-
provements: during update, specific
communication was delivered to all
Group employees on the purpose of
the system in order to increase their
awareness of the tool and its features.
Awareness training'* sessions are the
“formal” occasion during which people
can ask for support on ethical behav-
iour, being trained, and receive details
about this reporting tool.
