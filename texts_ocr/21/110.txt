EDUCATING AND DISSEMINATING
FINANCIAL CULTURE

The Cerved Group Research De-
partment (Ufficio Studi) conducts
analyses and research on the Italian
economic system. These studies are
fundamental cultural capital based on
data and technology. Cerved makes
them available to the national eco-
nomic system to help it grow in a sus-
tainable way, as stated in the Purpose.
The studies are primarily intended for
the private system and institutions
to support them in strategic deci-
sion-making processes or in the defi-
nition of public policies, with a view to
sustainability.

The work of the Research Depart-
ment is based on the broadest and
most accurate financial and com-
mercial information system, with a
historical depth that is difficult to rep-
licate, and available for free on the
portal know.cerved.com.
