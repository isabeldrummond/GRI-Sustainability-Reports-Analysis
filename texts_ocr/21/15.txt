OUR DISTINCTIVE FEATURES

The Cerved Group's databases offer
a wealth of information unique in
Italy in terms of quality, complete-
ness and historical depth. A depth
that shows the trend of events over
time and tells the stories of business-
es, groups and individuals. The Cerved
Group has an advanced technologi-
cal structure with sophisticated elec-
tronic systems developed internally
for the automated processing of data.
This structure makes it possible to ex-
tract information very quickly and
process data efficiently and accurate-
ly, also thanks to advanced algorithms.

checked and corrected, they are
managed in a centralised database
where they are reprocessed, both
automatically using sophisticated
matching and verification algorithms
and manually by qualified operators,
who analyse the information extract-
ed from the system and reprocess it

rate assessments of the financial sus-
tainability and risk profiles of current
and potential counterparties.
