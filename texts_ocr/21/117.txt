d Data Driven Competition

Cardo, a tech company for institu-
tional investors, is the winner of the
Data Driven Competition: the first
challenge launched by Fintech Dis-
trict, a start-up community based in
Milan that offers itself as a gateway
to the Italian Fintech ecosystem, and
Cerved, with the aim of identifying
new companies capable of develop-
ing innovative products and servic-
es in this field. In addition to the data,
the competition is based on Cerved's
economic and financial information
on over 6 million Italian companies
which are supplied through APIs (Ap-
plication Programming Interface).
Insofar as relations with the Italian
Public Administration are concerned,
Cerved developed the Cerved PA Por-
tal, a vertical portal that offers infor-
mation on entities that operate in and
for the Public Administration sector.
Responsible management of the rela-
tions with institutions and the Public
Administration is a strategic priority
for the Group.

It should be noted that in 2019, com-
pliant with the Code of Ethics and the
Organizational Model 231, the Group
did not receive funding from the Pub-
lic Administration or Governments,
neither made political contributions.
