CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

ents and improved user experience
through the introduction of an inno-
vative platform with a wide range of
products: from the reimbursement
of instruction, transport and welfare
costs, to the purchase of vouchers, lei-
sure packages, travel reservation and
other products, in compliance with
the relevant regulations.

Corporate Welfare was developed in
2019 and included two different plans:
a plan for the conversion of the per-
formance bonus (already available in
2018) and a Welfare on top plan, in-
troduced in 2019, for the Groupâ€™s Ex-
ecutives and Managers (Quadri).

With the first plan, the people des-

ignated as recipients of the perfor-
> 30.000 mance bonus were given the option of
either allocating it to Welfare, thus in-
creasing their buying power, or asking
that it be disbursed through the pay
slip. The results were extremely posi-
tive, with a bonus conversion rate of

for welfare services increased by 11%.
The introduction of an increase in the
bonus was also appreciated, encour-

to 6.5% increase for those converting

the entire bonus).

All welfare process information was
shared with users within the Work-
place group, where it was possible to
ask questions and report any prob-
lems. During the period of use, users
were supported by HR staff.

A survey was launched at the end of
the process asking for feedback on
the process, in order to assess what
had been done and gather sugges-
tions and reports to improve the pro-
