RESPONSIBLE MARKETING AND
THE CODE OF CONDUCT IN DEBT
COLLECTION

The Cerved Group's basis for success
is a solid reputation, which custom-
ers rely on to assess creditworthiness,
monitor and manage credit risk during
all its phases, define marketing strate-
gies accurately and evaluate and man-
age bad loans. On 13 March 2020, the
Board of Directors approved the new
Responsible Marketing Policy, avail-
able on the corporate website in the
“Investor Relations & ESG” section, ac-
cording to which employees and peo-
ple who work for Cerved are required
to do their job in the customer's
interest, ensuring a level of trans-
parency in commercial relations that
simultaneously ensures full under-
standing of the characteristics, func-
tioning and contractual conditions
of the products and services offered,
including costs, commissions and, in
general, any other charge relating to
products and services offered.

The contracts signed with customers
and every communication addressed
to them are therefore based on crite-
ria of:

i) Prudency and Accuracy

All the content intended for ex-
ternal stakeholders and conveyed
through the means of communi-
cation used - including advertising
messages relating to products and
services offered by third parties
- are defined and transmitted fol-
lowing adequate verification. All
advertising activities are subjected
to internal revisions to verify con-
formity and accuracy.

Reliability and Truth

All promotional and marketing ac-
tivities are carefully planned while
ensuring that inconsistent person-
al initiatives are excluded. All the
content communicated is verified
and does not contain oversized
claims, universal and hyperbolic
assertions and comparisons that
cannot be demonstrated and lack
an evident objective basis.

El Honesty and Transparency
The information must be clear
and truthful about any risk as-
sociated with our products, in ac-
cordance with industry practices
and relevant requirements, and
must also include all communica-
tions necessary for the customer
