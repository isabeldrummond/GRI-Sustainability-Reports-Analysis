APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS,
VOTING LIST AND PROTECTION
OF SHAREHOLDERS

The Articles of Association provide
that the directors shall be appoint-
ed by the Shareholders’ Meeting, in
compliance with applicable pro tem-
pore regulations on gender balance,
according to lists submitted by the
shareholders which contain a maxi-
mum of fifteen candidates who meet
the requirements of the law and reg-
ulations in force at the time and who

of age.

During 2019, the Board of Directors
met 27 times with an average du-
ration of each meeting of approxi-
mately 3 hours and 30 minutes. The
number and duration of meetings
increased compared to the previous
year. This reveals, therefore, growing
attention, focus and openness to-
wards Cerved Group's business man-
agement issues by Board of Director
members.
