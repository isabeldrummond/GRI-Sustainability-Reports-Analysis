Purpose and principles

The Group's corporate Purpose and key mission is to “help
the national economic system protect itself from risk and
sustainably grow”. This mission is achieved by “putting data,
technologies and talent at the service of people, businesses,

banks and institutions”.

The Purpose stems from the true need
to support technological innovation
by relaunching Italian productivi-
ty with data-driven innovation, a
crucial tool for reversing the normal
trends of economic stagnation while
ensuring sustainable growth with pos-
itive impacts on the community.
These impacts consist of:
> educating and disseminating fi-
nancial culture;
> supporting the legislative and
economic decisions of the Italian
economic system;
> improving the financial integrity
and transparency of the nation-
al banking and economic system,
increasing awareness of the struc-
ture and dynamics of the markets
in which companies operate and en-
couraging loan disbursement.
Aware of its important social role,
Cerved has undertaken a journey to
extensively incorporate sustainability
principles and actions into its busi-
ness strategy and daily activities. It
strives to strengthen its commitment
to spreading the concept of sustain-
ability and of the creation of shared
value in all corporate departments,

tion levels and boosting the culture of

tainability drives a process of con-
tinuous improvement; a_ process

strengthens economic performance,
reputation and workers’ health and
safety, and allows environmental and
social goals to be achieved. Fair, trans-
parent and responsible behaviour

protecting them over time. They are
at the basis of a sustainable business
development that seeks to create and
protect value for all its stakeholders.
To pursue the Purpose and create syn-
ergies with all stakeholders, whether
internal or external, the Group has
aligned its ideals and merged guide-
lines, ideas, tools and tangible busi-
ness elements into four principles:
