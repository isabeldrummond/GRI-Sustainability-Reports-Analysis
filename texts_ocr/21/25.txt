CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

 

Cerved’s new approach
to Sustainability

Aware of its important social role, Cerved has undertaken a
journey to extensively incorporate sustainability principles and
actions into its business strategy and daily activities.

From
awareness
to action

Cerved operates in the belief that sus-
tainability drives the process towards
continuous improvement, a process
that guarantees long-term results,
strengthens economic performance,
reputation and workers’ health and
safety, and allows environmental and
social goals to be achieved.
In 2019, the Group embarked on a
journey of growth and in-depth
study of sustainability topics. The
starting point was gaining awareness
of its position, analysing the percep-
tion that main stakeholders have of
the Group and implementing their
feedback by turning it into a practical
action plan.
To do this, Cerved provided itself with
appropriate organisational and gov-
ernance tools to achieve its sustain-
ability goals. It drew inspiration from
the Code of Ethics and the principles
established by the UN, and aligned it-
self with international best practices.
The main measures taken in 2019
were:
> Increasing the number of stake-
holders involved in stakeholder en-
gagement in order to identify mate-
rial topics;
> Conducting a gap-analysis on
sustainability topics not sufficient-
ly monitored in the past in order to
identify improvement actions;
> Adopting sustainability manage-
ment and reporting methods ap-
propriate to market trends, stake-
holder expectations and investors’
needs;
> Establishing the internal board com-
mittee Risk Control and Sustaina-

bility Committee;

> Appointing the ESG Manager who
reports directly to the Chief Execu-
tive Officer and is assisted in his/her
duties by the Work Group composed
of the Executive Management Com-
mittee;

> Appointing the Sustainability Am-
bassadors;

> Drafting the Group Sustainabil-
ity Policy and six new corporate
policies - Human Rights, Environ-
mental, Community Support, Priva-
cy, Responsible Marketing and Anti
Money Laundering - which set the
guidelines for managing the mate-
rial topics identified by stakeholder
engagement;

> Setting up a dedicated section on
the corporate website for sustaina-
bility topics in the Investor Relations
section;

> Improving the quality and fre-
quency of engagement with ESG
rating agencies;

> Confirming Cerved Group's sup-
port to the UN Global Compact
programme, moving from “signato-
ry” to “participant”;

> Defining a Sustainability Plan as
part of the broader Sustainability
Strategy.
