INPS BIG DATA ANALYTICS

On 7 May 2019, the workshop “Big Data in the Public Administration” was held in the
headquarters of Palazzo Wedekind in Rome, organised in collaboration with Cerved
Group. The event was promoted by Cerved in collaboration with INPS (National Insti-
tute of Social Insurance). They have collaborated since 2018 to make Cerved's data on
the financial statements of all Italian capital companies available on VisitINPS Scholar.
By combining INPS and Cerved databases it is possible to develop analyses with a
remarkable level of detail on a plurality of economic, political and social issues by
relating granular data taken from INPS services and data on trends in the production
system taken from companies’ financial statements. It is also possible to detail the in-
formation at sector and territory level and possibly enrich it with semantic web tools

DEFINITION OF BUSINESS INFORMATION INDUSTRY STANDARDS
Together with the trade association ANCIC (National Association of Business Infor-
mation and Credit Management Companies), Cerved, which also sits on the board
of directors of the association, is among the main promoters of the definition of
the Code of Deontology and Good Conduct for the processing of personal data
carried out for commercial information purposes, and participates in the work table
to define the industry standard on the subject.

SCIENTIFIC PARTNERSHIP WITH CNDCEC
In May 2019, Cerved was chosen by the National Council of Chartered Accountants
and Accounting Experts (CNDCEC) as a scientific partner of the work table that will
define the indicators with which warning procedures are activated. Cerved has large
databases relating to the business world and specific and methodological skills that
allow it to identify statistically significant indicators, also taking into account the par-
ticular characteristics of the companies (size, product sector, year of incorporation).

Created on a half-yearly basis and available on the ABI (Italian Banking Association)
website, the ABI-Cerved Outlook disseminates estimates and forecasts of bad loan
entry rates of non-financial companies by size class, with the aim of expanding the
pool of information available on the national economic fabric.

of Cerved Rating Agency and analysts
will be fundamental.
