CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

practices and into the development of a more sustainable global financial system.

Alongside the innovations introduced in 2019, we decided to publish a body

of policies that encloses the Group's commitments on ESG issues, including a
Sustainability Policy, a Human Rights Policy, an Environmental Policy, an Anti Money
Laundering Policy, a Responsible Marketing Policy and a Community Support Policy.
Lastly, we decided to formalise our goals in a Sustainability Strategy able to combine
the Groupâ€™s commitments with goals and targets defined at ESG level and linked to
the achievement of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE

The spreading of COVID-19 in the first months of 2020 has affected the global
economy. The impact that it will have on the Italian system is difficult to assess

at the moment, but it will certainly lead to greater uncertainty and risks which

will affect economic activities. During the weak phases of the economic cycle, our
services will become even more essential to limit financial contagion. Already in the
past, in fact, our business model was able to grow during recent periods of recession
(both in 2008/2009 and 2012/2013), revealing its distinctive feature: resilience.

Thanks to careful and immediate crisis management - aimed at protecting the
health of our people, implementing business continuity practices and strengthening
smartworking systems - the company is reacting well to the emergency.

To live up to our promise, especially in times of crisis, and help the national
economic system to protect itself from risk and make decisions based on the best
available information, a study regarding the effects of the emergency on various
sectors and the impact on default rates has been made available to the financial
community. The study is available free of charge on our Cerved Know platform.

Despite the difficult economic phase, we are confident in Cerved's ability to continue
its growth path with increasing attention to sustainability issues.

We look towards the future with confidence, in the belief that if we maintain a
shared vision at Group level and strive together for continuous improvement, we will

then be able to grow and create greater shared value for our stakeholders.
