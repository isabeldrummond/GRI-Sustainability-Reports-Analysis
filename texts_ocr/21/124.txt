Our approach to
the environment

Although the Group operates in sectors that have a limited
environmental impact, with its conduct it wants to contribute to
sustainable development in the country, which is also respectful

of the natural environment.

For this reason, Cerved is committed
to containing any significant envi-
ronmental impacts generated by its
operating activities, in particular de-
riving from the use of buildings and
infrastructures and from personnel
transport.To formalise its commit-

ment to environmental protection, a
new Group Environmental Policy
was drawn up in 2019, submitted for
the approval of the Company's Board
of Directors on 13 March 2020 and
published on the corporate website in
the “Investor Relations & ESG” section.

Within the Environmental Policy,
Cerved has formalised its commit-
ment to wanting to reduce emissions
into the atmosphere deriving from
the travel of its personnel, acting both
qualitatively on the mix of applied
solutions and quantitatively on the
sizing of needs.

To this end, the actions taken were:

> initiatives promoting the use of rail
transport®® in the areas served;

> progressive renewal of the compa-
ny fleet with low emission vehicles;

> introduction of collective transport
incentive tools and for public trans-
portation;

> adoption and extension of smart
working.

To support its commitments, the

Group has adopted internal proce-
dures for the organisation of busi-
ness trips, with the following indica-
tions:

> travel for work should normally be
done with public transport (train,
plane, underground, etc.), using the
method that allows optimising the
cost/benefit ratio;

>in general travel between various
company offices in the same city
should give precedence to the use
of the underground (if any), buses
or trams;

> trips must be organised within the
defined limits and seeking to opti-
mise logistical and organisational
aspects.

In addition, the Group plans to ap-
prove a new Car Policy which will

for business trips.
