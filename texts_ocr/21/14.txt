Overview of the Cerved Group

THE CERVED GROUP AND ITS
BUSINESS AREAS

Drawing on a unique wealth of data,
evaluation models, innovative tech-
nological solutions, and a team of ex-
perts and analysts, the Cerved Group
(“Cerved” or the “Group”) every day
helps companies, public administra-
tions and financial institutions man-
age the opportunities and the risks
of their business relationships.
Cerved supports customers in plan-
ning and implementing commercial
and marketing strategies and sup-
ports them in all stages of a loan’s life
as a leading independent operator in
the assessment and management of
performing and non performing loans
and related assets.

With the acquisition of MBS Consult-
ing, the Group has strengthened its
position in strategic consulting and
advanced analytics services and has
created the first solution consulting
group in Italy.

prise three key business segments:

> Credit Management

Cerved helps its customers protect
themselves from credit risk by provid-

and financial profiles, the reliability
of companies and individuals, and
to assess the riskiness of the entire
credit portfolio, in order to support
customers in defining assessment
models and decision-making sys-

tions developed internally by the
subsidiary Spazio Dati;

> Rating & Analytics: services to
measure the credit worthiness of

The services include specialist exper-

ceedings, through to remarketing
personal property and real estate.
Cerved helps to identify highly effec-
tive solutions throughout the loan's
entire life cycle in order to take quick,
professional action and so reduce the
time it takes to return the money.
