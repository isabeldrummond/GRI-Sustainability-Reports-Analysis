The Human Resources Department
carries out its activities in full com-
pliance with the principles of inclu-
sion and equality that distinguish the
Group. In 2019, Cerved Group's fe-
male workers accounted for 61% of
the total workforce, recording a 1.3%
reduction in the overall Gender Pay
Gap calculated on base salary from
2018 to 2019. In 2020, several initia-
tives will foster pay gap reduction, in
line with the commitments defined
in the Group's sustainability plan and
according to the principles of the Unit-
ed Nations Global Compact which the
Group has joined.

In Cerved, the role of HR Business
Partner is a major reference point
which employees can turn to for re-
porting any episode of discrimination
or harassment, with the assurance of
utmost confidentiality and protection;
furthermore, the Labour Law & Indus-
trial Relations team may be involved
in the management of these cases.

In 2019, the open group “Diversity
Matters” was launched on the cor-
porate social collaboration platform
Workplace, which can be joined by all
employees and associates who are on

the platform and which currently has
160 expanding members. The aim of
this virtual community is to dissemi-
nate content, through the participa-
tion and posts of all members, aimed
at enhancing any type of diversity,
including gender, disability, LGBT.
Seeking to create contamination, ina
positive sense, the Community helps
raise awareness and break down prej-
udice by building an increasingly
inclusive culture. The launch of the
group is also the basis for a project
to raise awareness of diversity & in-
clusion issues throughout the organ-
isation. Training will be delivered to
managers on “unconscious bias”,
which will focus on enhancing the
skills of people with disabilities, and a
female empowerment programme
will be developed. With this aim, in
2019 Cerved started to cooperate with
one of the first companies in the world
capable of enhancing the special skills
of people suffering from autism, As-
perger’s syndrome and similar disor-
ders, in order to search for candidates
for their inclusion in the Group.

In keeping with its Code of Ethics and
Human Rights Policy, the Group is
