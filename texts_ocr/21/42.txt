on the Company. In particular, the

process was divided into 3 phases:

> in-depth interviews with the first
reports on their perception of the
role held and of organisational de-
velopment, in order to identify po-
tential successors and highlight risk
levels;

> analysis of potential successors
based on three classifications: back-
up candidate, successor at 12 - 24
months, next generation at 36-60
months;

> creation of a so-called “Succession
Mapping”.

This allowed a virtuous process to

be built that guarantees stability and

business continuity.
