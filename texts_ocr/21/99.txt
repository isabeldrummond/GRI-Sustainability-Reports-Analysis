As for the Credit Collection activity,
Cerved Credit Management Group
has adopted a Code of Conduct for
credit recovery through which it is
committed, and commits its associ-
ates, to respect consumer rights and
human rights. In line with the rules
established in the UNIREC (National
Union for Credit Protection Compa-
nies) Code of Conduct for Credit Man-
agement and Protection Processes,
the Group has dedicated a section of
its Human Rights Policy to this activity.
Cerved is committed to ensuring that

credit management always takes
place with the aim of embarking on
a path of dialogue with the debt-
or aimed at fully understanding the
causes of insolvency and identifying
possible solutions. The activity is car-
ried out while respecting the dignity
and honourability of the debtor and
ensuring that agents behave in a way
that does not create embarrassment
or generate pressure, for example by
using false titles or threatening tones,
by proposing unreal or unenforceable
consequences in the specific case or
by qualifying themselves as officials
reporting directly to the Client/Cred-
itor. The person responsible for the
activity must not disclose the content
of the cases entrusted to third par-
ties and/or use what he/she learns
for personal purposes. In 2019, there
were no cases of non-compliance with
the regulations and/or self-regula-
tion codes regarding information on
services, nor with regulations and/or
voluntary codes relating to marketing
activities (including advertising).
