Use of resources and waste

management

In line with its Environmental Policy, Cerved is committed to
reducing the consumption of non-renewable materials or of high
environmental impact, in particular through the containment

of paper consumption through projects for document

dematerialisation and the reduction of the use of disposable food-

grade plastic that is not biodegradable within company offices.

By investing in dematerialisation
and digital technologies of the latest
generation, Cerved has in fact signif-
icantly reduced the use of paper. In
this sense, the Group’s information
database was also revised: the switch
from the Oracle operating system
to the Graph Neo4j platform (totally
transactional database integrated into
the applications) contributed to fur-
ther savings in the use of paper mate-
rials, guaranteeing more sustainable
business development.

To sensitize the entire Group on
increasingly urgent green issues, we
have also embarked on a wide-rang-
ing path that starts from the reduc-
tion of the use of disposable food-
grade plastic: a path oriented to the
sustainable growth of the national
economic system, and which seeks
to induce people to gradually change
their daily behaviours in order to
waste and pollute less and less, be-
coming responsible and careful con-
sumers.

The “Anche NO!” campaign seeks to
oppose all those irresponsible atti-
tudes for our planet, and has been
launched with several actions: bottle
distribution to all employees, in-
stallation of dispensers for the free
distribution of microfiltered water,
replacement of plastic cups with
compostable ones, elimination of
plastic in canteens, up to the choice
of locations with low environmen-
tal impact for internal, external and

corporate events and green suppli-
ers.

In this regard, communication plays
an important role with the display of
“Anche NO!" posters in the refresh-
ment areas of the corporate offices
and the definition of social cam-
paigns (with dedicated landing page)
which includes the programming of
ad hoc editorial plans on the Group's
channels, addressed externally, and
contents destined for the platform
Workplace with the aim of keeping
internal engagement high.

New initiatives are planned for 2020-
2021 which will put a greater focus on
the issue of recycling up to the near
total refusal of all that is not ecolog-
ical.

The Group has also designed a pro-
ject that will be implemented in 2020
called the “Transparent collection
project”. Separate waste collection
will no longer be in dark containers,
but in transparent containers that al-
low seeing their contents and reduc-
ing human error.

For the disposal and toner collec-
tion service available at all offices, the
Group relies on the ONLUS Vestisoli-
dale cooperative, which is a non-profit
entity that provides personal, environ-
mental and social services, focusing
on employment opportunities for dis-
advantaged individuals.
