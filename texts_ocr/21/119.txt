“® Media relations

tegic guidelines, orientation of Share-
holders’ Meeting votes on Governance
issues and remuneration, managerial
continuity following the appointment
of the new Chief Executive Officer and
updating on strategic alternatives with
reference to the Credit Management
sale.

Advertising and presence on local, regional and national, online
and paper information media is entrusted to an external agency

that functions as a press office.

The advertising strategy aims to
highlight the numerous initiatives
promoted and share the results
achieved, working to bolster brand
awareness, the Group's brand identity
and the personal branding of Cerved’s
top managers.

Information about events, studies, fi-
nancial results, acquisitions and other
particularly significant activities is dis-
seminated by means of press releas-
es or through one-on-one meetings
with newspaper editors.

A total of 82 press releases were is-
sued during the year and the pub-
lic relations activity to consolidate
relations with economic and sector
media and strengthen the Group’s

positioning continued. The high num-
ber of articles (more than 1,500) con-
firms the growing attention by the
press, an engagement by the Group
now firmly established in the territo-
rial and national, specific or scenario
related dynamics and attests to the
acknowledgment of the company’s
role among Italy's main players.
This commitment is bolstered by the
concurrent promotion of all Group
activities planned from time to time,
through in-depth interviews about
specific topics, involving the relevant
managers in different ways. At the
request of journalists, the Group pro-
vides processed data information and
analyses regarding micro and macroe-
conomic developments.
