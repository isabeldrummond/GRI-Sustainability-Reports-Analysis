financial data and information is the
same as that of the consolidation area
used for the Group's consolidated fi-
nancial statements at 31 December
2019. The boundary of the social and
environmental data and information
only excludes Cerved Finline due to
its low incidence in terms of turnover,
employees and type of activity. This
exclusion is therefore not relevant for
the purposes of understanding com-
pany activities, its performance, its re-
sults and the impact it produces. Any
additional limitations of the reporting
boundary are expressly indicated in
the text.

In 2019 there were changes in the
scope of Group consolidation because
on 30 January 2019, the subsidiary
Cerved Credit Management Group
S.r.l. (CCMG) acquired Eurobank Prop-
erty Services S.A. and its subsidiary
Eurobank Property Services S.A. On 3
July 2019 the purchase of Euro Legal
Service S.r.|. was also finalised through
the subsidiary Cerved Credit Manage-
ment Group S.r.I. and lastly on 30 July
2019, Cerved Group signed a binding
agreement for the purchase of a con-
trolling stake in one of the main inde-
pendent Italian management consult-
ing companies, MBS Consulting S.p.A.
(“MBS”) and its subsidiaries.

With reference to these companies,
data starting from the date of in-
corporation of the companies were
therefore included in the reporting
boundary, and more specifically on 1
April 2019 for Cerved Property Servic-
es Single Member S.A. (formerly Eu-
robank Property Services S.A.) and its
subsidiary Cerved Property Services
S.A. (formerly Eurobank Property Ser-
vices S.A.), on 3 July 2019 for Euro Le-
gal Service S.r.l. and finally on 30 July
2019 for MBS Consulting S.p.A. and its
subsidiaries.

REPORTING PROCESS

The information in this Report refers
to 2019 (from 1 January to 31 Decem-
ber 2019) and, in order to allow data
comparability over time and assess

the performance of the Group’s ac-
tivities, offers a comparison with the
two previous years, whenever pos-
sible. An effort was made to mini-
mise as much as possible the use of
estimates, which, when present, are
based on the best available methodol-
ogies and are appropriately flagged. In
2019, the Group refined the consump-
tion detection process by improving
the method for calculating the indi-
cators relating to the GRI Standards
“GRI 302: Energy (2016)” and “GRI 305:
Emissions (2016)”. In order to make
these data comparable with those of
the previous year, the data relating to
2018 has been recalculated with the
methodology defined in 2019, also
for the purpose of greater boundary
completeness. For these indicators,
with reference to the 2018 data, both
the values communicated in the 2018
Sustainability Report and the values
restated with this new method are
published.

As provided for by Italian Legisla-
tive Decree 254/2016, the Statement
is published on an annual basis, is
subject to limited examination in ac-
cordance with the provisions of the
International Standard on Assurance
Engagements (ISAE 3000 Revised) by
PricewaterhouseCoopers S.p.A. The
verification was carried out according
to the procedures indicated in the “In-
dependent Auditors’ Report”.

This document was approved by the
Cerved Group Board of Directors on
13 March 2020. The Sustainability Re-
port 2019, as well as that prepared for
the 2018 fiscal year, is available on the
Group's website in the “Investor Rela-
tions & ESG” section.
