Industrial relations

Industrial Relations are of great importance for the Cerved Group, both

to fulfil the obligations established by law or by the Collective Bargaining
Agreements applied in the Group, and to provide information and consult
with trade union representatives for ordinary management and in

particular situations or when significant organisational changes arise.

Industrial Relations also become in-
creasingly important in terms of the
corporate tradition that considers un-
ion representatives as a significant
interlocutor for the examination of
issues related to business activity.

In addition to the purely organisa-
tional aspects related to personnel
management, the consultations also
concern issues related to work-life
balance (smart working), and welfare
(conversion of results bonuses into
welfare services). The Industrial Rela-
tions activities in the Cerved offices in
Romania offer management support
on issues with organisational or eco-
nomic impacts. The union serves the
role of an informed interlocutor and,
within the perimeter of the legislation,
helps make requests relating to con-
tracts and the economic treatment of
employment relationships, which are
negotiated and possibly implemented
in company agreements.

Thanks to its dedicated HR team, in
2019 the Group sought to further in-
volve the unions, also through a series
of scheduled information, consulta-
tion and negotiation meetings and
through dedicated sessions with the
representatives of Group offices or
companies to address topics of spe-
cific interest. The result of this activity
included a consolidation of welfare
and work-life balance issues, as well
as the coordination of operational
company activities relating to per-
sonnel management, with the aim of
having a positive impact on the inter-
nal climate.

In 2019, the commitment to social

dialogue and the objectives pursued

concerned the management of regu-

latory and contractual institutions of

the employment relationship, includ-

ing, in detail:

> holiday/approved leave through
discussions to determine collective
closure periods;

> working hours and flexibility to
meet the operational needs of spe-
cific functions or to reconcile work-
life balance;

> consolidation and progressive ex-
tension of smart working.

The social dialogue also concerned
the management of certain economic
aspects, in particular sharing criteria
for determining performance bonus-
es based on strengthening value and
the provision of the welfare option as
an alternative to disbursement of the
cash bonus.

The Industrial Relations activities in
Romania continue to be managed by
the Industrial Relations Function of
the Cerved Group Human Resources
department alongside the business
line?>.

The only interlocutors are workers’
representatives, as there is currently
no external union support. They are
managed in relation to specific needs,
with dedicated meetings. The Industri-
al Relations activities serve to ensure
the effective monitoring of regula-
tory issues and personnel manage-
ment on Company operations, with a

perimeters (in
particular Greece
and Switzerland),
as they are not
currently involved.
