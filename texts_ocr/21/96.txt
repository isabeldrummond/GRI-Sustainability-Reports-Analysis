Quality and speed in the development
of products and services are guaran-
teed by a rigorous process guided by

the Group's Marketing Function, car-
ried out in three main phases:

REVIEW: this is the initial phase that requires a detai-
led description of an idea and the involvement of the

° commercial area for the purpose of defining the busi-
e ness case;
e

e FEASIBILITY: this is the phase during which, by ap-

e plying a Service Design approach, customers become
involved already at the design stage, ensuring maxi-
e@ | —=mum responsiveness to their needs and improving ef-

fectiveness, time to market and user experience;

AGILE IMPLEMENTATION: this is the phase in whi-
ch, applying agile logics, full control is guaranteed on
the final product and the development of successive
versions.

In 2019 the Service Design team intro-
duced important additions to make

the work more effective in the 3 phas-
es. The main ones are:

USER RESEARCH: the first phase calls for hearing
from customers and prospects through a series of
interviews and surveys. All of the data collected in the
research phase are then crosschecked with the data in
Cerved's archives;

MULTI-DISCIPLINARY WORKSHOPS: the second
step is aimed at mapping the operational phases of the
service from the user's point of view, both at the system
and interaction level. To that effect, structured workshops
attended by all stakeholders are then organised;

USER TESTING: the third phase, more design process
oriented, includes numerous tests for each new service
section, implemented with the collaboration of some
customers. In specially prepared rooms, users can test
a prototype and are encouraged by a moderator to
describe their experience. This activity makes it possible
to progressively observe the comprehension and
usability level of each new service.
