reduce uncertainty and any infor-

The team organises numerous oppor-
tunities for involvement and commu-
nication with the financial community,
particularly in key corporate mo-
ments such as quarterly results and
the Shareholders’ Meeting. The in-
volvement process involves the iden-
tification of all the relevant events
in which the company intends to par-
ticipate during the year. This includes
participation in conferences organ-
ised by brokers (sell-side) that follow
the stock, as well as the organisation
of entire roadshow days, allocating
them to the different brokers based
on their knowledge of a particular fi-
nancial centre and the investors cover-
gae. In these circumstances, the Chief
Executive Officer and CFO, together
with the Investor Relations Manager,
present the main results of the peri-
od (quarterly, half-yearly, annual), the
business trends and strategic guide-
lines and make themselves available
to answer any questions throught
dedicated Q&A sessions. There is also
a dedicated mailing list for the finan-
cial community, with which the com-
pany periodically communicates the
relevant financial news. All econom-
ic-financial information relating to the
company, as well as the main perfor-
mance indicators of the stock and the
