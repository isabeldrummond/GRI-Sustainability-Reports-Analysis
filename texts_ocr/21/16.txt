» A virtuous growth process

Established in 1974 as a data pro-
cessing centre for the Chambers of
Commerce of the Veneto region,
Cerved has grown by constantly in-
novating its products and developing
new businesses. Thanks to the consol-
idation and integration of other indus-
try players, Cerved today is a solid and
dynamic organisation and has been a
market leader for over 40 years.

Cerved Group's business model is dis-
tinctive for its resilience, robust and
sustainable growth and strong cash
flow generation. These distinctive
features have attracted the attention
of several private equity funds, with
their subsequent entry into its share-
holder base. In particular, Bain Capital
and Clessidra in 2008 and CVC Capital

Partners in 2013, provided a major
contribution to the Group's structured
growth path.

On 24 June 2014, the Cerved Group
made its debut on the MTA (Mer-
cato Telematico Azionario), Borsa
Italiana’s primary market, completing
one of the most important IPOs of the
year. Today, Cerved is truly one of the
few Italian public companies with al-
most 100% share float.
