The table shows the instances of the
exercise of rights by data subjects
who requested a corrective action
in relation to the Credit Information
and Credit Management division. No
reports were received regarding per-
sonal data processing errors in rela-
tion to the products of the Marketing
Solutions division.

CREDIT INFORMATION - BUSINESS
INFORMATION REGARDING
NATURAL PERSONS

If the report comes from a data sub-
ject (according to the definition con-
tained in the GDPR), the Group is re-
quired to give feedback on the type
of processing of personal data in
the archives since the form of the re-
quest is a privacy request. The request
can be made regarding access to data,
right to be forgotten and rectification
of personal data in Cerved's archives.
If the request comes from a legal
person, there is no obligation to re-
ply, since the person is not included
among the data subjects falling within
the scope of the GDPR. Customer ser-
vice will, however, provide support in
these cases also.

A total of 344 cases of privacy re-
quests were received and managed
in 2019, which required rectification
of data in Cerved’s archives for busi-
ness information purposes. Data
are available only from 25 May 2018,
due to the need to adjust ticket clas-
sification to the GDPR provisions,
meaning that comparisons cannot be
made with the time series of previous
years. To correctly calculate the trend
between 2018 and 2019, the same

periods (from 25/05 to 31/12 of both
years) have been considered. For the
sake of completeness, the 2019 annu-
al volume has also been reported.

In 2019, 3 complaints pursuant to
art. 77 GDPR were lodged by the data
subjects with the Data Protection Au-
thority. Only one of the complaints
resulted in inviting Cerved to adhere
to the data subject's requests, while in
no Case was a ruling issued against
Cerved. Finally, 4 proceedings were
initiated before the judicial author-
ity based on alleged personal data
breaches and, again, no rulings were
issued against Cerved.

CREDIT MANAGEMENT - DEBT
COLLECTION

In 2019, the Group received and han-
dled a total of 5 instances of the ex-
ercise of rights by data subjects who
requested a corrective action on the
data contained in the Credit Manage-
ment division’s databases, and just
one complaint to the Data Protec-
tion Authority followed by an invita-
tion to provide feedback.

At the time of drafting of this docu-
ment, the proceedings are still pend-
ing.

Such low numbers show the Group’s
commitment to managing custom-
er debt collection ethically. In 2019,
the Group revised the figures report-
ed in previous years and took into
account only reports that required
corrective action. This was necessary
to provide more accurate information
and a basis of comparison consistent
for 2019 volumes.
