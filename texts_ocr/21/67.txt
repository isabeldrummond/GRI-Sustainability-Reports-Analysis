Attention to the quality of life, peo-
ple’s wellbeing, equal opportunities,
training and adequate incentive
systems are a key factor of company
management for a business such as
Cerved Group’s, which acknowledg-
es the central role of individuals. The
Human Rights Policy was drawn up
to formally establish the Group's com-
mitment to these issues and was ap-
proved by the Board of Directors on
13 March 2020. The Policy confirms
the declarations made in the Code of
Ethics on human and personal rights
and specifies its principles, solid com-
mitments and management methods.
