ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND
FINANCING OF TERRORISM

Cerved Group companies that deal
with debt collection activities are re-
quired, as “Collection Agencies” (as
well as other operators: banking/fi-
nancial operators, professionals, oth-
er non-financial operators), not only
to investigate on the relationships
and transactions in which they take
part (art. 3 Italian Legislative Decree
231/2007 former provision'?, art. 18
paragraph 1 letter c, Italian Legislative
Decree 231/07 current provision), but
also to take appropriate measures
to identify and assess the risks of
money laundering and financing of
terrorism (art. 15 Italian Legislative
Decree 231/2007 as amended and
supplemented).

According to Italian Legislative Decree
231 of 2007, as amended and supple-
mented (art. 2), financing of terrorism
refers to any activity whatsoever
aimed, by any means, at the supply,
collection, provision, brokerage, de-
posit, custody or disbursement of
funds or other economic resourc-
es, howsoever generated, whether
directly or indirectly, even in part, for
the performance of one or more acts
for the purposes of terrorism as laid
down in criminal laws, regardless of
the use actually made of the funds
and economic resources for the com-
mission of the aforementioned acts.

The many requirements are aimed

to put in place the tools necessary
for identifying suspicions of money
laundering or financing of terrorism
and reporting them to the authori-
ties, and to make useful information
available to the authorities in a readily
usable format.

The Cerved Group has always con-
ducted its business with loyalty, fair-
ness, transparency, honesty, integrity
and in compliance with laws, regula-
tions and rules in general, with stand-
ards and guidelines, both national
and international, which apply to the
Group's activities. The Group pro-
motes the adoption of instruments
aimed at preventing, detecting and
communicating unlawful conduct
and/or conduct in violation of the ethi-
cal principles advocated by the Group.
For the purpose of investigating and
monitoring the risks related to money
laundering and financing of terrorism,
in addition to its many internal pro-
cedures and operating instructions,
the Group has adopted a specific An-
ti-Money Laundering and Financing
of Terrorism Policy approved by the
Board of Directors together with this
Sustainability Report.

Any violations concerning anti-money
laundering and financing of terror-
ism are collected in a specific Whis-
tleblowing Management System,
which guarantees the whistleblower's
confidentiality and anonymity. No
cases of violation of the anti-money
laundering regulations were reported
during 2019.
