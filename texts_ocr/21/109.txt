CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

 

The social role of Cerved:
data-driven sustainability

The Cerved Group’s corporate purpose and key mission is to
“help the national economic system protect itself from risk and
sustainably grow”. This mission is achieved by “putting data,
technologies and talent at the service of people, businesses,

banks and institutions”.

The definition of the new Purpose
stems from the true need to support
technological innovation by re-
launching Italian productivity with
data-driven innovation, a_ crucial
tool for reversing the normal trends
of economic stagnation, ensuring sus-
tainable growth with positive impacts
on the community.

The impacts identified translate into:

4 | educating and disseminating fi-
nancial culture;

| 2 | supporting the legislative and
economic decisions of the Italian
economic system;

improving the financial integrity
and transparency of the national
banking and economic system,

wg increased awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the
markets in which the companies
operate;

Bi interventions in favour of lend-
ing through the risk management
analysis tools available to the
Group.

The social role of Cerved Group and
its impact on the community is
therefore intrinsic in its reason for
being.

In 2019 the Group prepared the Com-
munity Support Policy approved by
the Board of Directors on 13 March
2020 and published on the corporate
website. In the document, Cerved
formalised its commitment to social
responsibility in support of the com-
munity and the territories in which it
operates.
