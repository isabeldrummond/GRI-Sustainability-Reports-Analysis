CERVED GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

For the sixth consecutive year, the
Board of Directors promoted an an-
nual self-assessment process, in line
with international best practices and
with the provisions of the Corporate
Governance Code. The process con-
sisted of the individual completion
by the directors of specific question-
naires. The self-assessment process
is repeated and discussed on a year-
ly basis by the Board of Directors.
It covers the adequacy of the size,
composition and operating proce-
dures of the Board of Directors and
of its internal committees, as well as
the professional characteristics, man-
agerial experience and seniority of the
individual professionals who serve on
the Board of Directors.
The self-assessment showed positive
findings as regards the operation,
size and composition of the Board of
Directors and its committees. Specifi-
cally, it emerged, among other things,
that:
> the number of directors on the Board
is considered the most appropriate;
> the size and diversity of background
and experience have enabled the
Board of Directors to operate ef-
fectively in a complex context char-
acterised by extraordinary transac-
tions and situations;
>the dynamics within the Board are
effective and the atmosphere during
meetings has remained open and
highly cooperative, ensuring a high
quality of debate, focused on prior-
ity and urgent matters;
> the work of the Committees has once
again been in line with best practic-
es and successfully integrated in the
Board's resolution process.

LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

Article 2.C.4., of the Corporate Govern-
ance Code recommends the appoint-
ment of a Lead Independent Director,
inter alia, if the Chairman of the Board
of Directors is the Chief Executive Of-
ficer. Having said this, although the
conditions for the appointment of the
Lead Independent Director were not
met, considering that the Chairman
of the Board of Directors was in any

case an executive director and with a
view to best governance, the Board of
Directors appointed Fabio Cerchiai
as Lead Independent Director on 19
April 2019.

The Lead Independent Director is
tasked with cooperating with the
Chairman of the Board of Directors
to ensure that the directors receive
complete and timely information
flows, and is authorised to convene,
independently or at the request of
other directors, special meetings only
for independent or non-executive Di-
rectors, to discuss issues deemed of
interest for the running of the Board
of Directors or for company manage-
ment.

INDUCTION PROGRAMME

Two sessions of the annual Induction
Programme were held on 27 May 2019
and 19 September 2019. The sessions
aimed at providing directors and
statutory auditors with in-depth in-
formation about the organisation,
performance and development of
the Group’s main operating areas - its
positioning with respect to its main
competitors, the product portfolio it
offers and its possible development
on issues linked to the relationship
between the Group and its investors.

These sessions were conducted with
the support of the Group’s top man-
agement and of consultants, repre-
senting both business and corporate
functions.

TOP MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION
PLANNING

In 2019, the Board of Directors
launched a Succession Planning pro-
cess through the Remuneration and
Nominations Committee. The pro-
cess focused on the first reports of
the Chief Executive Officer and was
designed to safeguard business man-
agement stability, reduce prospec-
tive risks associated with the lack of
managerial continuity in top manage-
ment positions, and avoid possible
impact, including reputational impact,
