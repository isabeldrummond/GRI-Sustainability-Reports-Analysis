Stakeholder engagement and
materiality matrix

It is with regard to its stakeholders, i.e., those who influence and/
or are influenced by the entity’s activities, that Cerved defines the
set of values and conduct guidelines that must be followed by all

those who operate for the Group.

The engagement process includes
identifying all material topics i.e. those
aspects that may generate signif-
icant economic, social and envi-
ronmental impacts on the Group’s
activities, influencing stakeholders’ ex-
pectations, decisions and actions.

The stakeholder map __ includes
Cerved’s main stakeholders, identified
according to specific business fea-
tures, the market and the intensity of
their relationship with the Group.

In 2017 Cerved started a process for
identifying all aspects that could sig-
nificantly influence stakeholders’
assessments and decisions. During
the reporting year, a questionnaire
aimed at understanding the percep-
tion of Cerved’s business was submit-
ted to certain categories of stakehold-
ers. The recipients assigned a score
ranging from 1 to 5 (where 1 means
that the topic is not relevant and 5
highly relevant) to the Group’s materi-
al topics. A brief description was given

of each topic.

The 2019 stakeholder engagement

process involved new stakeholder cat-

egories:

> Suppliers, agents and lawyers
dealing with the credit collection ac-
tivities provided by the Credit Man-
agement division;

> Prospect Clients who during the
Cerved Next event had confirmed
their availability to take part in the
engagement;

> University Partners;

> Updating of the Executive Manage-
ment Committee assessments.

The assessments of these new catego-

ries were added to the results of the

2018 activities involving:

> 1,057 employees

> 7 major investors

> > 10 Executive team members

> ~100 Real Estate expert

> 420 customers

> 10 Facility Management providers
