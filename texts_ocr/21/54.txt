Risk management

The Internal Control and Risk Man-
agement System of the Cerved Group
consists of a set of rules, procedures
and organisational structures intend-
ed to suitably identify, measure, man-
age and monitor the main risks, and
ensure that the business is run con-
sistently with the set objectives. The
Board of Directors, with the assistance
of the Control, Risk and Sustainability
Committee, exercises these functions.
In order to align risk governance with
best corporate governance practices
and taking into account the risk man-
agement and internal control powers
identified in the Corporate Govern-
ance Code, the Cerved Group has set
up its own process for identifying,
measuring, managing and monitor-
ing corporate risks called “Enterprise
Risk Management” (the “ERM Pro-
cess”).

In this regard, and with a view to fur-
ther structuring the process, a ded-
icated ERM function was set up, by
resolution of the Board of Directors of
Cerved Group S.p.A. of 23 December
2019 and subject to preparatory activ-
ities by the company and to discussion
with the Control, Risk and Sustainabil-
ity Committee.

The ERM process implemented at

Group level and with particular spe-

cialisations within the single subsidi-

aries includes the following activities

on a six-monthly basis:

> identifying and assessing the Group’s
main risks;

> identifying and updating the re-
sponse actions to manage the main
risks;

> identifying and monitoring the time-

frames for implementing any im-
provement actions.

In the course of 2019, the Cerved
Group further optimised the existing
Enterprise Risk Management model
and associated methodology through:

> definition of a framework to bring
together specific risk assessments
within the Risk Universe, such as those
related to Italian Legislative Decree
231/2001 and to information security;
> continuation of the transition to-
wards the COSO ERM Framework
- 2017: Enterprise Risk Management
Framework: Integrating with Strategy
and Performance.

Furthermore, the Cerved Group
strengthened the mapping of ESG
Risks, through specific classification. It
supplemented these risks with the re-
sults of the updated risk mapping and
assessment activities carried out. As a
result of this activity, Cerved Group’s
overall risk catalogue (so-called
“Risk Universe”) was updated.
Cerved continued on a path for the
continuous improvement of _ its
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
model by progressively implementing
methods and tools capable of manag-
ing all those events that, potentially,
could undermine the achievement of
the Group's objectives.

In consideration of the activities car-
ried out by Cerved and the charac-
teristics of the reference market, the
main risks identified by the Group
for the areas of relevance for the pur-
poses of Italian Legislative Decree
254/2016 and relevant management
methods are detailed below.
