The sources of Cerved competitive advantage

STRONG RESILIENCE OF THE CORE BUSINESS AND PRESENCE OF ACYCLICAL
COMPONENTS IN THE BUSINESS MODEL

In difficult macroeconomic conditions, the increased riskiness of counterparties
leads to very close examination and analysis of the credit positions and, therefore,
to greater use of information. Instead, when economic conditions are favourable,
volumes are driven by the greater number of commercial transactions and loan
requests, the use of decision-making systems, increasingly demanding regulatory
bodies, by the constant increase in non-performing loans and, finally, the growing
use of technologies by reference customers.

SOLID AND LONG-LASTING LEADERSHIP POSITION

Cerved has an over 40% market share in the Credit Information business, which
accounts for 59% of Group revenues. This leadership was achieved thanks to an offer
made up of the broadest and most accurate set of financial and commercial infor-
mation in Italy (with a history that would be difficult to repeat) and is guaranteed
over time by the high levels of loyalty and of integration of Cerved's services into
customers’ information systems.

HIGH REVENUE PREDICTABILITY

Cerved is able to guarantee high revenue predictability for the type of contracts
it uses, based on prepaid or flat fee subscription contracts with an average duration
of about three years and a high renewal rate in the Credit Information area, as well as
multi-year industrial partnerships for Credit Management contracts.

OPERATING LEVERAGE AND FIXED BASED COST STRUCTURE IN THE CORE BUSINESS
As a result of the cost structure, due to the significant operating leverage (high
fixed costs), the Group's profitability may vary significantly depending on the increas-
es in revenues.

M&A TRACK RECORD

Acquisitions are a lever used by Cerved to support organic growth, seizing opportuni-
ties in all three business areas and expanding its business in adjacent and synergistic
areas. Since the IPO, the Group has made 17 acquisitions: some have generat-
ed new business areas, such as the acquisition of the Credit Management division,
strengthened existing areas, particularly related to the Marketing Solutions division,
or even allowed the entry into new businesses, such as strategic consulting with the
acquisition of MBS Consulting. a
