» Directors and Executives

For executive directors and exec-
utives with strategic responsibil-
ities, the definition of the remuner-
ation policy is the result of a shared
and transparent process in which the
Company's Remuneration and Nom-
inations Committee and Board of
Directors perform a central role, as
provided by the Corporate Govern-
ance Code of Listed Companies. For

more details on the remuneration
policy of these professional figures,
please refer to the Remuneration
Report approved at the Shareholders’
Meeting of 16 April 2019 and available
on the company website.

In summary, the Remuneration policy

of this category of subjects envisages:

> Fixed component: determined tak-
ing into account the values of inter-
nal equity together with the profes-
sional characteristics, functions and
delegated responsibilities, the level
of availability on the market and cor-
porate risk if the employment rela-
tionship were to be terminated;

> Pay for performance - short-term
objective (STI): only paid with the
achievement of a consolidated
Group EBITDA result (ex-ante Gate)
which allows the zeroing of the var-
iable remuneration payable in case
of the non-achievement of the val-
ue set as the minimum threshold.
There is always a target bonus for
the achievement of 100% of the ob-
jectives and a maximum bonus for
over-performance, equal to 150% of
the target bonus. 50% of the final bo-
nus is linked to the achievement of a
corporate objective (EBITDA), while
the remaining 50% is determined by
the achievement of individual objec-
tives, also of a qualitative nature, re-
lated to sustainability, governance,
profitability and leadership.
