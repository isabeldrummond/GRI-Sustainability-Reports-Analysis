OPEN INNOVATION

Open Innovation is a paradigm that
enables Cerved to create greater val-
ue and be more competitive in the
marketplace by integrating digi-
tal talent into its staff, sponsoring
competitions for start-ups, providing
contributions to managed start-up
accelerators and activating initia-
tives aimed at identifying innovative
start-ups to be assessed as potential
acquisition targets. The event Cerved
Next is a good example of open inno-
vation. It is the largest annual event
organised by Cerved and is dedicated
to data-driven economy and to digital
transformation.

It is a unique opportunity to discuss
the themes of big data, fintech, dig-
ital lending and artificial intelligence
through demos and workshops held
by experts from different sectors, with
national and international experienc-
es.

PARTNERSHIPS

Cerved continued to pursue strate-
gic partnerships in 2019 to integrate
specialised competences and know-
how, drawing from the development
capital of university research entities
and start-ups. Through its ongoing
relationships with specialised busi-
nesses and an important community
of data scientists, programmers and
consultants, the Group has improved
its market position, successfully mas-
tering strategies that are part of the
disruptive innovation era.

For example, the Cerved Data Driv-
en Competition was implemented
thanks to a partnership with the Fin-
tech District, an open community that
aims to be the reference point for Ital-
ian Fintech, promoting collaboration,
networking and open innovation and
facilitating the aggregation of Fintech
operators, suppliers of technology
and investors.

On 16 April 2019 the Grand Finale of
Al WorkLab 2.0 was held, the final
event of the second edition of the
pre-acceleration program dedicated
to talent scouting and the develop-
ment of start-ups in the field of Arti-
ficial Intelligence, created by LVenture
Group and LUISS EnLabs in partner-
ship with American Express, Cerved,
growlTup, Invitalia, Sanofi and Sara
Assicurazioni.
