This document is the third consoli-
dated Non Financial Statement (also
“Statement” or “Sustainability Report”)
of the companies belonging to the
Group formed by Cerved Group S.p.A.
and its Subsidiaries (also “Cerved”, the
“Cerved Group” or the “Group”) drawn
up pursuant to Italian Legislative De-
cree no. 254/2016 and subsequent
amendments and additions.

The Sustainability Report 2019 con-
tains information (formalised and im-
plemented policies, risks and related
management methods, management
models and performance indicators)
relating to environmental, social and
personnel-related issues, respect for
human rights and the fight against
corruption, to an extent that ensures
a clear understanding of the activities
carried out, the progress, results and
impact produced by the Group.

This document has been drawn up
with the aim of providing a clear and
transparent representation of the
Group's activities, its organisational
model, the main risks and perfor-
mance indicators on environmental,
social and personnel-related issues,
respect for human rights and the
fight against bribery and corruption
that were deemed relevant, taking
into account the Group’s activities
and characteristics during the ref-
erence year (1 January 2019 - 31 De-
cember 2019).

This Statement was prepared in ac-
cordance with the GRI Standards
“Core” option, published in 2016 by
the Global Reporting Initiative, an au-
thoritative independent body dedi-
cated to the definition of models for
non-financial reporting. The disclo-
sure and indicators within the text
are reported in the GRI Content Index,

which provides a summary of the in-
dicators and related reference pages.
The “Appendix” represents an integral
part of this Report, showing detailed
information and tables with quantita-
tive data for the purpose of providing
exhaustive evidence of how the topics
identified as material were addressed
and of the respective GRI indicators.
The choice of performance indicators
took into account the materiality anal-
ysis, updated in 2019 and whose per-
formance methods are described in
the paragraph “Stakeholder engage-
ment and materiality matrix’.

The information and data included in
this document refer to the year 2019
and the performance trends, where
available, for the three-year period
2017- 2019, in particular, for the in-
dicators introduced for the first time
since these financial statements, it
was not possible to reconstruct the
data relating to previous years, also in
consideration of the evolution of the
Group structure. The qualitative and
quantitative information derives from
the corporate information systems of
the Group and from a non-financial re-
porting system specifically implement-
ed to meet the requirements of the
GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards
and are representative of the various
areas of the Decree, as well as consist-
ent with the activity carried out and
the impacts produced by the Cerved
Group. For each material topic, when
present, a corporate management
and organisation model was reported
along with the relative policies (includ-
ing those of due diligence), the results
achieved through them and some
non-financial performance indicators.
