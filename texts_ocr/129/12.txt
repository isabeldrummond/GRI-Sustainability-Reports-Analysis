Governance

UniCredit’s system of corporate governance promotes Clarity, accountability and the creation

of sustainable long-term value.

Governance model

UniCredit is an Italian listed company, with a
traditional management and control system,
which assigns specific responsibilities to the
Shareholders’ Meeting and allows for a clear
exchange of views between shareholders and
Management on fundamental decisions relating
to governance. These include appointing and
removing Directors, appointing members to the
Board of Statutory Auditors, granting a mandate
for external auditing to an audit firm and
approving all associated fees. Such decisions also
include the approval of financial statements, the
allocation of profits, resolutions on remuneration
and incentive policies and practices in accordance
with current provisions, as well as setting criteria
to determine compensation to be granted in the
event of early termination of employment or early
retirement from office.

Governance structure evolution

In a continuous effort to streamline the governance
structure, and in alignment with the lean but steering
organisation targeted in the Transform 2019 strategic
plan, in 2019 UniCredit put in place a reorganisation
of its management which will have full ownership

of the new Team 23 strategic plan presented to the
markets on December 3, 2019.

In the framework of a wider organisational review,
anew Group function called Finance & Controls
has been created. It is an extended function which,
in addition to Planning, Finance & Administration
and Investor Relations activities, also incorporates
those of Group Identity and Communication, Group
Regulatory Affairs, Strategy and M&A, Group
Lending Office and Group Institutional Affairs and
Sustainability. It also functionally coordinates the
activities of Group Legal, Group Risk Management,
and Group Compliance, that will continue to report
hierarchically to the CEO, facilitating the achievement
of synergies within the overall area of competence.

FOCUS MATERIAL
Sustainability governance and strategy mons
In support of the Board, the Corporate Governance,

Nomination and Sustainability Committee (CGN&S)

is responsible, inter alia, for supervising sustainability

issues within our Organisation. In 2019 the Committee ©
was also assigned with the supervision of ethics issues.

In this new task the Committee is supported by the

Chief Ethics Officer, a new senior position created in

2019, responsible for coordinating all ethics matters,

reporting to the Board and the CEO, and acting as an

advisor to the Group.

The Committee CGN&S has played a key role in ensuring
that sustainability issues were integrated in the new
strategic plan Team 23 as an important component
of the Bank’s business model (¢.g. inclusion of climate
risk in the Risk Appetite Framework of the Bank as
requested by the Internal Controls & Risks Committee).
The Committee also supervises the evolution of
sustainability in accordance with international
guidelines and principles on the subject and monitors
the Group's performance, as well as keeping abreast
of stakeholder concerns. The Committee is supported
by the Group Sustainability & Foundation function in
performing its activities.

Sustainability embedded in the new
remuneration policy

In the Team 23 strategic plan, sustainability forms
an ever more central part of everything we do and
is fully integrated into our business and decision-
making process. As a further confirmation of our
commitment to ESG Topics, Sustainability KPls will be
formally embedded in the new 2020-23 Long-Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP) for the CEO, Top Management
and other Key Players in the Group, thereby
representing an integral part of UniCredit’s strategy
to generate long-term results with a renewed focus
on improving customer experience and a constant
dedication to its people.
