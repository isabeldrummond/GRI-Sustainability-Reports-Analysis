new flexible formats, integrated with digital
channels and fully focused on advisory.

Our mass market services model will continue to
evolve thanks to a mix of integrated channels:
«an improved unique mobile banking app with a
single look and feel across the Group
* more direct customer sales and services,*?
integrated customer management via remote
centres and digital channels. We will also support
targeted growth in selected segments by using
data analytics. We have successfully launched a
project to identify affluent clients in the midst of
our mass-market segments in order to offer them
better targeted products and services
the evolution of our service model with a
renewed focus on the conversion of deposits
into Asset under Management (AUM) would be
possible not only for the mass market, but with a
view also to increasing our wealth management
and private banking business, strengthening
coverage and enhancing our value proposition
thanks to additional investments in products and
services, by leveraging the group-wide platform
and using data analytics.

Regarding our product catalogue, we will continue
to leverage the innovative payment solutions

Growth engines

UniCredit’s CEE franchise is the largest and most
diversified in the region. We aim at reinforcing
and further exploiting this leadership position and
economic potential to deliver sustainable returns
and further improvement in cost efficiency.

The CEE division continues to be an important
growth engine for the Group: several initiatives
have been launched to ensure sustainable business
growth and to add value to our unique franchise in
the region.

} On the Corporate side, the current working

capital (WoCa) product offer will be upgraded in
order to achieve a fully-fledged WoCa product
line across CEE.

In addition, the overall commercial focus on SMEs
and multinationals will be strengthened while the
focus on maximising synergies within the Group
through Cross-border activity will remain, thanks
to an increasing number of international customers
and our fully plugged in CIB.

: On the Retail side, CEE will continue its

digitalisation journey, increasing the potential
of digital channels and rationalising back office
processes."

Actions to simplify the product offer will also be
undertaken, contributing to the creation of solid
bases for the simplification and digitalisation of
processes. A specific focus on Consumer Finance
will allow us to strengthen our market position
in Consumer Lending throughout the region,
particularly in Hungary, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia where we will initially concentrate our
effort, leveraging, for example, an enhanced
pre-approved loan offer (available on online
channels with reduced time to acceptance) and a
simplified service model.
