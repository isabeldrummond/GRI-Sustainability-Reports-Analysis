Advance digitally with
customer-centric focus

Robust and secure ICT structures have always been
fundamental to the efficacy of our processes and

the advancement of our service model. Investing in
these measures is core to our new Team 23 strategic
plan? which is strongly focused on migration towards
direct, digital channels, for example aiming for 60
percent digital users across our individuals customer
base by 2023. During the course of the strategic plan
we will be committing on average €900 million per
annum to IT improvements.

Stepping up our ICT

We successfully finalised our Transform 2019
strategic plan objectives to rationalise and
consolidate our IT architecture and infrastructure,
harmonising across geographies and business areas.

 

i \ Actions undertaken in the period of the
: he plan include the decommissioning of:

over 1,700 servers

more than 1,500 applications

  

 

We also accelerated our cloud adoption journey which
included setting up a private cloud farm on premises
running over 4,000 virtual desktops for developers,
supporting quicker turnaround of ICT solutions.

Feedback collected through our Internal Service
Quality (ISQ) survey regarding IT services has been
instrumental to identifying areas of improvement
within our processes. In 2019 the percentage of
satisfied respondents to the survey improved by 8
percent versus 2018, following the positive trend
recorded the previous year. Moreover, we achieved
an approximate 40 percent reduction in ICT major
incident occurrences in 2019 versus 2018, thanks to
streamlining processes and increasing resilience.

Applying innovative ways of working to our ICT set
up is also beneficial. In 2019 we initiated productive
application of our Development and Operations
(DevOps) project capabilities, which leverages

Our Strategy
~ Intellectual Capital

streamlined collaboration between software
development and operations, and automation, to
facilitate the delivery of high quality, timely and
effective ICT solutions.

A central pillar of UniCredit’s digital transformation

is our mobile banking channel which we target as

a best-in-class customer experience. In 2019 we
successfully converged our Italian and German mobile
banking applications into a single global app which
was rolled out to local retail customers, with Austria
to follow in the first half of 2020. This has not only
achieved a more user-friendly, seamless banking
experience and universal app enhancements across
these countries including pre and post sales products
and services such as instalment payments, but has
also secured important ICT synergies in the spirit of
One Bank, One UniCredit.

Our mobile leadership drive in Central and Eastern
Europe (CEE) also progressed with our Mobile

First project. We applied an innovative front-end
development framework comprising state-of-the-
art technologies and extended the ICT architecture
to accommodate increasing user volumes and

best manage operational risk whilst preserving
quality and reducing time-to-market of releases.
Technology from Meniga’, a best-in-class digital
banking fintech, was also integrated, enabling
more data-driven, client-tailored content. With 154
functionalities available in 9 CEE countries, such as
card management and spending analytics, the Mobile
First app provides a modern customer experience
whilst simplifying everyday banking.

In 2019 we also instated our Group Chief Information
Office and Group Chief Security Office, previously

a single function, and established the role of
General Manager of UniCredit Services, our global
services company. These organisational changes are
important enablers of success in meeting our ICT
and ICT security objectives, strengthening execution
and control. Furthermore, we are investing in skills
development, establishing dedicated training paths
for competencies which are essential to advancing
our efforts in these areas.’

Fortifying our ICT security
Cyber-crime is a growing concern for the financial sector

and beyond, requiring a high level of presidium to
protect client and company data and assets.*
