Risk Management
and Compliance

Managing environmental and social risks

Sound risk management requires a deep understanding of many types of risk, including environmental and social
risks and their subsequent impacts on financial results and the balance sheet.

Through its Global Policy - Group Credit Operations (chapters on Project Finance and Structured Trade and Export
Finance) and other special policies and practices, UniCredit assesses and manages both traditional economic
and financial and non-financial impacts. These include environmental, social and other reputational risk impacts
associated with performance of its customers in these areas.

With this in mind, UniCredit implements and integrates the Equator Principles (EP), whenever applicable, into its
project financing transactions. Furthermore UniCredit has adopted detailed special policies regarding sectors that
present significant environmental and social risks. As a consequence, our Group monitors portfolio exposures to the
above mentioned sectors. In keeping with our commitments, we work to disseminate a strong inner culture of risk
management that prioritises environmental and social issues.

Implementation of our environmental, social
and operational and reputational risk sector policies

Certain sectors and activities require a specialised approach to ensure that transactional and related risks are properly
addressed. We have developed detailed guidance policies for sectors relevant to UniCredit that are susceptible to
special environmental and social risks.

These policies are inspired by agreements, guidelines and standards (including the International Finance Corporation
Performance Standards, the World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines and the principles of

the UN Global Compact), as well as other practices widely employed by specific industries. Indeed, we consider these
documents to be representative of best practices for assessing and avoiding potential environmental and social
impacts. Through the implementation of appropriate management and mitigation measures on behalf of our clients
and counterparts, UniCredit aims to avoid or limit the risks associated with transactions and projects in these sectors.

The sectors affected by the above mentioned policies include: water infrastructure (dams, in particular), nuclear
energy and the coal sector. In 2019 we updated the Defence/Armaments and the coal sector policies. At the same
time we developed a new policy regarding the Arctic and Non-Conventional Oil & Gas Industry.

To support the spreading of these policies specific workshops and training sessions have already been planned for
2020 for colleagues (relationship managers, risk managers, members of other functions involved in due diligence
processes) to correctly assess all risks related to clients involved in these sectors.

The criteria for these policies are regularly reviewed so that all emerging environmental and social standards and any
additional relevant impacts are taken into account in financial decision-making processes. When necessary, external
experts are involved in these processes.

These policies apply directly to UniCredit SpA and are addressed to all Group legal entities that engage — whether
through lending or other forms of financial assistance with the above-listed sectors. Their adoption is subject to
monitoring by the parent company’s Group Risk Management functions.

Furthermore, UniCredit’s policies define specific internal processes to consistently identify, assess and monitor potential
environmental and social risks. Screening records and tools are implemented in our standard risk and compliance check
to support the performance of comprehensive due diligence. These utilise information derived from business intelligence
providers on environmental, social and governance risks inherent to the most sensitive and other relevant sectors.

Transactions are generally screened by the legal entity responsible at both the transactional and the client level. A
record of the screening process is integral to the compliance assessment and must be completed before approval
is granted. In 2019 1,114 transactions were assessed for potential environmental, social, and other reputational
issues. More than 900 of these transactions were related to our sector policies.
