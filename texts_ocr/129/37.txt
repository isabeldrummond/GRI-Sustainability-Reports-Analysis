Our Strategy
~ Social and relationship Capital

Invest in long-term
stakeholder
relationships

Engaging with stakeholders is essential to building
trust. We are investing in a series of initiatives that
enhance collaboration and ongoing dialogue with our
key stakeholder groups.

Engaging with our customers

UniCredit aims to provide its customers with a unique
experience based on a high-quality service approach
which begins by really listening to them. This focus
on customer experience is renewed in the Team 23
strategic plan.

In the new strategic plan, UniCredit has adopted the Net
Promoter Score (NPS)? as key performance indicator to
measure customer experience. The NPS is a worldwide
standard used across many industries to measure loyalty
by understanding customers’ willingness to recommend
their bank to friends, colleagues or business partners.
Clients are segmented into promoters, passives and
detractors which allows the bank to take bespoke actions
in line with the characteristics of each segment.

UniCredit has developed a system of measuring the

NPS in a holistic way which is being rolled out step by

step in the different markets, supporting the banks’

strategic initiatives:

¢ The Benchmarking Study, carried out by the
Holding, measures the strategic NPS in local
markets, allowing the Group to compare its local

Group stakeholder integrated listening

BENCHMARKING INTERVIEWS

UniCredit banks score to those of its competitors
and to understand the main drivers. Individual and
corporate customers of UniCredit and of competitor
banks involved in the survey are selected randomly
by the research provider which ensures a fair
comparison.

The strategic NPS was integrated in the new
Long-term-Incentive Programme (LTIP) for senior
managers in which UniCredit aims to achieve a
consistent positive gap on the NPS in comparison to
competition at Group Level

Relationship Surveys are carried out by local banks
to measure the quality of relationship overall,
allowing banks to service customers, improve
cross-selling and prevent churn by performing
caring actions on detractors

Instant Feedback Surveys, carried out by local banks
measuring the NPS at single customer journey or
touchpoint level. This allows the banks to close the
loop performing individual caring actions as well as
continuously improve its processes and the way it
serves its customers. To facilitate the roll-out, the Group
selected a global provider that will run instant feedback
surveys in the different countries of the Group.

UniCredit integrates the collection of solicited
feedback with the analysis of internal operational
data as well as with unsolicited observations.

As described at the launch of the project last year,
UniCredit uses a systematic Voice of the Web listening
tool which applies big data and artificial intelligence
methodologies to monitor publicly available data on
social media and the open web with the aim of:

* monitoring brand reputation and sentiment online
+ analysing conversation related to specific products
and services in order to track potential issues and

identify untapped consumer needs.

This supports the business in the development of
solutions linked to customer needs.

Group-wide, our complaint management systems
allow us to identify any sources of concern and to
promptly resolve them to the satisfaction of our
customers.

In Romania, we implemented automated triggers for
customer experience surveys, scaling up real-time
feedback for main touchpoints and journeys
throughout the entire customer lifecycle.

Customers are able to express their concerns at any
time during their journey through the bank.

Thanks to the close the loop process, we can identify
possible reasons for client dissatisfaction and deal
with them before the client actually makes a formal
complaint.

Moreover, we developed the Customer first contest in
various branches of the network: these are quarterly
contests based on branch experience surveys and
complaints management process flow. The results
combine NPS for branch experience with the score
obtained for a correct registration of complaints
received within the branch.

The initiative raised branch staff awareness in

terms both of the importance of putting customers
first during interaction and of a timely and correct
registration of complaints.

In Bulgaria we developed a new process for gathering
corporate customers feedback (instant feedback
surveys). Its main goal is to measure customers
satisfaction and to collect ideas, right after receiving
a service or signing a contract. Moreover, it is also a
channel which brings early warnings and can be used
to prevent potential complaints and customers churn
(mid and long term). Currently, we are redesigning the
survey and we are including gamification in order to
boost-up clients response rate.
Based on the collected feedback from instant feedback
survey, Group benchmark survey and our business
structures, we launched the following initiatives:
« Business Easy, preapproved loans for Small and
Medium Enterprise (SME) clients (up to € 250,000)
« Fast Track (FT) process enhancements; we are
developing changes in the criteria and the eligible
collateral type: the FT process allows credit
authorities delegation to the business division SME
clients.

In Italy, the Customer Advocacy programme was
launched to fully reshape the customer intelligence
framework on corporate clients, identifying and
addressing customer experience. The project takes

Our Strategy
~ Social and relationship Capital

advantage of a set of ad-hoc tools to provide an
approach aimed at strengthening the relationship
between the bank and its customers, thus improving
the experience while providing actionable insight to
the bank.

Each segment’s customer journey is mapped so that
the programme best suits the client’s real needs.

By engaging with our customers, this project enables
us to better understand their needs and to cope in
time with situations which could otherwise jeopardise
the customer-bank relationship.

This year around 3,000 clients were interviewed
using the top-down approach while around 6,000
clients were interviewed through instant feedback;
nearly 90 large corporate clients were interviewed
by external market intelligence leader Greenwich
and approximately 150 caring actions were
performed.

During 2019, our approach on social media has
changed slightly as the Group has formally chosen to
close its Facebook and Instagram profiles as of June
2019, to invest in the enhancement of proprietary
digital channels. Despite this, social media continue
to be important as a tool for delivering key messages,
important business and innovative initiatives as well
as for providing useful information on products and
services across the Group.

Customers who write comments and make specific
requests are attended to, via private message or
most preferably via our proprietary channels.
During 2019 around 5,400 requests were managed
on social networks in Italy.

Interacting with stakeholder groups

Open interaction with key stakeholders helps us build
a sound banking environment based on transparency
and mutual understanding.

Our broad base of stakeholders includes regulators,
investors, rating agencies and consumer associations,
with whom we work constructively through a variety
of channels. We communicate through our corporate
websites, annual reports and social media platforms,
we participate in meetings, forums and other events
and we carry out numerous consultations and surveys.

UniCredit is a Global Systemically Important Bank
(G-SIB) and, as a pan-European bank, is subject to
different regulations and supervisory authorities. For
this reason we engage with regulators at national,
European and international levels.
