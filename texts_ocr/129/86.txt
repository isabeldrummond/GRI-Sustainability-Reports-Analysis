Data includes the full set of legal entities considered in the respective 2019 Integrated Report perimeter (corresponding to a full-time equivalent of more
than 82,000) and 2018 Integrated Report perimeter (corresponding to a full-time equivalent of more than 85,000), unless otherwise stated. Country-to-
country comparisons may be misleading as different tracking systems should be taken into account. Refer to the Natural Capital chapter for more information
