The Group has zero tolerance towards acts of corruption, prohibits facilitation payments and does not permit any

transfer of value to public officials without approval.

The Group’s approach to anti-corruption and anti-bribery is set out in the Global Compliance Policy on
Anti-Corruption and associated Group Operational Rule.

The GLobal Policy sets minimum standards of anti-corruption compliance throughout the UniCredit Group and is
published on the Group website. Whenever local rules in a country of operation are stricter than Global Policy, the
stricter local rules apply. Each local entity is responsible for the development and implementation of an effective

local Anti-Corruption Programme.
