Team 23

Team 23 is our new four-year strategic plan covering
the years 2020 to 2023 launched on 3 December
2019 during our CMD. The plan owes its name to
the previous Transform 2019 three-year plan, the
successful execution of which would not have been

GROW AND TRANSFORM
STRENGTHEN AND MAXIMISE

CLIENT FRANCHISE PRODUCTIVITY

 

The underlying assumption is Sustainability, showing
how in UniCredit value creation means more than just
generating financial values. It also means integrating
sustainability into our business strategies in terms

of human capital, society and environment. This
commitment was shown in November 2019 with the
announcement of a series of sustainability targets fully
integrated into business strategies.

From a financial perspective, as was Transform
2019, Team 23 is a pragmatic plan with tangible
actions based on conservative assumptions. The
below represented targets were set considering a
framework characterized by still negative interest
rates impacting on the Bank’s profitability, limited
macroeconomic growth and regulatory headwinds.

In order to achieve our new targets, Team 23

will be supported by investments in process
optimisation and IT. As far as IT is concerned,
investments will be increased by 17% to €900m
on a yearly basis. We partially anticipated
investment needs® for Team 23, spending more
than initially budgeted in the last three years with
a growing focus on cyber security and productivity.
Over the Team 23 life span, we will spend a total of
€9.4bn in IT or more than €2.3bn a year, €900m of
which is for changing the bank projects.

B. In Team 23 time horizon

 

Grow and strengthen
client franchise

While Transform 2019 was primarily about restructuring
and reshaping the bank by putting emphasis on capital
strengthening and asset quality improvements, Team 23
is about building up and further strengthening our client
franchise thanks to more efficient and streamlined
products and services and to an improved customer
experience. We will continue to focus on asset quality
and to ensure that we maintain very strong capital, now
from a position of strength, thanks to the achievements
of Transform 2019.

In order to better understand the transition to the
new approach embedded in Team 23, the first pillar
can be explained by some selected examples:

« Customer experience

+ Go-to bank for SMEs

« Enhanced service model for individuals

¢ Growth engines

Customer Experience

We renewed our focus on customer satisfaction and

service quality moving from a strong cost efficiency

de-risking effort during Transform 2019, towards a

focus on strengthening and growing customer base

with Team 23 through:

- Customer experience considered as key driver for all
strategic initiatives

- Client satisfaction measured at channel and
touchpoint levels within customer journeys to drive
process optimisation

- Commitment to improve competitive position for
Strategic Net Promoter Score (NPS)° at group level

Strengthen our position as Go-to bank
for SMEs

We are the go-to bank for European SMEs, a

fast-growing segment in both Western Europe and

CEE, and we will continue to enhance our strengths

by leveraging key success factors such as:

- longstanding advantage, thanks to well-established
local commercial banks
