IMPACT FINANCING

 

+ APPROACH

We provide financial and other types of support to entrepreneurial initiatives that respond to the main social needs arising from our communities.

We reward projects that demonstrate a clear social impact through financial benefits (grants, lower interest payments, etc.) and extra
services (mentorship, training, etc.) using a pay-for-success approach. We aim to promote cohesion between private companies and
non-profit organisations.

An innovative start-up since 2015 has been creating, implementing and selling a digital programme based on
the potential development of parenting and caring skills as the foundations for building leadership practices.
It is dedicated to those who work and have, or are about to have, young children. Between 2016 and 2018 the
number of volunteer members (those who received training) increased from 783 to 3,450 in Italy for a total of
35 companies that today offer this type of training to their employees.

Bulgaria

We disbursed €1 million to a foundation the mission of which is to provide the resources to support, motivate
and strengthen young LGBT+ people. The specific initiative financed by SIB aims to combat stigma faced by young
people, bullying and homophobia through the creation of a community centre that will include a bar/bistro, a
multi-functional space for events, a co-working area, a theatre, a cinema, a club and a library. The community will
also include separate offices offering educational and psychological assistance by an expert team.

Launched in the school year 2017-2018, the Start Up Your Life programme offers financial education,
entrepreneurial education and orientation tools towards future studies and/or job. Contents are delivered by a
dedicated online platform and are enriched by class training provided by bank or volunteer trainers as well as
by speeches of entrepreneurs and top managers. Every year the schools that worked on project activities are
invited to participate in a national contest; in 2019 we awarded 12 schools at an award ceremony organised
at UniCredit Milan headquarters where the Italy Co-CEOs and other senior managers hosted 120 students and
teachers.

 

STORIES THAT MATTER

Germany

Significant financial education initiatives are carried out in partnership with Joblinge (a collaboration of the private,
public and volunteer sectors to better prepare disadvantaged young people for the job market). During a 6-month
programme young people can prove themselves and their skills in a real-life context, far from school grades and
conventional job interviews. SIB offers workshops on financial education; in 2019, after successful training sessions
with positive feedback, these workshops have now become an integral part of the regular Joblinge programme in
13 German cities.
