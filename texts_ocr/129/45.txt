Natural Capital

The Earth’s natural resources and the countless services they provide make human life
possible. The bank’s activities have an impact on natural capital and must therefore be
monitored and limited.

Execute an effective
environmental strategy

UniCredit is committed to protecting natural
capital. Sustainability has been fully integrated
into our new strategic plan Team 23. As natural
capital underpins a more equitable and just
society, green finance has correctly been defined
by the EU as finance to support economic growth
while reducing pressures on the environment and
taking social and governance aspects into account.
Accordingly, instruments originally meant to serve
green goals, have recently been designed to cover
a broader Environmental, Social and Governance
(ESG) boundary which we present within the
natural capital context.

UniCredit aims to play a central role in facilitating
the transition to a more sustainable economy and
sees sustainable finance as a mean to achieve this
goal.

In this respect, UniCredit has set up a Sustainable
Finance Advisory Team within the Corporate

& Investment Banking Division. Combining
sustainability expertise with capital markets
capabilities, the new team aims to deepen client
engagement on ESG related topics and facilitate
their access to Europe’s sustainable financing
market. Furthermore, the team is advising
clients on brown-to-green transition strategies
whilst supporting the origination of ESG finance
mandates with corporates, financials and
Sovereigns, Supranationals and Agencies (SSAs)
across the value chain.

The Sustainable Finance Advisory Team is also
responsible for ensuring that relevant transactions
in the Group comply with the Equator Principles,
the financial industry benchmark for determining,
assessing and managing environmental and social
risk in projects.

Our Strategy
~ Natural Capital

Promote business that
supports natural capital

At UniCredit, we are always open to business
opportunities that arise from the need to address
environmental challenges.

Shifting to a low-carbon economy

As climate change is the key challenge of our time,

we seek to address the issues it poses through a
two-pronged approach: firstly by setting up quantitative
targets aligning our portfolio to UN climate goals

and secondly, with our commitment to reducing our
operational emissions of greenhouse gases.

With the aim to supporting our clients in their shift to
a low-carbon economy, in 2019 we endorsed the Task
Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
recommendations.”

Furthermore we are among the group of banks who
agreed on road testing the Paris Agreement Capital
Transition Assessment (PACTA) methodology developed
by 2° Investing Initiative (2°ii).? The project will match
economic assets with unlisted financial assets in order
to verify the alignment of our lending portfolio to the
Paris Agreement reference trajectory, setting the basis
for a 2°C scenario analysis as recommended by the TCFD.
With regard to climate-related sectors, we issued a new
policy on Arctic and Non-Conventional Oil & Gas Industry
Sector and we improved our policy in the coal sector.’

Supporting renewable energy sources

We are continuing to invest in renewable energy
sources. As at December 2019, our portfolio of
renewable energy projects was valued at €6.9 billion.*
Overall, the largest portion of our financing for
renewable projects goes to photovoltaic plants, with a
share of 51 percent. Wind energy comprises

38 percent of the portfolio with other renewable
energy sources making up the remaining 11 percent.

5, Expressed in terms of Exposure at Default. The significant decrease compared to 2018 is mainly due to the absence of the contribution of Vapi ve Kredi Bankasi AS

following the reduction of UniCredit stake in the company.
