~ Risk Management and Compliance

Decisions regarding transactions that have been assessed as high-risk, as defined by applicable policies and the
competent committees of the local legal entities, are submitted to the parent company for approval. Assessments
must be updated regularly as part of the annual credit lines renewal process.

Transactions that carry intrinsically higher risks require an independent expert or third-party review (e.g.
Environmental and Social Impact Assesment or equivalent) in order to ensure a rigorous approach to identifying,
quantifying and, where appropriate, mitigating and monitoring risks.

Internal reporting on exposure and risk indicators is managed by risk functions at both the local legal entities and
the parent company. On a quarterly basis, the Group Operational and Reputational Risk function submits a report
on the non-binding opinions (NBO) that have been issued over the period to the Group Operational and Reputational
Risk Committee (GORRIC). This report provides an overview of the number of transactions declined, approved or
approved with conditions during the risk assessment process.

During the year we reinforced our governance on reputational risk. The Group Reputational Risk Council
implemented in 2018 became a Committee in its own right. The Group Reputational Risk Committee (GRRC) is
responsible for the assessment of the reputational risks of initiatives, transaction banking, projects, customers

and other business activities. The GRRC supports the Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) on governance guidelines for
the management of the reputational risk on sensitive sectors and customer relationships, the related mitigation
actions and all the other relevant topics submitted by the Reputational Risk function. The GRRC involves the
proposing Business function together with Group Risk Management, Group Lending Office, Group Compliance, Group
Legal, Group Sustainability & Foundation and evaluates the participation of the CEO and other relevant functions on
a case-by-case basis. During the year there were 19 meetings and the transactions analysed amounted to 44.

Implementation of the Equator Principles

UniCredit has adopted the EP? as a financial industry benchmark for determining, assessing and managing
environmental and social risk in projects. The EP are primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due
diligence to support responsible risk-related decisions and are based on the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability and the World Bank Group Environmental,
Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines.

In 2003, UniCredit was among the world’s first adopters of the ten principles that constitute the EP. Since then,
our Group has actively contributed to the framework’s development. Also in 2019, we continue to be engaged

in the work of the association and to participate in specific working group initiatives that align with our strategy,
geographical scope and business footprint. These activities have provided UniCredit with valuable experience,
facilitating the implementation of the framework Groupwide and enhancing engagement with stakeholders.
The EP apply globally to Project Finance Advisory Services, Project Finance, Project-Related Corporate Loans and
Bridge Loans across all industry sectors. We work in partnership with our clients to identify, assess and manage
environmental and social risks and impacts in a structured way on an ongoing basis.

Internally, an EP Advisory team oversees and supports implementation across the Group. The framework is
embedded in our various internal policies, providing a minimum standard for due diligence and impact mitigation
and supporting sustainable decision-making. Aside from roles, responsibilities and principles, these policies

(of which an example is our Global Policy - Group Credit Operations chapters on Project Finance and Structured
Trade and Export Finance) define the EP process for evaluations of specific projects. Furthermore, an EP-based
Non-Binding Opinion (NBO) is incorporated into our approvals process, as is an internal Equator Principles Screening
Tool that focuses on category A and B projects.?

The EP Advisory team represents UniCredit in the EP Association.

Where applicable, independent environmental and social experts are consulted to assist our transaction team in
accordance with the EP. Loan document covenants are also reviewed by the specialised transaction team, internal
legal department and, where appropriate, technical, environmental and social specialists. We regularly conduct
special workshops and training sessions to enhance our capacity to implement the EP within our organisation.

In 2019 roughly 70 employees from the risk competence line and business divisions, including Corporate and
Investment Banking (CIB), attended EP workshops and bilateral training sessions tailored to the needs of different
audiences. Participants received comprehensive instructions that introduced them to the EP framework and the
underlying World Bank Standards, leveraged peer-to-peer knowledge-sharing, and provided practical examples for
evaluating financial, environmental and social risks, among other topics.

In 2019 UniCredit also approved internally to adopt the EP4 for effective date of 01 July 2020. The development of
the EP4 was an intensive process which included also feedback obtained from a wide variety of stakeholders and
experts. The UniCredit EP Advisory team participated in the Social Impact and Human Rights working group (which
contributed as part of the EP Association to the development of the EP4). We will actively continue to support this
working group in the future. Moreover, in the first few months of 2020, several working groups will be developing
associated guidance to support relevant stakeholders in the implementation of the principles.
