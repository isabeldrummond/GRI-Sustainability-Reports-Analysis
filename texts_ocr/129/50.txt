Our Strategy

~» Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

The following extraction activities are all part of

the NCOG sector:

+ tar sands O&G

¢ ultra-deep water O&G (more than 1,500 metres
or 5,000 feet)

+ fracked/shale O&G

In addition, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is also
considered a non-conventional treatment if derived
from the non-conventional extractions reported
above, including “critical Arctic” activities.

The Global Policy also imposes strict
commitments in order to discipline corporate
financing activities.

The Policy is applicable in all countries and

provides guidelines with reference to:

¢ financing, lending or other forms of financial
assistance to critical Arctic and NCOG projects
with a disclosed use of proceeds in supporting
projects related to extraction, pipeline
construction and infrastructure set-up in both
sectors

¢ general financing, advisory services, or other
forms of financial assistance (corporate loans)
to companies involved in the critical Arctic and
NCOG business.

The Global Policy does not support:

¢ projects related to extraction of Oil & Gas in
critical Arctic and NCOG sector

* projects related to pipelines and other
infrastructures solely related to critical Arctic and
NCOG sector

* projects related to production of Liquefied
Natural Gas when solely related to critical Arctic
and NCOG sector.

The new Global Policy also provides the following

restrictive guidelines:

+ General financing, advisory services or other
forms of financial assistance to companies
involved in the NCOG sub-sector:

- criteria for onboarding new clients: the
Group can engage with new clients only if

the above-mentioned forbidden activities

related to NCOG provide up to a maximum of

25 percent of the total revenues recorded in

the year by the company, and that the above

defined critical Arctic activities provide up toa
maximum of 25 percent of total revenues

- as far as existing clients are concerned,

the relationship can continue if the

above-mentioned forbidden activities related

to NCOG provide up to a maximum of 25

percent of the total revenues recorded in

the year by the company, and that the above

defined critical Arctic activities provide up to

a maximum of 25 percent of total revenues. If

the quota of revenues related to the forbidden

critical Arctic or NCOG activities is above

the defined 25 percent threshold, the Group

requires a sound plan and an annual update in

which clients commit to reducing their share to
below 25 percent in future years.

 

In addition to introducing the above-mentioned
policies governing fossil fuel expansion, UniCredit
has gone one step further by committing to
increase its exposure to the renewable energy
sector by 25 percent by 2023 and to increase

: energy efficiency loans to customers.

Risk Management

With regard to climate change, both scientific
evidence and an increasing stakeholder awareness

of climate issues make UniCredit’s action a priority.

As a bank we are exposed both to physical and
transition risks. These risks can take the form

of significant credit, market, operational, and
reputational risks. At present the potential impact
on liquidity is not clearly understood. We are in
the initial phase of our process to develop and test
quantitative models to correctly measure climate
tisk and consequently embed it within our wider
financial risk assessment.

: Together, these models call for the development

of a bank-wide climate risk management
framework. As a bank we tend to align our
strategic horizon with the tenure of our lending
activities.

In this respect, short-term is the time horizon
considered for the repayment of a short-term loan
(18 months), medium-term is considered, as is
usual in the treasury market, up to 5 years and
anything beyond is regarded as long-term. Based
on this segmentation, climate-related risk can be
regarded as medium to long-term risk.

It is important to highlight that some quantitative
indicators set as sustainability goals, embedded
in our new Team 23 strategic plan and
comprehensive of climate risk monitoring, have
been integrated into the Risk Appetite Framework
(RAF) 2020 to monitor the achievement of the

: declared targets.

A very first step towards the achievement of

this important aspiration was the setting up

of a dedicated team within our Group Risk
Management, responsible for the supervision

and management of processes related to climate
change risks and UniCredit’s approach to sensitive
sectors.

MATERIAL
TOPICS

The first activity put in place by the team focused ©
on assessing the transition risk of listed companies

in our CIB portfolio in order to effectively manage

their environmental risk profile. Furthermore, a

relevant methodology will be deployed for other
corporate clusters.

With reference to physical risk, a preliminary
analysis estimating the most important impacts
connected to climate change risk has been
initiated. In terms of risk assessment, it results
mainly in impairment in value of collateral located
in high climate risk zones and it could be related
to chronic risk (i.e. rise in sea level) or acute risk
(more frequent and severe extreme events such as
river flooding, wildfire, storms).

The scope of the pilot study currently regards
the estimation of the potential impact of rise

in sea level on the value of individual mortgage
collaterals located at Italian seacoast sites; once
the methodology is consolidated, we will extend
the analysis to other chronic physical risks (river
flooding, wildfire, drought), also monitoring
extreme events (acute risks) over time and
integrating new info into our lending processes.

Moreover, during the year, thanks to the continuous

cooperation between the business functions

and the risk and lending functions, the firm

commitment to sustainability has also been

enriched, supported by clear targets for 2023 to

address climate change related risks including:

+ assisting customers towards the transition to a
low-carbon emission and climate resilient economy

+ improving our policies with regard to
climate-related sectors (i.e. Arctic and NCOG,
CFPG);

« strengthening our commitment to not supporting
companies involved in the deforestation of
rainforests.
