Transform and
maximise productivity

The second pillar confirms how UniCredit continues
to approach productivity transformation and
maximisation from two important angles. The first
is the way in which it improves customer experience
and the second is the way in which it contributes
towards maximising productivity controlling costs.

Two significant examples of how our bank is
committed to transforming and maximising
productivity are firstly, the paperless bank??
consisting in dematerialised processes to reduce
costs and operational risk. By leveraging the
best-in-class expertise within our unique and
extensive commercial banking network, we are
now able to spread this initiative across the Group.
Our focus is on key priorities: the enhancement of
customer experience in branches, the decrease of
operational risk and the reduction of cost to serve.
With this in mind, the main actions are:
¢ Convergence to a digital experience in the branch
¢ Implementation of straight-through processing
leading to faster transactions
« Exchange of digital documents between bank and
customers
¢ Wider set of digital-ready contracts, increasing use
of client digital signature

2023 GOALS - PAPERLESS
The Italian retail network will be paperless by

the second half of 2020, Austria and Germany
by 2021 for key products and CEE by 2023.

In the paper-based experience the documents
had to be printed, signed several times by the
customer and sent to central archives to be stored
and ex post dematerialised. All these activities
were time-consuming both for our customers

and employees. In the new digital experience all
documents will be provided to and shared with the
customer who can then sign them digitally. At the
end of the process contracts will be automatically
stored in the bank’s digital archive and shared with
the customer in a digital way.

The whole process will be completed without
generating any paper thanks to end-to-end
digital workflow and straight-through

+ processing capacities.

Furthermore, the customer will be able to access
the contracts anytime and sign them through an
independent channel. Such a digital journey enables
the completion of customer interaction within
minutes if not seconds compared to the lengthy
paper-based process.

FOCUS
End-to-end process optimisation project

During Transform 2019 we launched an end-to-end
process optimisation project. E2E means continuously
focusing on the full value chain, adopting a way of
working which brings business, support functions and
IT closely together.

Thanks to this approach we optimised the current
account opening process in Germany. What used to
take 80 minutes and more than 20 signatures on 60
pages of paper is now done in 15 minutes and needs
just one signature on a digital document.

These developments have greatly enhanced
customer experience and our branch managers now
have more time for focusing on customer needs. In
fact, Commercial Banking Germany managed to have
positive net new Individuals clients for the first time
in many years. The same process in Croatia takes four
minutes, so there is still room for improvement. This
improvement will be achieved thanks to active best
practice sharing across the Group and the continuous
reviewing of our processes.

Another excellent example for this pillar is
represented by the continuous process optimisation
that UniCredit is committed to and which leads to a
new way of working.

With the decidedly positive initial results deriving
from the E2E project launched during Transform
2019," the new Team 23 strategic plan makes this
approach a permanent part of our setup for six key
products: current accounts, cards, consumer finance,
mortgages, investment products and SME banking.
The overall main goals of this new way of working

is to streamline processes to enhance customer
experience and increase client business while
minimising operational risk.

2023 GOALS - E2E

Seamless cooperation between business, support
functions and IT to drive product innovation
across dedicated Customer journeys

In this framework IT is a key enabler in maximising
productivity. From now onwards, the main focus

in IT will be always more on the ability to attract,
develop and retain highly skilled IT profiles. Achieving
critical skills will also be important in securing the
adoption of new technologies in IT and in the bank of
tomorrow. At the same time, Group Operations will
deliver an increase in productivity (while ensuring
rework rate reduction) throughout the duration of
the plan. Such results will be achieved through the
shift towards a data-driven organisation which will
make real time advanced productivity tracking its
main driver; to do so the organisation will leverage
the newly developed Workforce manager Tool.

All considered, these factors will enable a higher
productivity. In order to ensure the respect of
adequate service levels set, Group Operations will
work towards leveraging the human and machine
mix in an effort to ensure an optimised capacity
distribution and reduce operational risks.

Disciplined risk
management & controls @

Credit, financial and operational risks, as well as, a

compliance are just a few of the aspects exemplified
in this pillar. Arguably, the management of credit and
financial risk is at the heart of what commercial banks do.

At UniCredit we favour long-term sustainable
outcomes over short-term solutions. Consequently, all
our remuneration and risk policies are based on this
concept. For instance, the duration of the Long Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP) has increased from seven to nine
years to consider the longer lengths of the plan as well
as to confirm the long-term commitments of the senior
management of the Group.
