Definition

Fostering and improving a culture
of inclusion, fairness and respect
by promoting equal opportunities
in the workplace so all colleagues
can maximise their potential

Recognising the importance

of environmental, social and
governance issues and embedding
them into specific business
strategies, maintaining high
standards for fair business
practices and expecting senior
management and employees

to treat all stakeholders with
fairness and respect

Basing our business practices
on strong ethics fundamentals:
respecting and supporting
human rights within our sphere
of influence; reinforcing a culture
of compliance and attention to
colleagues’ health and safety at
all levels of our organisation
Building and maintaining an
environment in which all data
and information confidentiality,
integrity and availability are
protected from relevant cyber
threats

Develop a climate change strategy
to manage transition risks and
physical risks arising from a
changing climate and seizing
related opportunities in order to
mitigate the impacts on global
temperature and to enhance
climate resilience

Bearing in mind the impacts

of demographic changes on all
our banking business activities
both in terms of demand and
supply of products and services
and wellbeing for customers and
colleagues

Understanding the priorities

of communities, supporting
sectors and enterprises which

can create social and economic
positive impacts (infrastructure,

financial education)
