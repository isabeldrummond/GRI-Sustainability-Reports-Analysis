Stakeholder Engagement

We really listen to our stakeholders. This has always been the underlying principle at
UniCredit — one which leads us to regularly invest in mutual feedback activities involving
all our stakeholders. We systematically collect and assess the opinions and concerns
expressed by our stakeholders and promptly respond to their observations.

Investing in long-term value creation means possessing the right insight into who and what
our business affects, but also how our business is affected by everything that surrounds us.

In order to manage risks and opportunities efficiently, a greater awareness of the topics that
interest our stakeholders can enable us to make more meaningful decisions and promote a
more sustainable strategy.

Materiality matrix

A As a result of engaging with our stakeholders, since 2010 UniCredit has periodically carried
out materiality analyses. This is a thorough approach that identifies critical economic,
environmental and social aspects which could have a significant impact on the company’s
business performance and therefore on long-term value creation.
The matrix below represents the upper-right quadrant of the overall matrix, resulting from the
analysis, it is then used to consolidate and assess concerns from all of the bank’s stakeholders:
it not only takes into account their needs and expectations (y-axis), but also monitors the bank’s

> investments and ability to address the issues stakeholders care about (x-axis).

For several years UniCredit has been carrying out

the materiality analysis aimed at identifying the
Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) elements
that have a significant impact on our business

results and in our ability to create value over the long
term. The resulting materiality matrix is the graphic
representation of a very important activity for our

company: listening to and engaging with stakeholders.
The matrix provides a clear view of internal and
external stakeholder needs and expectations.

Last year we concentrated our efforts on designing a
new process for the materiality analysis methodology
which is now greatly improved.*
