Managing performance

At UniCredit we have implemented processes to
set goals, assess performance and define career
development based on the following key principles:
achieving ambitious goals connecting the Group’s
strategy with individual contributions; empowering
managers to make decisions about their people;
rewarding merit and performance; ensuring respect
of our Ethics and Respect values and our Five
Fundamentals; encouraging individual development
and learning; increasing transparency with continuous
feedback.

UniCredit Performance Management is the
Group-wide appraisal and development process for
all our people. All employees receive a performance
review from their manager and the behaviours
expected are based on our guiding principle Do

the right thing!.? This process ensures a common
approach to performance management and decisions
on reward, career development and learning
opportunities.

In addition, our annual review enables us to define
career and succession plans that ensure a sustainable
leadership pipeline with regard to both executives
and employees on the executive track.

Developing skills

We invest in initiatives to foster the professional
development of colleagues and to ensure they can
support UniCredit’s objectives.

A development track is available to all UniCredit
employees. Both vertical growth and horizontal moves
may be possible based on emerging opportunities and
the fulfilment of individual goals. The track can be
locally customised to meet specific business needs.

For a selected pool of employees, identified according
to outstanding performance and potential, a fast-track
development path is available. In 2019 we redesigned
our executive development offer with the intention
of supporting our executives in each stage of their
career. Five phases have been identified: onboarding,
settlement, perfomance, consolidation and transition.
In particular, we have introduced dedicated paths to
meet the development needs in the onboarding and
settlement phase, in order to support those skills
required to face new challenges and tasks versus key
competencies.

These leadership development paths last from 18 to
36 months and in 2019 were initiated by more than
300 executives.

Over the course of the year we continued to foster
professional growth in our competence and business
lines using the modular and flexible programmes
available in our learning catalogue in fields such as
finance and risk management.

In addition, training opportunities specific to local
business needs in each country and division were
provided in order to enhance professional skills and
assist colleagues in their roles. Our efforts address
skills in retail, corporate and private banking as well
as upskilling in data science, advanced analytics and
engineering, skills we identified as those of the future
able to push the evolution of our organisation.

? We achieved a total of more than 30 hours
: training per capita in 2019 thanks to our
: investments in professional skills development.

Value diversity
and inclusion

UniCredit remains committed to ensuring an equal
opportunity workplace where people of all ages, genders
and cultural backgrounds can contribute to our success.
In line with our Ethics and Respect values, we strive to
listen to the needs of our diverse workforce by creating a
better and more accessible working environment based
on inclusion.

In 2019 our Group Diversity and Inclusion Manager has
worked alongside our CEO and other senior managers
with quarterly meetings while our Diversity and
Inclusion Committee monitors the initiatives and the
progression towards the targets assigned.

During the course of the year, our senior management
discussed the importance of this topic in specific
meetings and we continued to carry out awareness
building activities to foster an inclusive culture. We
designed Leading with inclusivity, a learning module

to support our executives in developing an inclusive
leadership style. In Italy, we launched an online training
on how to recognise and tackle our unconscious biases;
we will continue to deliver this course across the Group
in 2020.

Promoting gender balance

Our Global Policy on Gender Equality sets out
principles and guidelines to ensure a level playing field
throughout the organisation as a way of generating
higher value.

UniCredit has been consistently investing in supporting
the growth and development of female colleagues

in the organisation. Since signing the UK Women in
Finance Charter in July 2018, female representation
in our senior leadership roles has grown from 9 to

12 percent and the Group remains committed to
reaching 20 percent (+/-1 percent) by 2022.

The Group is committed to gender pay equality.
UniCredit has put a range of initiatives in place in
this respect: the equal pay principle is embedded in
the Group Compensation Policy; specific gender pay
equality targets have been assigned to all our senior
leaders; a monitoring process has been defined and
implemented.

In line with our Ethics and Respect values, from 14 to 18 October 2019 UniCredit launched its first Diversity and
Inclusion Week, during which around 13,600 employees explored the topic. Around 80 initiatives in 15 markets
took place including workshops, testimonials and training courses involving our colleagues and their families,

external experts and non-governmental organisations.

role and in which our Regional Manager participated.

 

Young refugees

In Germany colleagues reflected on how,
®@ as a bank, we can contribute to inclusion

in the employment market. Since 2011
we have cooperated with Joblinge, an organisation
which helps young refugees aged between 15 and
24 to find work. In addition to several workshops
held at our local offices, over 200 of our employees
were involved as mentors. This is the largest number
of mentors of all Joblinge’s partner companies.

employee inclusion experiences in
our bank. For example in Germany a network
of colleagues, wishing to advocate equal
opportunities in the workplace, regardless of sexual
identity, gender identity and gender expression,

was founded in 2014 and officially recognised in
2018. The network is called UniCorns.

bank’s Milan headquarters in cooperation with two
organisations supporting the blind, Unione Italiana
Ciechi and Istituto Ciechi Milano.
We launched a Guidelines on Disability brochure, a
vademecum on how to manage different disabilities both
at work and outside, created with the help of colleagues
with disabilities. A series of online training courses
addressing disability management were also published.
In Austria, colleagues gathered at the Sensing Journey,
an event in which they were given the opportunity
of gaining an insight into the everyday challenges of
people with different disabilities and learning about
their experience as bank customers.
Colleagues in Bosnia and Herzegovina attended a
workshop on unconscious bias towards people with
disabilities including a talk from an external speaker and
colleague testimonials.
