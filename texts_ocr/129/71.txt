~ Risk Management and Compliance

Global Policy and Group Operational Regulation are reviewed periodically. Moreover, Italian Group Legal Entities
have also implemented the Organisational and Management Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01
(Administrative liability of Legal entities, companies and associations). This Model establishes specific Protocols
preceding bribery and corruption issues.

For the purposes of the Policy, an act of corruption is defined as the giving, offering, promising, receiving, accepting,

demanding or soliciting directly or indirectly of monetary or non-monetary, tangible or intangible benefits in order

to obtain or retain an undue advantage in the course of business activities, irrespective of:

« whether the recipient of the act of corruption is a domestic or a foreign individual, a public official or a private
individual

« where the act is committed

¢ whether the result of such act entails an actual undue advantage or the improper performance of a function or activity.

All employees are responsible for complying with the Global Policy and Group Operational Regulation, any
corresponding local internal rules and procedures and all applicable anti-corruption laws in the performance of
their duties.

All employees shall report to the Local Anti-Corruption Officer or the Local Head of Compliance any instances of
actual or attempted acts of bribery and corruption they become aware of, whether the act of bribery and corruption
is offered, given or received.

Any report must be made according to the established internal process but in any case, in the first instance to
the Local Anti-Corruption Officer and, where actual or suspected money laundering is involved, also to the local
AML Officer. Failure to make such a report may Give rise to individual criminal liability on the part of the relevant
employee in certain jurisdictions, as well as exposing the Group to potential legal or regulatory action. Potential
acts of bribery and corruption may be reported also under the Global Policy on Whistleblowing.

The following mechanisms have been put in place to monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s approach to
preventing corruption and bribery: escalation procedures employed for significant and strategic issues; quarterly
report to the management of second level controls; compliance risk assessments performed for each regulatory
area in all legal entities within the Compliance function’s jurisdiction; internal audit reviews. The last two
mechanisms result in risk mitigation actions that must be completed on time to ensure the management of
identified risks.

Organisational and management model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001

UniCredit SpA has adopted an organisational and management model (hereinafter the Model, composed of two
Sections: General and Special) pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01 (administrative liability of legal
entities, companies and associations). The Model is integrated within the rules, procedures and control systems
already in place and applied in UniCredit SpA. The bank’s organisational framework consists of the set of rules,
structures and procedures that ensure the proper functioning of the Model; it is a structured, comprehensive
system with the aim of guaranteeing the prevention of unlawful conduct, including those provided for by the
specific legislation on the administrative liability of entities. In particular, the Bank has identified the following
supports to plan and implement the business decisions and carry out the relevant checks: the rules of Corporate
Governance; the Internal Controls System; the system of authorities and delegation; the Code of Conduct.

In addition, with specific reference to the risks deriving from Legislative Decree (LD) 231/2001, the Bank has
formalised the Special Section, that is, specific Decision Protocols that describe the at-risk activities, in relation to
which the relevant offences may be committed and the principles of conduct and control rules aimed at preventing
the offences. UniCredit SpA established additional rules of conduct in the Code of Ethics pursuant to Italian LD
231/2001, as an integrated part of The Model.

Antitrust

UniCredit has always been highly committed to compliance with Antitrust rules.

Following the Antitrust policies pursued and enacted in the past, in 2016 UniCredit deployed the Compliance-
Antitrust Programme at Group level (hereinafter CAP) aimed at:

+ increasing the governance of Antitrust matters at both company and Group level

¢ strengthening compliance culture and enhancing the Group’s reputation on the markets

« more effectively managing the risk of both Antitrust breaches and penalties.

In 2016 the CAP was deployed in UniCredit SpA and the main banks of the Group operating in the European

Union and since then has been shaped and calibrated on the basis of each bank’s specific features, business type
and size as well as target markets. The CAP is subject to monitoring and periodic review to ensure its continued
effectiveness.

Following the success of this initiative, in 2017 the CAP was extended to the main Group Companies (not limited to Group
banks) as well as to the foreign branches of UniCredit SpA and UniCredit Bank AG also beyond the European Union.

During 2018 CAP was further extended to some indirectly controlled companies in Romania as well as to the Abu
Dhabi branch of UniCredit SpA and additional classroom “tailor-made” training on Antitrust matters was delivered
to the Milan branch of UniCredit Bank AG.

In 2019 the CAP was refreshed and updated in 15 banks and was performed through:

¢ a dedicated mapping of any sensitive company Functions (i.e. those exposed to potential Antitrust risks, including
but not limited to Business ones)

+ targeted interviews of key people of the impacted Functions so as to identify specific Antitrust risks

« dedicated assessment of the Antitrust risks and subsequent roll-out of internal processes and controls (where
needed)

« tailor-made trainings, assigned to selected employees within the Functions affected by Antitrust risks.

In 2019 dedicated sessions on Antitrust were held at the EMC of UniCredit SpA and main committees of the Group banks.
