As a follow-up to the initial communication of
the E&R manifesto, other more decisive actions
were taken during the year. A policy covering
harassment, bullying and sexual misconduct
was approved at holding level and implemented
throughout the Group in June 2019.

Moreover, an anti-retaliation policy was introduced
with the aim of reinforcing a speak-up culture
within the Group and protecting all individuals who
report wrongdoing in any of the areas covered by
our policies.

: In order to increase the internal presidium and

: coordination among the different areas involved in the
: application and monitoring of E&R topics, in 2019 the
i position of Chief Ethics Officer (CEtO) was created.

This figure ensures that the Group develops the

Do the right thing culture with all stakeholders,

provides Group guidelines on ethical topics and,

in coordination with Human Capital and Group

Compliance, periodically updates the CGN&S

Committee on:

« training regarding ethics and conduct topics

¢ whistleblowing, including bullying, sexual
misconduct and harassment and retaliation

¢ updates on the internal regulations (e.g. Code of
Conduct).

Starting with these strong foundations and

given that 2019 was the final year of the former
Transform 2019 plan, a great effort was dedicated
to the preparation of the Team 23 industrial plan.
In this process, sustainability topics were a key
part of the discussion.

In fact, in accordance with the requirements of the
CGN&S Committee and the Board of Directors, our
senior management team focused on integrating
an increasing number of sustainability topics in the
business strategies of our Group.

Our Strategy

2 Strategic Plan

Different structures of the company were involved
in the various discussions on how sustainability
goals should be developed, including Group Risk
Management, Retail and Corporate Business

lines both in WE and CEE, CIB, Investor Relations,
Internal Communications, Media Relations and
naturally Group Sustainability and Foundation.

The entire process was closely followed by the
senior managers responsible for each function,
who were involved in a series of meetings to
examine the status quo, steer decisions and
organise updates which were discussed several
times by the Executive Management Committee
(the highest managerial committee at Group
level, chaired by the CEO) in the CEO Jour Fixe (the
periodic update involving the CEO and his first line
managers) and presented to the CGN&S for their
review.

Our commitment to sustainability was presented
by the CEO in a press conference and in a call
dedicated to financial analysts and investors in the
month of November 2019.1°

This set of commitments and targets covering
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics
bear witness to how sustainability is part of our

: Group’s DNA and is fully integrated in our business

strategies. As such, it is recognised as a crucial
component of our bank’s success in the medium term.

All stakeholders are covered by our values.

We really care about execution, discipline and
transparency and favour long-term sustainable
outcome over the short-term solution.

The social component has also been enhanced

with our Social Impact Banking (SIB) project and its
geographical expansion together with a number of
initiatives undertaken by the UniCredit Foundation.

Our aim is to support financial access and inclusion
and create an engaging and positive working
environment.
