Compliance culture: our
prerequisite to make
the business healthy
and sustainable

At UniCredit, compliance is an inseparable aspect of

the Group’s business activities. Our commitment to
compliance is founded on our internal approach to
proper conduct, is consistent with our Group’s core values
and fundamentals and meets the expectations of our
customers, regulators, and society as a whole.

Reinforcing compliance

Compliance is a prerequisite to the legitimacy of

our business, therefore adherence to laws and regulations
is key to a sustainable business.

Compliance culture is essential to spread awareness

of what is or is not good to protect our clients and our
Group’s reputation.

At UniCredit we do not tolerate any misconduct and
non-compliant behaviour.

Regulations are part of our operational environment and
we must comply with them while remaining focused on
our customers’ needs.

In accordance with our Team 23 strategic plan, UniCredit
Compliance function enhances compliance as a tool for
managing risk and actions to mitigate non-compliance
risks more effectively, in particular with regard to
Anti-Financial Crime (AFC).

UniCredit compliance pillars

UniCredit’s 2019 Compliance Plan, approved by the Board
of Directors is based on six strategic pillars.

@ covernance

Reinforcing the oversight and steering mechanism is

one of our priorities. This is why we have increased the

implementation of specific actions such as:

« strengthening the interaction between Holding and
sub-holdings Companies and Legal Entities (LEs)

« stating that the same position can be covered for a
maximum of 5 years and for which each Compliance
Officer/AML Officer of the Group has a defined
succession plan

« strengthening the relevant Group managerial processes
and their extention to all LEs, making sure that they
are not only accurately designed but also correctly
implemented

+ consolidating the central steering of the international
Network.

@risk Presidium
Risk Assessment and controls are executed according to
a 3-year plan taking into account new regulations coming
into force as well as identified riskiest areas such as

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Financial Sanctions (FS).

The plan includes an updated version of the controls
catalogue to cover all relevant compliance areas. We
also rolled out new controls on Whistleblowing, ICT
compliance and outsourcing.

We also run our OFAC’ Compliance Programme. This

is based on guidance from US Authorities in FS and

other regulatory standards and guidelines. It is a

major Group-wide and bank-specific remediation and

enhancement programme to:

« strengthen our policies, procedures and controls related
toFS

* prevent and detect any future violations of applicable
laws.

FOCUS

Financial Sanction Forum

The dynamic framework of the sanction arena led to
the need for the development of a Sanction Business
Forum. Business, Compliance, Legal and Risk functions
are regularly involved in dedicated meetings where
they review corporate transactions. This confirms the
attention and awareness of our senior management

in ensuring a timely response to our customers and
mitigating the exposure to risks of sanctions.

Regulatory changes
Staying abreast of regulatory changes and promptly
identifying UniCredit’s obligations is essential for the
Group, which is why we monitor forthcoming regulations
before triggering the necessary implementation at
various levels. Over the year, Compliance continued to:

« lead the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Group Project to ensure full implementation of law
requirements

* support the setting up of business projects
implementing new regulatory requirements such as
Financial Benchmarks.

As for advisory activities, the Compliance Antitrust

Programme was refreshed at Group level and further

focused on payments and other transactional services, in

cooperation with our business functions. The complaints
reporting process, standards and related information
flows were enhanced, as well as the Compliance role in
the monitoring of activities related to the offer of non-core

products and the setting of related minimum requirements.

Compliance culture and People Development
UniCredit is committed to building and strengthening a
common culture of compliance across our organisation.
In working towards this goal, we reinforced our Tone from
the Top programme with a strong commitment from all
senior managers in spreading the importance of business
ethics and risk culture with a specific focus on Customer
Protection and Anti-Financial Crime.

In 2019 we also continued the Compliance for the Group
programme which aims at increasing proximity between
Compliance and Business through the regular discussion
of compliance subjects at senior management level.
This involved classroom workshops (approximately
18,900 attendees in 2019 across the Group), an education
campaign addressed to all employees, a dedicated
compliance culture Ambassadors Programme?

and continuous communication.

In 2019 a first group-wide Compliance Day took place
across 13 countries with 14 plenary sessions, the direct
involvement of branches in 7 countries and ad hoc
initiatives in CIB and UniCredit Services with an overall
reach of more than 50,000 colleagues. Colleagues were
involved together with the senior management in events
on Customer Protection, FS and AML.

5 web-based courses‘ and 7 classroom workshops on
Customer Protection and AFC were rolled out throughout
the year.

We are fully committed to fostering compliant behaviour
in each employee; at UniCredit the mandatory compliance
training is a requirement to access variable compensation,
if any.

: In 2019 UniCredit employees received 521,164
= hours of compliance training.

Our Purpose and Identity
» Risk Management and Compliance

As we believe in people and in the enhancement of their
skills, we invest in human capital through consistent and
regular planning of relevant initiatives.

At UniCredit we are all accountable for compliant
behaviour and must adhere to the regulations applied
in our business. We can also play an active role by
reporting any unacceptable behaviour and unlawful
acts. Whistleblowing is encouraged as each of us can
be the bank’s first line of defence. The Global Policy
on Whistleblowing has recently been updated. New
channels dedicated to third parties have been set up
and an extended description of Serious Reports in line
with the new escalation process has been submitted
to the Board of Directors of all relevant LEs. The policy
has also established a Whistleblowing Managerial
Forum at Group and local level. This Forum, which

is involved in cases of Serious Reports, periodically
monitors main trends, indicators and actions aimed
at enhancing awareness of the process and culture of
reporting misconduct.

Digital Transformation
We increased the usage of Artificial Intelligence (Al) to
improve key compliance processes, advisory services and
controls. We developed different solutions to increase
detection capabilities of possible suspicious transactions
or misconducts.

Finally, in 2019 we developed a group-wide IT solution
for managing advisory activities more efficiently to be
implemented in 2020.

FOCUS
