~ Risk Management and Compliance

Group’s commitment to the highest international
standards in this area. The document includes,
inter alia, a specific commitment to protecting
human rights, in alignment with the Group’s Code
of conduct and the general environmental and
social principles and in observance of the United
Nations Guidelines on Business and Human Rights.*

In 2019 more than 27,200 colleagues received
training in human rights, for a total of 29,252 hours.

With the safeguarding against reputational risks

at the forefront of our attention, during the year

we reinforced our governance on the subject. The

Group Reputational Risk Council, implemented in

2018, became a Committee in its own right in 2019.
The Group Reputational Risk Committee (GRRC) is
responsible for the assessment of the reputational risks
of initiatives, bank transactions, projects, customers
and other business activities. The GRRC supports the
Group Chief Risk Officer on governance guidelines for the
Management of reputational risk on sensitive sectors
and customer relationships, of related mitigation
actions and of all other relevant topics submitted by
the operational and reputational risk function. The
GRRC involves the proposing Business function together
with Group risk management, Group lending office,
Group compliance, Group legal, Group sustainability &
foundation and evaluates the participation of the CEO
and other relevant functions on a case-by-case basis.

In this context, the Defence Policy was updated to
enhance the related reputational risk assessment.

Reinforcing our Risk
Appetite Framework

The Group Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) defines
the level of risk that the UniCredit Group is willing to
accept in pursuing its strategic objectives and business

plan. It represents the anchor point for measuring

the risk in relation to capital, to liquidity, to business

strategies and the recovery plan. In this process

the RAF takes into account the macro-economic

environment, the competitive landscape and

regulatory requirements. It represents a sound risk
management steering tool across the Group and has
been strengthened further by recent improvements
made also in consideration of the goals of the new

strategic plan Team 23.

These enhancements are tangible in all areas of risk. In

particular:

« In credit risk: we will reinforce our risk discipline with
regard to the origination, underwriting and monitoring
of new loans. These efforts represent the continuation
of the conservative risk approach adopted by our Group
through Transform 2019. The RAF 2020 will include new
Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to better steer these
targets across both the Group legal entity and divisional
level;

« In liquidity risk: the RAF has been enhanced thanks to
the introduction of new KPIs aiming at better defining
the long-term strategy, ensuring an adequate buffer of
assets over the new strategic plan horizon to be used as
collateral for secured funding and steering the level of
intra-group exposure.

«In market risk: for 2020 RAF KPls, an enhanced
methodology for setting thresholds embedding the
stress test analysis will be implemented.

+ In non-financial risks: in addition to the inclusion
of climate change® and ICT & cyber risk, significant
improvements have been made by including
Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Sanctions in the
RAF.

Managing and
monitoring risks

In 2019 we reinforced our simplification efforts related
to the management of lending processes in our Group.
The activity was managed in cooperation with the
Group Lending Office (GLO) and Commercial Banking
Italy. As a result, product catalogue has been simplified.
For example, technical forms of collaterals have been
massively reduced (i.e. -89 percent for all customers).
The main advantages are: an easier product selection
for customers’ best interest, more time to dedicate to
customers’ needs, a decrease in operational risk and
simplified monitoring and product maintenance activities.
As a pan-European commercial bank, UniCredit’s main
risk exposure is reflected in its share of Risk Weighted
Assets (RWA). Its credit risk, at 88.3 percent, depends on
geographic areas and asset classes, while its operational

risk RWA and its market risk RWA account for €33 billion
(8.7 percent) and €11.5 billion (3.0 percent), respectively,
of its total RWA.

Over the course of 2019 we concluded and exceeded
the goals underlying the Transform 2019 plan in terms
of risk deleveraging. Performance was sustained by an
accelerated reduction in gross non-performing exposure
(NPE), down €12.9 billion (-34 percent ) during the
period, with a gross NPE ratio decreasing 268 bps to 5.0
percent, more than half the ratio of when we launched
Transform 2019. Since 2016, the decrease amounts to
€31 billion (-55 percent) coupled with an NPE coverage
increase from 55.6 percent to 65.2 percent (+ 961 bps)
thus confirming the strong performance and tangible
results on NPE. Moreover, the accelerated rundown
strategy of the non-core portfolio is well on track and
will be completed by 2021. This follows the already
significant reduction of €28.5 bn achieved since 2016.

A Loan Classification includes: Bad exposures: exposures to borrowers in a state of
insolvency (even when not recognized in a court of law) or in an essentially
similar situation, regardless of any loss forecasts made by the bank; Unlikely to
pay: classification in this category is the result of the judgment of the bank
about the unlikeliness, without recourse ta actions such as realizing collaterals,
that the obligor will pay in full (principal and / or interest) its credit obligations;
Non-performing past due: problematic exposures that are more than 90 days

Our Purpose and Identity
» Risk Management and Compliance

The main goal of liquidity management is to ensure ee
that the Group has a sufficient level of liquidity

to honour its payment obligations not only on an

ongoing basis, but also under stressed conditions.®

In 2020 the maturity of the first tranche of the Targeted @

Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) will be paid
back. The Group will keep a broadly balanced funding
gap evolution, particularly in the CEE Countries, while
supporting the volumes growth in Western Europe. The
funding plan will be mostly devoted to generating an
adequate buffer over the minimum total loss absorption
capacity (TLAC) and minimum requirements for own
funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). For this purpose, a
subholding company will be created to optimise MREL
requirements in the medium term. In general, the overall
intragroup exposure (not MREL related) will be reduced.

Fostering a sound
Risk Culture

UniCredit remains loyal to fostering a sound risk
culture throughout the organisation in order for
growth to be sustainable. An opportunity available to
all colleagues is the important training offer Group
Risk Learning Framework.® To this end, in 2019 a GRM
communication plan was developed which involved
two GRM and GLO web calls and a roadshow in
Vienna and Munich. Moreover, a specific campaign
on operational risk was completed in order to raise
further awareness amongst employees.

The intranet section of UniCredit GRM was updated
constantly during the year and tracked around
100,000 views.

In 2019 specific risk culture initiatives were also

dedicated to the Board of Directors:

« Induction Programme for Board members to ensure
continuous ad-hoc training (also for the benefit
of members of the Board of Statutory Auditors),
addressing both individual and collective Board
member needs

« Implementation of activities related to the Board
Training Programme Process Handbook, one of the
aims of which is to strengthen their knowledge of
key issues such as performance and risks.
