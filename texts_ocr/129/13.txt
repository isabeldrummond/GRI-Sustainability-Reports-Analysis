Strengthening
Risk Management

The current complex and demanding scenario calls

for a strategic and holistic perspective towards
managing diversified and, in certain cases, increased
risks. In accordance with this urgent need, in 2019 we
further strengthened our risk management approach.
Firstly, in alignment with the UniCredit operational

risk framework, we updated our methodology for the
identification and assessment of all the risks inherent to
our material products, activities, processes and systems
and developed a series of measurements, mitigation
policies, procedures and controls. Secondly, we took
steps to embed climate related risks and we reinforced
cyber risk protection. We also constantly work on all
the risks the bank is exposed to. These include credit,
reputation, liquidity, interest rates, compliance, the
environment, society and other emerging areas.

With regard to climate change, both scientific evidence
and the increasing stakeholder awareness on climate
issues make UniCredit’s action a priority. In this context
we are exposed to physical, economic, regulatory and
transition risks. These risks can have potential significant
credit, market and reputational consequences that
necessitate the development of a bank-wide climate

risk management framework. A very first step in the
achievement of this important aspiration was the
setting up of a dedicated team within the Group Risk

Management (GRM) office, responsible for the supervision
and management of processes related to climate
change risks and UniCredit’s approach to sensitive
sectors. The first activity put in place by the team focused
on assessing the transition risk of listed companies in

our Corporate & Investment Banking portfolio in order

to effectively manage their environmental risk profile.
Furthermore, a relevant methodology will be deployed for
other corporate clusters.

With reference to physical risk, preliminary analyses
have been started estimating most important
impacts connected with climate change risk.

Moreover, during the year, thanks to the continuous
cooperation between the business, risk and lending
functions, the firm commitment to sustainability

has also been enriched, supported by clear targets

for 2023? to address climate change related risks
including: assisting customers towards the transition to
a low-carbon emission economy; improving our policies
with regard to climate-related sectors; strengthening
our commitment to not supporting companies involved
in the deforestation of rainforests. In this way, some
quantitative indicators have been integrated into the
Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) 2020 to monitor the
achievement of the declared targets.

Over the course of the year the structure dedicated
to Information and Communication Technology
(ICT) & Cyber Risks has been further strengthened
with both internal and external resources to
incorporate a wider range of expertise even from
other industries.

During 2019, several courses of action were taken to
reinforce the Group’s cyber risk protection:

« the ICT operational risk assessments on
end-to-end business processes were completed
throughout the Group to comply with regulatory
requests

the weight of Key Risk Indicators (KRI) was
increased to adjust the ICT risk metric

a more forward-looking risk assessment
methodology was piloted in UniCredit and
UniCredit Services and will be released across the
Group in 2020. Recurrent monitoring of KRI on
relevant IT and cyber phenomena was established
and regular reporting managerial committees were
set up

periodical joint team analysis and meetings are
scheduled to ensure a common view of risks, root
causes and mitigation actions which are then
reported to senior management

we make use of internal and external sources to
perform a surveillance activity on external cyber
events in order to identify potential threats and
impacts on the Group

there is an ongoing process to identify the most
suitable approach to include cyber risk within the
2020 risk appetite framework process which will
be enhanced with qualitative statements and
indicators.

An insurance covering cyber events at Group level
has been renewed.

Over the years, we have continued to reinforce our
approach to human rights and we have evolved to
respond to the expectations of our stakeholders. The most
updated version of UniCredit Human Rights Commitment
is available on the UniCredit website and summarises

the Group's approach to human rights, focusing on some
stakeholder categories such as employees, customers,
suppliers and communities. It is based on international
declarations and conventions, standards, principles,
guidelines and recommendations, including The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour
Organization’s Fundamental Human Rights Conventions.
We are committed to fighting modern slavery and human
trafficking in our business and supply chains. In this regard,
UniCredit is also compliant with section 54 of the United
Kingdom's Modern Slavery Act 2015.2

At the beginning of the year, UniCredit signed

a Global Framework Agreement (GFA) with UNI
Global Union.? The agreement strengthens the
dialogue between the two parties on human rights
and fundamental labour rights and confirms the
