EP in facts - Volgafert

UniCredit, together with another bank, arranged SACE-covered financing for a 1,500 metric tons per day (500,000
tons per year) urea plant in Tolyatti, Samara region, Russian Federation (the Project). The Project will be built,
owned and operated by a joint venture between Russian fertiliser and chemicals producer PJSC Kuibyshev Azot and
Italian Maire Tecnimont SpA, whereby the latter also acts as EPC Contractor to the Project.

The Project will be constructed within an existing industrial complex owned and operated by Kuibyshev Azot who
will supply it with ammonia and carbon dioxide feedstocks produced in existing plants as well as with the utilities
from existing facilities. The Project will be built under a turnkey EPC Contract by Tecnimont SpA and will apply urea
production technology licensed from Stamicarbon BV, a subsidiary of Tecnimont.

The Project is being developed in compliance with Russian Federation requirements and the lenders’ environmental
and social standards, including the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards Performance
Standards, EP and OECD Common Approaches. Environmental and social due diligence (ESDD) for the Project

was conducted by a reputable external consultant on behalf of the lenders. It was based on the review of a set of
documents, including the Project Design Documentation by NIIK, a Russian Research and Design Institute of Urea
and Organic Synthesis Products and the EPC Contracts, as well as site visit observations and discussions with
relevant Project stakeholders.

In consultation with the lenders’ advisor, the Project was categorised as Category B in accordance with EP. Due

to its location on the industrial site the potential adverse, environmental and social risks involved are extremely
limited. These risks are ultimately specific to the boundaries of the sanitary protection zone and can be prevented
or significantly reduced by implementing the envisaged mitigation measures.

Actions were identified to close the gaps in those areas not found to be fully compliant with lenders’ applicable
standards. An Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) was developed and was made an undertaking of the
borrower under the facility documentation. Actions to be completed as part of ESAP include: the development of
appropriate management programmes to mitigate environmental, health and safety risks during the construction
phase; internal grievance mechanism; establishing necessary monitoring controls/programmes for the operational
phase (air control monitoring, soil and ground water protection) and other measures. Regular monitoring by an
Independent Environmental and Social Advisor of the ESAP implementation and of the environmental and social
status of the Project was agreed both for the construction and operation phase.

Compliance

How compliance is managed at UniCredit

The constant evolution of the international scenario and an ever more demanding regulatory framework
makes the Compliance function increasingly crucial and central for our Group. Indeed, its mission, under the
responsibility of the Chief Compliance Officer, is to monitor the management of compliance risk - in terms

of looking after the correct application of/and compliance with the regulatory framework, its consistent
interpretation at group level, as well as the identification, evaluation, prevention and monitoring of the
overall compliance risks - as well as to assist the Group, its management, the corporate bodies and employees
in carrying out their activities in compliance with mandatory rules, internal procedures and best practices.

In order to accomplish such goals, the Compliance office defines, develops and monitors both implementation
and adherence with compliance rules, procedures, methodologies, training and in particular, minimum
compliance standards to be followed and implemented within the Group. Moreover, within its mission,

it pursues the goal of being a valuable partner to the Business in terms of, on the one hand, ensuring the
necessary advice to deal promptly both with new regulations and with new emerging risks impacting on

the Bank’s strategic interests and, on the other hand, of enhancing awareness on conducting business in a
sustainable/ethical way compliant to rules.

The Compliance function is embedded in the second-level internal control system and pursues the goal

of preventing and managing the risk of regulatory non-compliance and conflict of interest with a view to
preserving the Bank’s reputation and its customers’ confidence and to contributing to Group Sustainability
(corporate value creation/consolidation). This it does through: strategic guidance (policies and opinions)
and support and monitoring (compliance risk mapping, preventive evaluation) on all compliance activities.
Moreover, by regularly interacting with the other control functions, especially in the prompt detection of
upcoming emerging risks, it ensures consistency in the functioning of the second level internal defense line.

Finally, in terms of complying with the new strategic plan Team 23, Compliance function is focusing on
enhancing compliance risk management and on making actions to mitigate non-compliance risks more

effective.
