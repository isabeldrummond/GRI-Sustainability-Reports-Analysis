Our general approach to credit underwriting is
based on the management of expected loss. We
also use new technologies, such as advanced
analytics, to support risk monitoring and automated
underwriting. Overall, we run the business with
robust credit risk strategies and policies and
adopting a tight monitoring of the portfolio through
clear risk drivers.

On NPEs, we continue to have a proactive portfolio
management approach, perfected since 2016: at the
end of 2023 Group gross NPEs will be below €20bn,
down almost €60bn since the end of 2015. This

will also help us to effectively deal with calendar
provisioning. The Gross NPE ratio is expected to be
below 3.8% in 2023.

In Team 23 we confirm our focus and we target
further actions on Compliance and Operational risk,
showing that Compliance and cyber security are
always at top of our agenda.

In terms of compliance, we are further enhancing
controls, processes and overall risk culture,
sponsoring the rotation of people between business
and control functions. We are also continuing to
boost oversight through strengthened centralised
compliance requirements.

: With regard to cyber security, customer data safety
i and security is UniCredit’s top priority and since

i the 2016 launch of Transform 2019, the Group has
: invested an average of €0.9bn per year in upgrading
i and strengthening its IT systems and cyber security.

In June 2019, the Group implemented a new strong
identification process for access to its web and
mobile services,’> as well as payment transactions.
We keep improving our processes and investing in
IT solutions to strengthen controls, placing a strong
focus on data protection and security. UniCredit will
also continue to focus on Data Leakage Prevention,
including the secure transmission of data among
employees and to third parties and the safe use of
cloud technologies. We are also exploring machine
learning techniques which will allow us to move from
sample-based point-in-time analysis to full real time
supervision, although we believe IT cannot be the
sole solution to the issue. From the operational and
reputational risk perspective, we reinforced controls
of business and governance processes across legal
entities, increasing our focus on operational and
reputational risk culture and control.

While we cannot have a control officer behind

every employee, we can have a guardian angel - the
corporate culture of the institution.

The main part of this pillar is our financial strategy. We
take a proactive approach, basing capital allocation on
financial performance at country, segment and individual
client level. In addition, we are aligning our domestic
sovereign bond portfolios to the average of European
peers, between 50 to 60 percent of Tangible Equity.

As concrete result of our actions, we will generate
€16bn shareholder value creation: €8bn capital
distribution and €8bn tangible equity increase. The
Capital distribution within the Group is managed to
optimize sustainable earnings generation, consistently
with our strategic targets.

In UniCredit value creation means more than just
generating financial values. It also means adding
sustainable value in terms of human capital, society
and the environment. For these reasons we integrate
sustainability into our business strategies.

Sustainability as part 9°"
of UniCredit DNA

Our values unite us and define our Group culture, ©
how we make decisions and how we act on them.

As One team, One UniCredit, we are convinced that

our two values, Ethics and Respect (E&R), represent ©
what is most important for the Group and for all our
stakeholders today; a simple guiding principle ensures

we follow these values every day and everywhere in

our business: Do the right thing! This guiding principle

is embedded in the UniCredit Group culture. We run

numerous training sessions and awareness campaigns

on this topic to ensure that all employees act as the
first line of defence for the bank.

: Financial results and the tangible actions we take in
: achieving them are certainly important, but equally

important is the way in which these results are
achieved.

Value creation for UniCredit does not just mean
generating financial value, but also adding value with

i regard to human capital, society and the environment.

UniCredit has been working on Environmental,

Social and Governance (ESG) topics for several years
and has made significant investments in terms of
managerial attention to these topics especially in the
field of governance.

A dedicated Board committee in charge of ESG topics
was created in 2016 by including sustainability in
the duties assigned to the Corporate Governance

and Nomination Committee, which since then has
been renamed Corporate Governance, Nomination
and Sustainability (CGN&S) Committee. It has been
discussing sustainability strategy and achievements
with a constantly growing attention in recent years,
in line with the increasing focus that both regulators
and investors are dedicating to ESG issues.

The year 2019 began with the approval of our Ethics
and Respect manifesto which was published both in
the 2018 Integrated Report and the Annual Report.
This was the first step of many representing and
reinforcing our commitment towards doing the right
thing in relation to all our stakeholders.
