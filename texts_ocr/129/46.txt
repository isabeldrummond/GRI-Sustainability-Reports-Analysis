In our new strategic plan Team 23, we have committed
to increasing our exposure to the renewable energy
sector by 25 percent by 2023 (to greater than €9 billion).

Promoting sustainable financial
instruments

UniCredit, lead manager of the first ever green bond,
continues to play a central role in this fast developing
market. In 2019 we acted as joint bookrunner in 29 issues
for an overall placement of €22 billion. Over the year, we
also saw growing demand for green and sustainability-
linked loans and credit facilities. UniCredit played a
bookrunner role in a total of 20 transactions for an overall
amount of roughly €31 billion. As clearly stated in our
new strategic plan Team 23, we aim to achieve Top 5
league table position in EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and
Africa) combined Green Bonds and ESG-linked loans.

Financing energy efficiency

As at 2019, our loans to SMEs through subsidised
Programmes in Western Europe (WEU) amounted
to €707 million, while to individuals to more than
€1 billion.

UniCredit’s commitment to EU energy efficiency
targets is also demonstrated by its engagement with
industry initiatives. One such initiative is the Energy
Efficient Mortgages Initiative (EEMI), promoted by

the European Covered Bond Council (ECBC) and the
European Mortgage Federation (EMF), and funded
via the European Commission’s Horizon 2020
Programme. EEMI aims to deliver a standardised
European framework and data collection architecture
for energy-efficient mortgages with favourable
financing conditions for energy-efficient buildings,
energy-saving renovations and anti-seismic
measures. In the Italian market, thanks also to the
representative role on behalf of the Italian Banking
Association (ABI) in the Steering Committee of ECBC,
UniCredit is, together with the Italian representative
of the EMF’s Executive Committee, one of two
coordinators for the Italian market hub. Such hub

is attended, among others, by banks, insurance
institutions, engineers, construction companies

and utilities interested in energy requalification.

Its leading position within the Italian market hub
facilitated UniCredit in designing agreements and
products addressed to energy requalification in Italy’s
buildings, already finalised in 2019. Unicredit is one
of the 52 lending institutions participating in the pilot
phase launched in June 2018 in order to reach the
definition of green mortgage,° achieved during 2019.
We are also one of the founders of Energy Efficiency
Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG).”

Our strategic plan Team 23 aims at increasing energy
efficiency loans to customers, by 34 percent for
Western Europe (WEU) SMEs and by 25 percent for
WEU individuals, while in Central Estern Europe (CEE)
our target is at least 6 percent for new origination of
energy efficiency loans.

Reduce our environmental impact

UniCredit’s solid governance system guides its
behaviour in favour of conserving natural capital,
which is consistent with its commitment to prevent
and mitigate any environmental impact of our
operations and lending activities.* Our Group holds
ISO 14001 certification through UniCredit Bank
Austria AG and UniCredit Bank Czech Republic and
Slovakia. Furthermore, UniCredit SpA is registered
under the EMAS Regulation.

Regarding our climate strategy, our two targets are
short and long-term: the first is to reduce our carbon

6. Green mortgages are intended to finance the purchase/construction and/or renovation of both residential (single family & multi-family) and commercial
buildings where there is evidence of: 1 energy performance which meets or exceeds relevant market best practice standards in line with current EU legislative
requirements and/or (2) an improvement in energy performance of at least 30 percent

term target is a reduction of 80 percent by 2030.9
In 2019, we achieved an overall reduction of 55

emissions.

2020

In 2019 we renewed our commitment to using new
technologies to reduce the environmental footprint,
costs and emissions of our operations. In 2019 we
closed 82 branches as we further reduced our office
space by 63,000 square meters in Western Europe.
Since the launch of Transform 2019, we had recorded
a reduction of our office space amounting to 352,000
square meters and the closure of 963 branches. We
thereby surpassed our original Transform 2019 plan
objectives by 2 percent and 6 percent respectively.
Our Team 23 plan envisages a further reduction of
the space we occupy.

In 2019, in Austria we reduced our energy consumption
by 55 percent versus 2018, especially thanks to spaces

Raising awareness on environmental
impact

UniCredit launched an awareness campaign on
environmental impact for all employees. All

the colleagues joined this year’s Global Week of
Climate Action by working together on September
20 and coming up with over 1,200 ideas on how

to protect our climate. These proposals ranged
from recycling and waste management to mobility,

energy efficiency, pollution prevention, eating
habits and raising awareness further. UniCredit
has appointed its Millenial Board"? to oversee the
comprehensive review and implementation of
these initiatives.

During 2019 the Plastic-free project was launched.
UniCredit is distributing re-usable metal drinking
bottles across the Group to reduce plastic bottles
use. All single-use plastic used in break areas

and canteens will be removed from all UniCredit
buildings by 2023. These actions will bring a
reduction of approximately 7 million plastic bottles
per year in Italy alone, saving about 500 tons of
co.. Furthermore, thanks to the purchase of 40,000
carbon neutral certified bottles, about 400 trees will
be planted through the partnership with Treedom,*?
an online platform which allows to choose a tree
and follow its plantation.

Increasing energy efficiency

One of our main initiatives to reduce energy
consumption is making UniCredit’s premises more
energy-efficient thanks to the last years actions.
Among the various methods used to monitor and
manage UniCredit’s energy consumption in Italy,
we have installed centralised remote-controlled
Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
systems in about 1,000 branches and energy
monitoring devices in 800 branches. In particular,
the former systems are used to remotely control
and optimise HVAC operation and thermal
comfort. Both systems detect energy consumption
anomalies, which are transmitted to system
providers to be resolved. Following European
Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, during
2019 UniCredit completed the Energy Audit on

25 sites. This audit was aimed at identifying

new energy efficiency interventions to improve
the energy performance in our bulidings to be
implemented during Team 23.

We are continuing to making our data centres
more energy-efficient. Although they are subject
to annual increases in use for IT-related activities,
their cooling systems, new uninterruptible

power supplies (UPSs) and overall engineering
are designed to avoid any increase in energy
consumption even as they meet heavier demand.
In 2019 the recorded power consumption at our
