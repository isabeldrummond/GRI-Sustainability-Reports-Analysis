Customer Experience

After years of experience and knowledge acquired through gathering insights from customers and prospects, in

2017 UniCredit defined a new approach, the Benchmarking Study, providing it with a view of the perception of our

clients and prospects on Customer Experience, Brand Reputation & Business Indicators in local markets. It allows:

+ a fair comparison between UniCredit and its competitors thanks to a random selection of clients by the research
provider (no client lists provided by the bank); no mention of UniCredit as survey commissioner (double blind
approach); mixed interviews of main and secondary bank clients

* a unique and comparable cross-country and segment view of the bank’s perception.

The new main KPI is the Net Promoter Score (NPS), a metric used across industries to measure customer
experience. It is based on the sole question - How likely are you to recommend our Bank to..., on a scale from 0 to
10? In the numeric scale, 0 corresponds to not at all likely and 10 to extremely likely. The score is calculated as the
difference between the percentage of Promoters (clients who gave a 9 to 10 score) and Detractors (clients who
gave a 0 to 6 score). Within the Benchmarking Study, the KPI is more specifically referred to as the Strategic Net
Promoter Score to clarify the goal in assessing the overall positioning on high level topics/areas. Differently from
last year, while the results of Customer First Index were reported, the table below shows the results of NPS for
UniCredit and its competitors.

In 2019 UniCredit positioning was significantly ahead of competition in 8 countries out of 12 for Individual segment
and in 7 countries out of 12 for Corporate segment.
