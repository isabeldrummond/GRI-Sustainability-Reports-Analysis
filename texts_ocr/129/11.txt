Thanks to the great team at UniCredit, the
Transform 2019 plan has been successfully
delivered, laying solid foundations for the new
strategic goals launched in December 2019 with our
new strategic plan Team 23.

Value creation for UniCredit does not just mean
generating financial value, but also adding value
with regard to human capital, society and the
environment.

Our business model allows our Group to interact
with the market environment in a sustainable way
and can easily be reproduced in every market where
our Group operates. This simple model enables

us to transform our resources and relationships

into results which, in turn, help us to achieve our
strategic goals and create value over the short,
medium and long term.

Serving our customers to the best of our abilities
continues to be our number one priority. To achieve
this, we rely on highly qualified, committed
employees and on our capacity to work together
effectively, creating the One Team, One UniCredit
synergy. We therefore remain committed to further
maximising productivity and delivering sustainable
returns for the future.

Our value creation process also relies on robust
business ethics. Our Ethics and Respect values,
together with our simple guiding principle to do
the right thing, are applied to everything we do
at all times and are at the core of our stakeholder
interactions to generate sustainable results. We
work to manage our financial, human, social and
relationship, natural and intellectual capital in a
responsible manner.

: At UniCredit the way we achieve results is just as
: important as the results themselves.

Understanding how the company’s capitals,
strategic pillars and business model are
interconnected and interact is the key to our

path towards integrated thinking, essential for

the correct development of our value creation
process over time. This means being able to detect

Our Purpose and Identity
~ Our Value Creation over time

changes in the external environment, including
evolving stakeholder concerns, climate change
and the limitation of natural resources, in order to
find internal responses to address expectations,
generate value and to make the organization more
resilient.

In this process, listening to stakeholders is of the
utmost importance. Intercepting their needs and
expectations can orient us towards making the
right decisions regarding our offer of responsible
lending products, savings, payment and investment
products, thus enabling individuals to improve their
quality of life and financial stability. We also provide
funding to small, medium and large businesses

and contribute to financing the development of

key sectors, contributing to economic growth, job
creation and innovation in the countries where we
operate.

By fostering financial literacy, promoting inclusion
and gender equality and conserving natural
resources, we promote the well-being of individuals
and protect the environment. As a result of our
approach, and guided by our business model, we
also contribute to achieving the United Nations’
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).? We monitor
our progress towards the SDGs via measureable KPIs
resulting from the management of material topics
and related risks and opportunities.

The core of our business is therefore to support
customers and stakeholders in managing social
and environmental challenges and financing
their investments for a sustainable future. More
than ever, sustainability forms a central part

of everything we do and is fully integrated into
our business and decision-making process, in
accordance with the strategic sustainability targets
announced in November 2019.’ These will be
achieved by involving all business structures and
under the guidance of our Board of Directors and
senior management.

To support this endeavour, our Five Fundamentals
remain, and shall remain, the behaviours we expect
our employees to follow in order to reach our
targets.
