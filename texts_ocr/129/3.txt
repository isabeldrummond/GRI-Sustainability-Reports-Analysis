Dear Stakeholders,

2019 was a very important milestone for UniCredit, although tinged with sadness for all of us in the
Group. Our chairman Fabrizio Saccomanni, who was integral to the success of the Group, suddenly passed
away this summer. Fabrizio was a friend of great intelligence and humanity, highly competent with a
fine sense of culture and wit. His premature death was a Great loss for us all and he is much missed.
In September Cesare Bisoni was elected chairman and | am extremely grateful to him for leading the
continuing constructive work of the board.

4 UniCredit + 2019 Integrated Report

We successfully concluded our three year strategic plan, Transform 2019, launched in 2016, exceeding
many of our initial targets. This success is thanks to the drive and unwavering commitment from all our
team members and the support you, our shareholders, have shown us throughout the plan. This is a
Great achievement and | am proud of the results and the truly transformative work that has been done.
To share our success and show appreciation to our shareholders, we are pleased to propose an increased
capital distribution for 2019, returning 40 per cent — 30 per cent as a cash dividend and 10 per cent
through a proposed share buyback.

This is double the target we set ourselves in 2016. We have shown that, no matter what, at UniCredit we
say what we do and do what we say. We will apply the same mindset and dedication to our new plan,
Team 23.

Although Transform 2019 was based on conservative assumptions, there were some challenges faced by
the financial services sector over the past few years that could not have been foreseen.

Headwinds from unexpected geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic volatility and higher regulatory
pressure added to an already testing environment.

At UniCredit, we took a series of decisive actions to counter these unforeseen events, enabling us to
successfully execute our business strategy, delivering on our key targets.
