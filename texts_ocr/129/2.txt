Report structure

UniCredit has prepared this document in compliance with the requirements of Art. 3 and 4 of the Legislative Decree 254/2016,
which implements European Directive 2014/95/EU in Italy, and is part of UniCredit’s principled effort to further develop its
compliance with the European Commission's Guidelines on non-financial reporting and advance understanding of all aspects of its
business.

The Integrated Report (the “Report”) has been approved by the Board of Directors of UniCredit SpA on March 5", 2020 and has been
produced by the Group Sustainability & Foundation function, in collaboration with the Strategy and M&A function. Since 2017, in line
with the requirements of Legislative Decree 254/2016, a specific policy was adopted to define the roles, responsibilities, activities
and controls and to coordinate the flow of information between the parent company, regions, divisions and legal entities in relation
to the process of preparing the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (“NFS”). As foreseen by Article 5 of the Legislative Decree
254/2016, this document constitutes a separate report marked with a specific heading, to allow its reconciliation with the NFS
required by the regulation.

The Report should be considered in its entirety, including its Supplement, which is here enclosed or available in the Sustainability
section of our website (www.unicreditgroup.eu) and contains a number of essential indicators and underlying quantitative data.

The guidelines adopted for the preparation of the sustainability information included in the 2019 Integrated Report, including its
Supplement, are the “GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards” and the “Financial Services Sector Disclosures,” issued, respectively,
in 2016 and 2013 by the GRI - Global Reporting Initiative. The performance indicators reported in accordance to the guidelines
adopted are included in the “GRI Content Index” section. The principles contained in the International <IR> Framework, published in
December 2013 by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), were also used as reporting framework.

Figures and information relating to the Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 classes of greenhouse gas emissions have been prepared in
accordance with “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate, Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition, 2004)” as well as
the “GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards.”

The information in the Report addresses the issues that were identified as material and their associated indicators, which reflect
the main economic, environmental and social impacts of the Group or could have a substantial influence on the views and decisions
of its stakeholders. The materiality analysis, updated in 2019, was fundamental to the Report and determined the topics to be
reported on, in line with stakeholders’ needs. Following the analysis of the relevant topics indicated in Article 3 of the Legislative
Decree 254/2016, the use of water was not considered significant for the representation in this NFS.

The content of this Report refers to the year 2019 and, in particular, to the activities of UniCredit during the year, unless otherwise
stated. Figures relating to previous years are provided for comparison and refer mainly to the 2018 fiscal year.

Concerning the reporting perimeter, in line with previous years the legal entities consolidated on a line by line basis by UniCredit SpA
have been analyzed in order to identify the relevant companies and ensure the Report would provide a proper understanding of the
Group’s activities, development, performance and relevant impacts. In particular, with reference to year 2019, data and information
related to FinecoBank S.p.A. and Ocean Breeze Energy GmbH & Co. KG have been excluded from the reporting perimeter, following
the deconsolidation of FinecoBank S.p.A. and the sale to Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets of the 100% of Ocean Breeze
Energy GmbH & Co. KG, finalized on May 10, 2019 and in December 2019 respectively. This new reporting perimeter represents 98
percent of Group’s FTEs. Community contribution and initiatives in support of Communities included in the “Social and relationship
Capital” chapter include data and information related to UniCredit Foundation - Fondazione di studio in onore del Cavaliere del
Lavoro Ugo Foscolo (the “UniCredit Foundation”), not included in the perimeter of the consolidated financial statements. The data
reported in the paragraph of the Supplement “Compliance - Whistleblowing” refers to the legal entities currently monitored and
considered relevant by Group Compliance. For figures related to staffing and calculations of the Value Added, the perimeter of the
Report corresponds to the 2019 consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. Any conditions that may limit the
scope of the data are clearly disclosed throughout the Report.

To ensure reliability, the Report includes directly measurable quantities and limits the use of estimates as much as possible.
Potential estimates are based on the best available information or spot checks. Restatements of previously published figures that
have been provided for comparison are clearly indicated as such.

This Report has been externally assured by an independent assurance provider in accordance with the criteria established in the
principle “ISAE 3000 Revised”. Its conclusions regarding the compliance of the information provided with Article 3, paragraph 10, of
the Legislative Decree 254/2016 are set out in a separate external assurance report. The procedures followed for the assurance of
the NFS are disclosed in the “Report of the External Auditors”, included in this Report.

During 2019, we made further steps towards the completion of our path of integrating more and more sustainability into our
business plans and strategies, in line with the strategic sustainability targets announced last November 2019, and that we

plan to achieve with the involvement of all the corporate functions and under the guidance of the Board of Directors and senior
management. For the main targets and commitments, for the description of the strategic approach to relevant non-financial issues
as well as for the principal generated or perceived risks in relation to those issues and how they are managed, please refer to the
relevant Chapters of this Report.

With reference to climate change, both scientific evidence and increasing shareholder awareness have made taking action a priority
for UniCredit. Under such circumstances, UniCredit has adopted the recommendations issued by the Task Force on Climate-Related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD). For further information concerning the actions undertaken from UniCredit in this regard, please refer to
chapter Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Integrated Report.
