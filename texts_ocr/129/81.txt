Health and safety management*

Health and safety at work is a key topic which has been so fully integrated into our work-life balance strategy

that we far exceed our legal obligations. This must be seen as a core value with the ultimate goal of guaranteeing
well-being at work through a combination of actions and systems.

With this in mind, UniCredit signed a specific Joint Declaration on Work-Life Balance in 2017. This declaration aims
at sharing with employee representatives a defined set of Group target standards reflecting a socially responsible
corporate approach, while taking into account the special requirements, current local best practices and standards
of individual geographies that have already been met.

These commitments were further confirmed in the Global Framework Agreement on Human Rights and
Fundamental Labour Rights signed on 22 January 2019 with UNI Global Finance, the global trade union for the bank
and insurance sectors.

In compliance with EU directives, local laws, regulations and signed agreements in all the legal entities that make
up the UniCredit Group, the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management System aims to monitor and
carry out activities to identify and mitigate the effects of the dangers that can lead to accidents and occupational
illnesses. To further minimise residual risks, continuous improvement actions are carried out.

UniCredit has adopted and successfully implemented an OHS Management System for the identification, within its

organisational structure, of responsibilities, procedures, processes and resources for implementing the company

policies. The risks to the health and safety of employees are evaluated according to a multidisciplinary approach,

considering the combined effect of the working environment, processes and equipment as well as the subjective

conditions of workers.

The health and safety risk management process comprises the following phases:

+ identification of dangers and their classification

+ risk assessment

« identification and preparation of prevention and protection measures and procedures

¢ definition of an action plan as part of a programme to guarantee the improvement of safety levels over time, with
the identification of the competent company structures

« execution of the planned measures as part of the programme

¢ definition of worker information and training programmes

* monitoring the implementation of the programmes and checks on the application and effectiveness of the
measures adopted

* management of residual risks.
