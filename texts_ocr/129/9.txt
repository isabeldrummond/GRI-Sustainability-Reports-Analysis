Disseminating the importance of business
ethics and risk culture: OU first Group-wide
Compliance Day took place across 13
countries with an overall reach of more than
50,000 colleagues.

We endeavour to create an engaging and positive
working environment in order to do the right thing
for our colleagues. Driven by the E&R principle,
UniCredit recently updated the Global
Policy on Whistleblowing.

From a Human Capital perspective, two

new Global policies were issued for our
employees: one against harassment,
sexual misconduct and bullying, the
other against acts of retaliation. These
new policies lead to a greater awareness on
unacceptable behaviours and promote a ‘speak
up’ culture where all employees feel listened to
and protected when reporting misconducts.

We are continuously improving the quality of
service for our Customers and are committed
to data protection and privacy.

New channels dedicated to third parties have been
set up and an extended description of Serious
Reports in line with the new escalation process
has been submitted to the Board of Directors of all
relevant Legal Entities.

Creating an engaging and positive
working environment is also managed
via dedicated initiatives, which is why
UniCredit set up its first group-wide
Diversity and Inclusion Week, fostering
an inclusive culture across 15 countries and
involving around 13,600 colleagues.

In 2019 an extensive internal campaign on E&R was carried out to boost engagement:
