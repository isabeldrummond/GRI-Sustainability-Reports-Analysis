Adherence to legal standards and voluntary codes
relating to marketing and communications

UniCredit follows the Code of Marketing Communication Self-Regulation (www.iap.it) disseminated by the Istituto
dell’Autodisciplina Pubblicitaria (IAP), which commits its subscribers to transparent and honest advertising
practices.

UniCredit is also a member of the Utenti Pubblicita Associati (UPA) which supports the IAP. All UniCredit entities

follow the regulations disseminated by these bodies, particularly when local codes do not provide guidance on
topics covered by the UPA.

All advertising and communication activities at UniCredit are managed by our Group Identity & Communication
department, which is responsible for assuring the effective application of the IAP’s code, as well as the oversight of
the UniCredit’s Supervisory Body.

In advertising related to investment products, all texts are submitted to the Commissione Nazionale per le Societa

of truth and transparency.

Sustainable and Responsible Investments (SRI)

Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI) and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics are a major
part of our Group wealth management investment strategy. For us SRI means creating value for financial investors
through a strategy with a long-term horizon and, which, in assessing enterprises, institutions and countries
integrates financial variables with ESG variables.

The fund selection process that has been structured is rigorous and in recent years has also included ESG
investments. The aim of the process is to cover all classes of funds and take into account also the internal market
view and asset allocation decisions.

Five different categories of ESG investments have been identified, based on customer needs: Exclusion and Norm
Based Agreements, ESG integration/Best in class, Thematic Investments, Engagement and Impact Investing. If
the aim of clients is to exclude some business sectors, certain funds will be presented to them, while for clients
interested in engagement others will be selected. This approach reflects our service model: listening to customers
and proposing them the best investment strategies that reflect their objectives including sustainable funds

The funds selected are constantly monitored in relation to risk and performance, and if an ESG fund is involved,

it needs to be continuously checked to make sure it is consistent with the approach indicated by the manager
during the due diligence phase. If the characteristics for which the funds were selected cease to exist, then they are
immediately excluded from our buy list.

ESG investments also represent a diversification opportunity for all customers: the identified funds tend to be
constructed differently compared to funds with a traditional approach and can improve in some aspects the
portfolio risk-return profile.
