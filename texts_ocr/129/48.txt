Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

Sustainability matters to us and we consider it a key lever for our future business strategies
and an essential component of our bank’s success. For this reason since November 2019
we have supported the recommendations of the TCFD, created by the Financial Stability
Board (FSB), which aims at developing voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk
disclosures for use by companies in providing information to stakeholders.

Governance

For several years now UniCredit has been working
on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)
topics and has made significant investments in
terms of managerial attention to them, especially
in the field of governance.

As with ESG issues at large, climate change is dealt
with by a dedicated Board committee created in
2016 and in charge of ESG topics.

The inclusion of sustainability amongst the duties
of the Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee determined the new name Corporate
Governance, Nomination and Sustainability
(CGN&S) Committee. In particular, it discusses
sustainability strategy and achievements which are
overseen by the Board of Directors.

This decision responds to the need to raise the
level of responsibility on the topic and make

it more effective and integrated in the overall
corporate strategy. The Executive Management
Committee (EMC), chaired by the CEO, is the
highest managerial committee appointed by the
Board which comprises representatives from key
business functions and divisions. It ensures the
effective steering, coordination and control of
Group business as well as the successful alignment
of the parent company with the different
businesses and geographies regarding strategic
topics including environmental issues concerning
the Group.

The EMC thereby presides over, and is directly
responsible for climate change topics.

Climate-related issues are scheduled in the
agenda of at least three meetings of the CGN&S
Committee every year.

Sustainability presents specific topics to the CGN&S
Committee after sharing the contents with the CEO and
reports on implementation progress.

A Great effort was dedicated to the preparation of the
Team 23 strategic plan, as 2019 was the final year of the
former plan Transform 2019. During this process climate
change was an important part of the discussion.

In fact, starting with the requirements of the
CGN&S Committee and the Board of Directors, our
senior management team was focused on further
integrating sustainability topics into the business
strategies of our Group.

Group Risk Management, Retail and Corporate

Business lines both in Western Europe and Central &
Eastern Europe (CEE), Corporate & Investment Banking
(CIB), Investor Relations, Internal Communications,
Media Relations and of course Group Sustainability

and Foundation are all involved in the definition of a
coherent strategy to fight climate change and develop
appropriate indicators to be tracked over time under the
oversight of the CGN&S.

The process is closely followed by the senior managers
responsible for each function and involved in a series
of meetings to examine the current state of affairs,
steer decisions and organise updates which are then
discussed in the EMC during the CEO Jour Fixe (the
periodic update involving the CEO and his first line of
reporting) and presented to the CGN&S for their review.

The CGNA&S is also responsible for monitoring and

overseeing progress of the goals and targets set
according to the process above.
