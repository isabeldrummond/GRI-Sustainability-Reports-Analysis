The Joint Declaration on Responsible Sales (May 2015) promotes joint principles and guidelines regarding
UniCredit’s commercial approach, defining the pillars on which they can be shared and respected: product quality,
customer focus, employee professional development and organisational governance.

The Joint Declaration on Work-Life Balance (November 2017) aims to promote a set of specific, concrete actions to
support work-life balance across the Group. The document calls for a general approach to setting target standards
in all of UniCredit’s legal entities and in all of the countries where the Group is present, with five areas of focus:
digitalisation, space and time flexibility, time management, well-being and cultural change.

The implementation of every Joint Declaration is subject to periodical monitoring, both by UniCredit and the EWC’s
employee representatives.

The parties commit to ensuring the broader dissemination and implementation of the content of these documents
throughout all Group countries, with the common purpose of using social dialogue to reinforce Group culture, taking
into account special requirements and current local best practices in addition to standards that have already been
met.
