Our Strategy

Strategy

Last November 2019 UniCredit announced a
set of sustainability targets embedding several
commitments on climate change.

Climate change poses significant threats to the
sustainability of our business.

Shifts in consumers’ preferences towards
climate-friendly products could affect our strategy
and imply financial stress for our customers, both
in terms of turnover and additional costs to align
their products with such shifts. Furthermore, our
customers may be obliged to incur additional
expenses to implement new technologies
compliant with arising regulations. For this reason
we are partnering with our customers in the shift
to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy, in
particular through:
¢ setting a more stringent framework for fossil fuel
financing
¢ increase of renewable energy sector exposure
+ increasing energy efficiency loans to customers.

The strong commitment to partnering with clients
is also demonstrated through the nomination of

a new Sustainable Finance Advisory Team within
our CIB division which combines sustainability
expertise with capital markets execution to deepen
client dialogue on ESG topics and facilitate their
access to Europe’s green financing market.

UniCredit is working with all its team members and
the banking industry to make sure that banks always:
Do the right thing, also for the environment.

As a first step towards performing a proper
scenario analysis, UniCredit is partnering with the
global think tank 2° Investment Initiative (2°ii)

in road-testing their Paris Agreement Capital
Transition Assessment (PACTA) methodology

in a pool of 17 international banks. Originally
developed to assess the exposure of both equity
and bond portfolios to transition technologies
across key sectors, a research programme to
expand the model to the banks’ corporate lending
portfolios has been launched by 2°ii .

96 UniCredit + 2019 Integrated Report

The road-testing of the PACTA methodology will
start in the first quarter of 2020 to be completed
by the first half of 2020.

The methodology allows banks to study the
alignment of their portfolios with climate
benchmarks. The use of asset-level databases
allows the matching of economic assets with
unlisted financial assets. This will enable
participating banks to overcome the data challenge
for large lending portfolios associated with
non-listed counterparties and other counterparties
for which climate-related data is not readily
available in a homogenous and low-cost way.

Any misalignments will be represented at

sector, technologies and counterpart level and
road-testing banks will be able to leverage the
methodology for reporting and steering potential
capital misallocation, in order to be aligned

with the 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. The
underlying matching software and calibration
for matching instruments will be made publicly
available at the end of the project.

: UniCredit has committed to fully exit thermal

? coal mining and cease support to coal-fired power
=: generation projects by 2023.

A new coal policy was approved and published
in November 2019 which prohibits new projects
in thermal coal mining and coal-fired power
generation and imposes strict commitments in
terms of reducing reliance on coal for corporate
customers.

The Global Policy foresees specific criteria for
completing a reputational risk assessment,
depending on the transaction characteristics
(projects versus general financing, new projects
or clients versus projects or clients already in our
portfolio, coal-fired power plants versus thermal
coal mines) and based on required evaluations of
specific environmental standards and thresholds
(e.g. compliance with environmental standards
and objectives of the project, level of reliance on
coal-fired power generation and existence of plans
to reduce such reliance, percentage of revenues
coming from mining activity and existence of a
strategy to reduce such percentage).

Our Strategy

~» Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

The Global Policy is applicable in all countries and

provides guidelines with reference to:

¢ financing of coal sector projects lending or other
forms of financial assistance with a disclosed
use of proceeds in supporting projects related to
Coal-Fired Power Plants (CFPPs) or thermal coal
mines, including coal trade finance transactions,
also covering additional cross-sell that is
connected to coal trading, shipment and storage

¢ general financing, advisory services, or other
forms of financial assistance (corporate loans)
where the associated purpose is not directly
linked to a coal-fired power plant/project or to a
thermal coal mine.

The Policy provides restrictive guidelines on:
1.Coal sector projects
a. no new projects will be financed
b. projects already existing in our portfolio will
not receive new financing or the provision of
new financial services.
All existing contractual commitments will be
honored until maturity, ie. UniCredit Group will
gradually let existing projects phase out on the
basis of the existing contractual obligations.

2.General financing, advisory services, or other
forms of financial assistance for Coal-Fired

Power Generation (CFPG) companies:

a. criteria for onboarding new clients: the Group
can engage with new clients only if their
current coal capacity is lower than 30 percent
and they have a clear strategy to reduce
reliance on CFPG to less than 5 percent by
2025

b. as far as existing clients are concerned:

if their current installed coal power capacity
is higher than 30 percent, the Group requires
that clients clearly commit to reducing their
share of installed coal power capacity at
least in line with Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDC) of the country in which
their operations are located

if their current installed coal power capacity
is lower than 30 percent, the Group requires
an annual update on commitments to reduce
the clients’ share in future years.

3. General financing, advisory services, or other
forms of financial assistance for thermal coal
mining companies:

a. criteria for onboarding new clients: the Group
can engage with new clients only if their
revenues from thermal coal mining are lower
than 25 percent and in any case a critical
case by case assessment must be performed.
Financial support can be granted only if clients
have a reasonable strategy to diversify their
profile

b. as far as existing clients are concerned, the
business relationship can continue if their
revenues from thermal coal mining are lower
than 25 percent and they have in place a
reasonable strategy to diversify their profile.

4. Other companies involved in the coal sector will
be also evaluated. If more than 30 percent of
the revenues of these companies (e.g. suppliers)
are connected to coal-fired power generation/
thermal coal mines, the Group will verify that
the client has a reasonable strategy to diversify
in place.

If the above-mentioned criteria on existing
clients are not met, UniCredit will gradually
phase out of the relationship.

In order to strengthen our approach on fossil fuels,
also a policy covering the Oil and Gas (O&G) sector
has been approved and published in November
2019. It identifies the Arctic and Non-Conventional
O&G (NCOG) industry sector and defines the rules
for the reputational risk assessment.

The Arctic Oil & Gas activities are defined as

the extraction of Oil and/or Gas performed in

the region inside the Arctic Circle (66.5 degrees
North of the Equator). The financing to extraction
activities in the Arctic region is strongly limited;
in particular, the Group considers on-shore and
off-shore extraction of oil and off-shore extraction
of gas as environmentally critical Arctic activities.
