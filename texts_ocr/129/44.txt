Our Strategy
> Intellectual Capital

Our cyber security strategy centres on a continuous
improvement model and a dedicated process and
policy framework so as to respond effectively to

the dynamism of the threat landscape and evolving
regulatory requirements. Furthermore, it is cyclically
monitored both internally and through third party
assessments.

Over 400 full-time equivalents (FTEs) are dedicated
to ICT security activities and operations, marking an
increase versus 2018. Prevention and risk mitigation
initiatives undertaken in 2019 included a new
antivirus solution to tackle advanced endpoint (e.g.
laptops) threats, and reinforcing protection measures
against sensitive data exfiltration. Furthermore, we
implemented an enhanced user behaviour analysis
solution to strengthen the effectiveness of alarms,
and optimised monitoring and detection of specific
threats. An automated security risk assessment
solution for repositories was also applied.

We also focused on alignment with regulatory
requirements. These activities included

enhancing our SWIFT infrastructure to meet new
Customer Security Programme requirements, and
implementing new strong customer authentication
measures for online and mobile channels

requiring either a onetime password or biometric
identification, in line with Payment Services
Directive 2 (PSD2) obligations.

Employee awareness of cyber security risks is key. In
2019 about 39,000 hours of dedicated training were
provided Group-wide (of which over 9,000 in Italy)
and we intensified knowledge sharing through our
Group intranet portal, including 9 educational videos.
We also ran a phishing simulation campaign involving
around 36,000 employees in UniCredit SpA.

The aforementioned measures, together with other
actions, aim at reducing the likelihood and impacts
arising from cyber-attacks and ensuring that

they are governed effectively. For example, upon
detection in 2019 we immediately investigated,
reported and managed an incident involving a

file generated in 2015 containing a limited set of
personal details within the Italian perimeter. No
information permitting access to customer accounts
or unauthorised transactions was lost.°

Going forward, our Team 23 strategic plan includes
further investments in reinforcing identity and access
management, third party services, cloud security and
cyber security culture, amongst other priorities.

Optimise processes
and services

Continued investments in process improvements enable
us to be more efficient, to the benefit of our clients.

Our Paperless Bank programme?® plays a fundamental
role in our new strategic plan which envisages
transformation to a digital operating model, leveraging
straight-through processing opportunities in particular.
Through its deployment our clients will benefit from
an improved customer experience thanks to the
convergence of traditional in-branch transactions to
simpler and quicker digital solutions and products.
Moreover, in-branch processes will be significantly
optimised through complete dematerialisation of
documents, reducing operational risk and increasing
efficiency.

In 2019 we finalised dematerialisation of cashier

desk transactions in our Italian branches. All such
transactions can now be digitally signed. In addition

to transactions, almost 50 percent of other in-branch
documents for individuals customers were digitally
signed in 2019. Our Austrian and German branches are
at an advanced stage in the dematerialisation of cashier
desk transactions and dematerialisation activities have
also begun in the CEE region. These changes marked a
saving in excess of 130 million sheets of paper across
our network, equal to approximately 15,000 trees,’ and
will support our environmental sustainability goals as
the programme progresses.®

Our Best Practice Sharing and Convergence programme
works to identify and replicate internal best practices,
fostering best-in-class processes and accelerating
progress. Best practices in strategic areas of our
business, such as customer experience and our
Paperless Bank programme, are identified through a
rigorous benchmarking process. They are subsequently
documented in explanatory videos and a virtual library
so as to share knowledge across the Group. To date,
results of the programme include:

{} ~50 best practices identified

RA out of 250 initiatives collected

either fully or partially, in other banks
of the Group

“e, ~70 local best practices replicated

In 2019 communities of practice were introduced,
promoting practice sharing as expertise and fostering
cross-team cooperation. The Global Data Science
community is an example.® Its roughly 500 members
members share experiences, practices and real use
cases, collectively learning and developing across key
Group initiatives.

We apply data science in our Advanced Analytics
Lab (AALab) programme. Leveraging big data
architecture and data analytics, the programme has
the objective of boosting business decision-making
processes through the use of data. More specifically,
it aims to enhance our relationship with our

clients, support risk presidium and overall controls,
and improve efficiency. The AALab, involving
cross-functional virtual teams, utilises a centralised
big data platform permitting data to be acquired
from multiple sources and transformed through to
final analytics. It is currently working on about 20
use cases, advising on and supporting areas such as
sales effectiveness, credit risk detection and process
efficiencies.

Transform by innovating

We are committed to developing cutting-edge
solutions to provide an innovative and competitive
service.

Our Group Transformation Office coordinates our
activities in the field of innovation, supporting
strategic decision-making and the definition of
Group-wide priorities. Moreover, it scouts innovative
solutions and monitors their implementation.

The identification and evaluation of innovative
ideas and solutions is supported by the Group
Transformation and Innovation Advisory Board
(TIAB).2° Acting as both advisor and challenger, the
TIAB reviews key transformational and innovation-
related initiatives from across the Group regarding
critical topics such as data analytics, fintech
collaboration and innovation management. Its
members include external experts in areas such
as security and risk mitigation, fintech ecosystems
and consumer trends, alongside UniCredit’s senior
leaders.

Our Strategy
~ Intellectual Capital

: The TIAB met 3 times in 2019 to discuss our new data
i strategy and customer experience model, amongst
= other topics.

We maintain a high focus on fintechs, leveraging new
technologies to enhance our processes and customer
offering. To facilitate scouting and testing of fintech
solutions, in 2019 UniCredit established a partnership
with Plug and Play, a global innovation platform
bringing together start-ups and corporations from

main market sectors. A number of pilot initiatives were
launched as a result in areas such as our customer
offering for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), client
onboarding and regulatory compliance technology.
Moreover, as a member of Plug and Play’s Frankfurt and
Milan Hubs, thereby in two of our core markets, we are
well placed to act as innovation partner for our clients
including corporates and SMEs, connecting them to the
Plug and Play ecosystem through tailored initiatives.

In 2019 buddybank, UniCredit’s new banking model
designed exclusively for smartphones available

in Italy, released the first personal loan service
designed exclusively for mobile users. Simplification
of the product concept and full digitalisation of

the underlying processes allows customers instant
and complete access to the offer. Through the app
customers can independently manage all phases

of the product purchase, including plan simulation,
providing necessary documentation and activating the
loan, as well as accessing post-sales services.

We also significantly innovated payment services
through cooperation with traditional partners
(Mastercard) and Big Techs. Customers in a number
of countries are now able to use UniCredit cards in
conjunction with Apple Pay, Google Pay and Alipay
and further rollouts are in the pipeline.

Our activities in 2019 to fulfil PSD2 regulatory
requirements included implementing measures

for certified Third Party Providers (TPPs) to access
accounts upon customer authorisation. At the same
time, we seized PSD2 provisions as an opportunity to
innovate our services so as to meet clients’ changing
needs, initiating development of multibanking
functionalities. Once completed, our clients will

be able to aggregate accounts held in other banks
and make third party payments directly from our
channels, simplifying the customer experience.
