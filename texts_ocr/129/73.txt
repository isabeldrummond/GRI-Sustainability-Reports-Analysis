Whistleblowing

In 2011 we adopted a system implemented at Group level which provides employees with a way to report unacceptable
conduct (i.e. whistleblowing). By unacceptable conduct we mean any action and/or omission performed during

the working activity that could in any way affect it. This could be a violation of bank activity rules or any violation
that causes or could cause damage or bias to UniCredit and/or its employees. Any employee can make use of this
mechanism to report a reasonable suspicion of unlawful conduct that could be potentially harmful or detrimental
to the Group or its employees.

The Group’s approach to whistleblowing is set out in a specific Global Policy. In order to promote a corporate culture
based on ethical behaviour and good corporate governance, the Policy governs reports of unacceptable conduct by
employees within the Group.

The Policy is intended to:
¢ grant a corporate environment where employees may feel free to make reports on unacceptable conduct
define adequate communication channels for the receipt, analysis and use of the reports.

The management of this process is designed to ensure the greatest possible protection and confidentiality of the

identity of the whistleblower and of the accused individual and to prevent any possible retaliatory or discriminatory

behaviour in response to the report.

At local level, for example in Italy, UniCredit SpA has identified the Head of Group Compliance CEE, ABC,

Governance, Education & Business Management, as the person responsible for internal whistleblowing systems

and for ensuring that the procedure is followed correctly. If the people referred to above are hierarchically and

functionally subordinate to the person to whom the whistleblowing report relates or if they themselves are

accused of violation or if they have a potential interest in the report that would compromise their impartiality and

independence of judgment, then they may contact Internal Audit directly as the reserve function.

The channels (some of which are available 24 hours a day) provided by UniCredit SpA for employees to make

whistleblowing reports, anonymously - if desired, are as follows:

« by phone. The UniCredit SpeakUp line allows the employee to leave a voice message report with an option to
remain anonymous

- on the website, where the UniCredit SpeakUp web service allows the employee to submit a written report with an
option to remain anonymous

by e-mail to the UniCredit Italy Whistleblowing e-mail address

« by letter to the dedicated UniCredit Italy Whistleblowing postal address

« by physical meeting.

In June 2019 a new Policy was issued which introduces the opening of the whistleblowing channels to Third Parties.
