Italy

An entrepreneur benefitted from microcredit to start a craft brewery where he employed ex-prisoners from
the Rebibbia prison in Rome. Along with the former prisoners and several volunteers, a young brewer has also
been employed. In addition to the production laboratory, the social enterprise has opened a pub to favour the
rehabilitation in society of its employees. Even in product research, the company relies on circular economy
principles, using ingredients recovered from mass retail food waste.

During 2019, the Group SIB approach was extended to 10 other countries, maintaining consistency with the defined model.
All banks followed the model in its entirety with limited exceptions.
