The UniCredit Board of Directors is composed of 14 members, including the Chairman and the Chief Executive
Officer.*

In compliance with the current Italian and European provisions applicable on such topics, also concerning the time
commitment and the limits upon the maximum number of offices that Directors may hold, the Board of Directors
establishes its qualitative-quantitative composition deemed to be optimal for the effective completion of the
duties and responsibilities entrusted to the body with strategic supervisory function by law, by the Supervisory
Provisions and by the UniCredit Articles of Association. The Board also establishes the requirements that the
UniCredit Directors shall meet, in addition to possessing those envisaged by current provisions.

Before appointing the body with strategic supervisory function, the Board informs the shareholders about its
composition deemed to be optimal in order that the expertise required may be taken into consideration in the
choice of candidates. However, shareholders may carry out their own assessment on the best composition of
the supervisory body and file their own candidacies consistent with the same, explaining their different proposal
vis-a-vis the analyses carried out by the Board.

With regard to the following:

« the qualitative and quantitative composition of the Board of Directors and the profile of candidates to the position
of Director

« the time commitment recommended for an effective attendance at the Board and Committees meetings

« the limits upon the maximum number of offices established by the provisions of the Capital Requirements
Directive IV (Directive 2013/36/EU dated 26 June 2013, CRD IV), amended by the Directive 2019/878/EU dated 20
May 20 2019

« the gender composition criteria for the body with strategic supervisory function

reference can be found in the document Qualitative and Quantitative Composition of the Board of Directors of

UniCredit, published on the Company’s website, Governance section.

The composition of the Board qualitatively and quantitatively corresponds to the theoretical profile. In detail, also
in light of the information given by the persons concerned, the requirements concerning, inter alia, experience,
integrity and independence,° as well as the time commitment recommended for an effective attendance at the
Board and Committees meetings and the limits upon the maximum number of offices that Directors may hold
established by the provisions of the CRD IV Directive, were accounted for.

The Director’s personal qualities, as well as age and gender diversity (the female component is above the
applicable requirements) fully comply with the indications in the theoretical profile. Furthermore, with reference
to professional expertise gained in the areas of competence envisaged by the profile, all areas of competence were
represented in the Board and the experience possessed by all the Directors is in line with the requirements of the
profile, given the good understanding and experience in more than two of the required areas of competence.

The positions held by the Board Members in other companies listed on regulated markets (both in Italy and abroad)
as well as in financial services companies, banks, insurance companies or other large companies, are referred to in
the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure.

In order to support the Board of Directors, also pursuant to the provisions of the Italian Corporate Governance
Code for listed companies, four Committees® are established, vested with research, advisory and proposal-making
powers diversified by sector of competence:

+ the Internal Controls & Risks Committee

« the Corporate Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee

> Governance

In detail, the Internal Controls & Risks Committee, the Corporate Governance, Nomination and Sustainability
Committee and the Remuneration Committee have been set up in compliance with the provisions of the Bank
of Italy Supervisory Regulations on banks’ corporate governance envisaging three specialist Committees — one
on appointments, one on risks and one on remuneration. The Related-Parties Committee is established for
overseeing issues concerning transactions with related and associated parties, in compliance with the relevant
Italian Companies and Exchange Commission (CONSOB) regulatory provisions and the Bank of Italy Supervisory
Regulations, carrying out the specific role attributed to independent Directors in the aforementioned provisions.

The Committees’ duties are undertaken based on terms of reference and procedures set forth by the Board.

Board self-evaluation

In compliance with the provisions of the Bank of Italy Supervisory Regulations on banks’ corporate governance,
and also pursuant to the provisions of the Italian Corporate Governance Code for listed companies, the Board
of Directors undertakes a regular self-evaluation process at least once a year. It is focused on the adequacy of
the Board itself and Board Committees in terms of composition and functioning, tangibly measured in specific
theme-based areas, with special reference to those relevant to sound and prudent management.

In particular, it is focused on:

+ qualitative and quantitative composition, size, degree of diversity, educational background, experience (including
managerial), seniority in the current position, a guaranteed balance of non-executive and independent members,
adequacy of the appointment processes and selection criteria, and ongoing professional development

« meetings, frequency, duration, attendance levels and form of participation, sufficient time available to dedicate
to the assignment, degree of trust, collaboration and interaction among members, awareness of the role of Board
member, and the quality of debate at Board meetings.

The self-assessment process is undertaken with the assistance of an external consultant chosen taking into
account skills, expertise in the field of corporate governance, and the need for neutral, objective and independent
judgment, which are the hallmarks of the self-assessment process.

Induction initiatives and recurring training

In UniCredit a permanent induction programme is active for the Board members, also for the benefit of the Board of
Statutory Auditors members, based on three-year cycles connected to the Board mandate, with the aim of ensuring
ad hoc training on a continuous basis that takes into account both their individual and collective needs.

The induction programme, which is put in place with the support of an external consultant, includes both sessions
aimed at fostering the integration of new Directors and recurring trainings to preserve over time the expertise
needed for the proper fulfilment of their duties.

In addition, individual training plans will be activated, should they be deemed necessary, to strengthen specific technical
knowledge and expertise and to increase the level of diversity and the collective experience of the Board of Directors.

Training sessions and in-depth study initiatives in 2019 focused on topics of strategic relevance, business and relevant
organisational structures, knowledge of macroeconomic scenarios, development of markets as well as legal and
regulatory topics, with the aim of assuring awareness and knowledge of the risk profile adopted by the Group.

More specifically, inclusion programmes for newly appointed members of the corporate bodies were provided. Training
schemes focused on the in-depth examination of the above-mentioned topics and specific meetings focused on the
perspectives and key elements for both Group and the entire European banking sector strategies were also prepared
and implemented (open to the members of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors).

Furthermore, specific initiatives for the in-depth examination of topics falling within the competencies of the Board
Committees have been devoted to members of each Committee.
