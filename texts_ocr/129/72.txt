Main legal actions regarding anti-competitive behaviour, antitrust and monopoly practices*

Country Description of main legal actions, 2019

Germany and Italy During 2019 UniCredit SpA and UniCredit Bank AG received a Statement of Objections from the European
Commission referring to the investigation by the European Commission of a suspected violation of antitrust
rules in relation to European government bonds. The subject matter of the investigation extends to certain
periods from 2007 to 2012, and includes alleged activities by UniCredit Bank AG in a part of this period.
The Statement of Objections does not prejudge the outcome of the proceeding; should the Commission
conclude that there is sufficient evidence of an infringement, a decision prohibiting the conduct and
imposing a fine could be adopted, with any fine subject to a statutory maximum of 10% of the company’s
annual worldwide turnover.

UniCredit SpA. and UniCredit Bank AG had access to the entirety of the European Commission’s file on the
investigation from 15 February 2019 onwards. As a result of the assessment of the files, the Bank regards
it no longer remote but possible, even though not likely, that a cash outflow might be required to fulfill a
potential fine arising from the outcome of the investigation.

UniCredit SpA and UniCredit Bank AG responded to the raised objections on 29 April 2019 and participated
in a hearing before the European Commission on 22-24 October 2019. Proceedings are ongoing. There is no
legal deadline for the Commission to complete antitrust inquiries.

Country Update on legal actions listed as ongoing in the 2018 Integrated Report

Italy In April 2016, the AGCM notified the extension to UniCredit (and to 10 more banks) of the proceedings |/794
ABI/SEDA opened in January vis-a-vis the Italian Banking Association (ABI). The proceedings is aimed at
ascertaining the existence of alleged concerted practices with reference to the Sepa Compliant Electronic
Database Alignment system (SEDA).

On 28 April 2017, the AGCM issued a final notice whereby it confirmed that the practices carried out by

the ABI, UniCredit and the other banks in connection with the adoption of the SEDA service model of
compensation constituted an anti-competitive practice and therefore a violation of European competition
regulations. With such notice, the AGCM ordered the parties to cease the infringement, submit a report
evidencing the relevant measures adopted by 1 January 2018 to the AGCM, and refrain from enacting
similar practices in the future. Given the fact that the infringements were minor in light of the legislative
framework, the AGCM did not impose any monetary or administrative sanctions against UniCredit (or the
other 10 banks) also in consideration of the fact that, in the course of the proceeding, the ABI and the banks
proposed a redefined SEDA service remuneration model which, if correctly implemented by the banks, is
expected to decrease the current SEDA costs by half, which benefits the enterprises utilising the service
and, ultimately, the end-users of the utilities. UniCredit decided to appeal the AGCM decision at the TAR (the
Italian Regional Court).

The appeal is still pending.

Hungary The Hungarian Competition Authority (GVH) began a cartel investigation of 7 Hungarian banks, including
UniCredit Bank Hungary Zrt, in connection with foreign currency mortgage loan repayments (early
repayments). In 2013, the GVH fined UniCredit Bank Hungary Zrt. HUF 306,300,000 (roughly €1 million).
The Bank appealed against such decision and the appeal was rejected at first and second instance.

In December 2016 in the framework of judicial review the Supreme Court (Curia) instructed the Competition
Authority to conduct a new procedure over fines it had levied on Banks. The Competition Authority
reimbursed the fine paid by the Bank in 2013.

In the new proceeding the Hungarian Competition Office re-calculated the fines as a result of which the
amount of the fine was reduced to HUF 185,000,000 - regarding UniCredit (approx. €572,200). The amount
of the new fine is roughly 60 percent of the original fine. The Bank appealed against the decision to achieve
further reduction of the fine. In December 2019, the decision has been postponed to February, 2020.

In 2012, the GVH began a cartel investigation on the Hungarian Banking Association, the International
Training Centre for Bankers and 38 Hungarian Banks (including UniCredit Bank Hungary Zrt), all of which
participating in the BankAdat system, the interbank database for Hungarian credit institutions. At the end
of the investigation, UniCredit Bank Hungary Zrt was not fined but the Hungarian Banking Association was
fined HUF 4 billion (roughly €13 million) and the International Training Centre for Bankers was fined HUF
15 million (roughly €48,000). In the event they cannot fulfil their payment obligations, participating banks
that were the objects of the investigation (including UniCredit Bank Hungary Zrt) will be responsible for the
payment jointly and severally.

HBA and most of the affected banks appealed against the decision.

On 10 September 2018 the court decided to repeal the decision and close the proceedings, without any
fines. GVH did appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision and the action is ongoing.

Romania On 27 November, 2017, the Competition Council dawn-raided the headquarters of several banks (including
UniCredit Bank S.A.), financial non-banking institutions, leasing companies (including UniCredit Leasing
Corporation IFN S.A. and UniCredit Fleet Management), professional associations and employer association
working in the financial services market. The dawn-raids were conducted within the framework of two
investigations opened by the Competition Authority on the operating lease service market and, respectively,
on the financial services and consumer credit market.
The investigations is almost completed by the Authority: on December 2nd, 2019 UniCredit Leasing
Corporation IFN S.A. submitted to the Competition Council the observations to the Investigation Report. The
observations aim at rebutting the alleged infringement by object and by effect.

A. The cases reported refer to administrative procedures. For further information related to pending legal actions please refer to the Consolidated Financial
Report 2019, section B. Legal risks.

Privacy management

UniCredit ensures its compliance with data protection rules by adopting the principles set forth in the Italian
legislation implementing the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and the Data Protection Code -
Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, as amended by the Legislative Decree No. 101 of 10 August 2018, through dedicated
internal rules, in particular, the Global Policy on Privacy (which replaced the previous version of the Global Compliance
Guidelines on Privacy) issued in March 2015. The Policy was updated in March 2018 to comply with the new GDPR (EU
Regulation 2016/679) and further updated in April 2019.

Within the scope of data protection activities, the Compliance Risk Assessment and the second level controls
performed by UniCredit are aimed at identifying, monitoring and managing compliance risks in this regulatory area. A
data protection risk assessment group-wide was performed in 2019. A second level control catalogue will be further
improved in order to cover new processes (e.g. right to be forgotten).

Furthermore, the Data Protection Office works with the Security Governance function in order to incorporate certain
flows/results of security controls related to data processing within the overall GDPR Risk Assessment.

At Group Level UniCredit has developed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) Community and a Data Processing Agreement

(DPA) at Group level. The DPO Community is a community developed in order to ensure that the DPOs of the various
