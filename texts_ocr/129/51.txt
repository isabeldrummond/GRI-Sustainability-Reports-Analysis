Our Strategy

~» Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

Risk assessment in this case is related to the
transition of companies’ business models to

a low-carbon economy, the risk being a loss

of financial assets on exposure to companies
potentially subject to environmental regulations
if they are unable to repay debt.

In terms of piloting, we are analysing CIB listed
companies sub-portfolio data (about 30 percent of
the total in terms of EAD of given portfolio) while for
remaining companies we are applying proxies based
on sector and size of the company.

Once the methodology is developed, our target is
to map the transition risk of our portfolio and the
estimation of impact on credit indicators.

The process will naturally be extended to the
rest of the portfolios embedding the check of the
impact on earnings in the credit review.

Metrics and Targets

As already mentioned, understanding transmission
mechanisms of potential misalignment to
transition technology into financially measurable
risk is still underway.

Therefore it is premature to set proper targets
which could represent a safe haven portfolio
composition.

: However, as climate-related financial risk is a

: certainty, we have set some preliminary targets

i based on our overall sustainability strategy. In future
: TCFD disclosures we will track our progress in this

: field in alignment with best practice development

} and the industry standards as they materialise.

Our commitment to sustainability was presented
by the CEO in a press conference and in a call
dedicated to financial analysts and investors in the
month of November 2019.’

This set of commitments and targets covering
ESG topics is witnessing how sustainability is part
of our Group’s DNA and is fully integrated in our
business strategies.

As such, it is recognised as a critical component of
our bank’s success in the medium term.

The set of targets to which UniCredit is committed
also covers climate change issues, which is
increasing also in terms of the materiality analysis
both from a stakeholder and internal approach
point of view.

This shows how our CEO and senior management
are pushing on the enhancement of our bank’s
attitude to climate change.

While we are closely observing the development of
industry methodologies to define synthetic metrics
to measure portfolio decarbonisation in alignment
with the Paris Agreement goals, we have also set
specific targets which we will closely monitor

over the years in accordance with the framework
presented above.
