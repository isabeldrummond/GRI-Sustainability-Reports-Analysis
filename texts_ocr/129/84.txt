Handling complaints

UniCredit’s approach to complaint management is driven by the belief that continuous dialogue and rapid
responses are fundamental to addressing and improving the quality of our service and customer satisfaction.

Customers can submit their complaints through a number of channels, including email, written letter or in person
at one of our branches. Complaints are then managed locally or centrally, depending on the subject and nature of
the complaint.

As far as verbal complaints are concerned, we aim to improve the efficiency of our responses to various events
(errors, delays, malfunctions and churn rate); rapid resolutions increase customer satisfaction and strengthen its
confidence in the bank.

The adequate management of complaints is fundamental to achieving operational excellence and reducing risks.
Complaints may highlight areas where service quality can be improved - with positive effects on risk mitigation.
In addition, effectively and efficiently managing complaints is an opportunity to re-establish a satisfactory
relationship with customers.

As per our Global Compliance Guidelines - Complaint Management, a complaint is any form of dissatisfaction
expressed by a current, potential or former customers, which can be clearly identified regarding the manner in
which the Group has managed a banking, finance or insurance transaction or service. Each UniCredit legal entity
develops and regulates its own complaint management processes and defines the methods and timing applied
to settling complaints in accordance with the type of complaint and the means of communication chosen by the
customer.

A. Relating to EU Countries, in order to identify disadvantaged areas, we used the NUTS classification (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics: a hierarchical

system for dividing up the economic territory of the EU). In particular, we considered those regions at level 2 of the NUTS classification whose GDP (Gross Domestic
Product) per inhabitant is less than 75 percent of the Community average (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/GDP_at_regional_tevel).
Based on this classification, there are no sparsely settled or economically disadvantaged areas in Austria and Germany.

B. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Russia and Serbia, we considered as disadvantaged areas the whole territory, since for a study

of the IMF published in October 2017 these countries are considered emerging markets and developing economies (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/
Issues/2019/10/01/world-economic-outlook-octaber-2019).
