2 data centres in Verona was in fact 20.7 million
kWh and 15.1 million kWh respectively, which
puts the performance of our UPSs at the top of
the efficiency curve, resulting in a slightly lower
consumption than the previous year. Activities for
further savings are already planned for 2020. Data
centre’s power usage effectiveness (PUE) ratio are
shown below.??

UniCredit believes the use of renewable energy
is vital for tackling global climate change. In

2019 nearly all of the electricity purchased in
Italy, Germany and Austria came from renewable
energy sources: 100 percent in Italy, 100 percent in
Germany and 92 percent in Austria. At Group level
renewable sources represent 81 percent of total
electricity consumption. UniCredit commits that
all electricity consumption in buildings in Italy,
Germany and Austria will come from renewable
sources by 2023.

Managing mobility

We are continuing to promote smart solutions
that enable remote meetings. Desktop video
communication tools are available for all branch
managers and, in some countries such as Austria
and Russia, for all staff. All employees at UniCredit
headquarters have access to video conference
facilities and state-of-the-art video technology has
been widely adopted for online meetings.

Our Group travel policy encourages the use of
public transport. For example, the train is always
recommended as opposed to the aeroplane. During
2019 we were able to reduce travel costs by 3
percent compared to previous year.

Cars assigned for business and personal use are
subject to strict rules in Italy. Cars must be in line
with or exceed the European emission standards
protocol in force. Spiders, convertibles, coupés,
pick-ups and sports cars are not allowed.

A pilot project was launched in 2019 for the
€-charging stations across some Italian Head
Offices.

The pilot project included a gradual replacement
of traditional fuel cars with new electric and hybrid
vehicles and the installation of charging stations to
be used for corporate cars.

According to our data, the widespread adoption of
flexible working solutions in Italy has saved over 5
million km in employee commuter travel over the 4
years since their inception.

FOCUS

Mobility management Austria

The new Climate Protection with Business Trips,
Vehicle Fleets & Co. report by the environmental
organisation Greenpeace has carefully examined
business trips and work routes within the Austrian
financial sector. Bank Austria is positively
highlighted in this relationship, among other
aspects, for logistics and the general organisation
of its new headquarters. In fact, Austria Campus
is a best practice model owing to its many
eco-friendly solutions:

+ optimal connection with public transport

« filling stations for electric vehicles in parking lots
* concept that promotes work from home

* numerous parking spaces for bicycles.

Bank Austria is also sending a strong signal on the
subject of business travel. In fact, out of all the
financial institutions of the Report, it achieved the
highest reduction in the number of business trips,
equal to three quarters of journeys in the period
2008-2018, a result which even exceeded the target
set. In the same period total CO, emissions fell by
about 65 percent, a goal Bank Austria achieved by
declaring rail transport - provided connections are
available - the compulsory means of transport within
Austria for employee business trips.

Cutting consumption

By reducing consumption of materials, we can
increase our overall sustainability. A prime area for
reduction is the use of paper which we can limit
by making greater use of digitalised processes and
services.\*

Our Centralised Document Dematerialisation (CDD)
Project aims to make handling branch documents
more efficient and secure by developing a
Management process based on a new IT platform.
The project is based on scanning and digitally
storing contract documents and transaction
confirmations in order to create a highly
automated data system.

This process began with a pilot phase in January
2017 which digitalised selected contracts. It is

in place for all branch finance documents (e.g.
deposit forms and government bonds purchases).
As at 2019, the CDD securely stored almost 26
million documents. The CDD is further supported
by FirmaMia** which our customers can use to
digitally sign their routine in-branch documents.

In alignment with our Team 23 plan targets, the
Italian retail network will be paperless by the second
half of 2020, for what concerns key products Austria
and Germany will be paperless by 2021 and CEE by
2023.
