Business Model

in action

The banking sector is constantly evolving, with regulations, macroeconomic conditions and
customer behaviours changing at a rapid pace. Banks are transforming their business model
and the way they deliver value to customers. It is on these foundations and by virtue of the
commitment of the UniCredit team as a whole that we successfully delivered the Transform
2019 plan. This is why we have called our new strategic plan Team 23.
