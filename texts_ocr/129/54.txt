305-6 — Emissions of ozone-depleting substances In line with applicable

(ODS) regulations, where
necessary UniCredit
continues to replace
refrigeration and cooling
systems that contain ozone
depleting substances. In
recent years some episodes
of refrigerant gas leakages
have occurred in Germany
and in Hungary and the
relevant GHG emissions
have been calculated and
included in Scope 1 figures.
In 2019, in Germany, 332 kg
of refrigerant gas leakages
were recorded (R134a,
R407C, R410A, R422D),
amounting to 0 tons of CFC
11 equivalent; in Hungary
66 kg of refrigerant gas
leakages were recorded
(R134a), amounting to 0
tons of CFC11 equivalent.
