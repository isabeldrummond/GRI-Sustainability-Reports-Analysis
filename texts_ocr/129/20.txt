Our Strategy
~ Stakeholder Engagement

Thanks also to this reinforced and more reliable
methodology, we have been able to share these
results at senior management level and in several
meetings of the Board of Directors and the Corporate
Governance, Nomination and Sustainability
Committee (CGN&S),’ thus providing a complete
overview of ESG topics and our sustainability
approach.

Indeed, 2019 was a defining year for UniCredit in
terms of approach to sustainability which was more
deeply integrated into our business strategies.
Sustainability is part of our Group’s DNA and

a key component of our business model. Such
commitment, together with the growing global
focus on topics such as climate change, was a
strong driving factor in this transformation, further
heightened by an increased attention on the part of
regulators and institutional investors. By virtue also
of observations received by the CGN&S Committee,
these signals were promptly detected by UniCredit
which quickened its pace in addressing ESG matters,
as demonstrated in our new strategic plan Team 23.
Thanks to the effective sponsorship and direct
involvement of the CEO and senior management
team, in November 2019 a process involving the
Corporate Investment Banking, Risk Management,
Human Capital, Investor Relations and Identity &
Communication (among other functions) resulted in
a press conference and a dedicated call for investors
and financial analysts in which the commitments and
targets highlighting our sustainable strategy were
communicated.

UniCredit continued to leverage the materiality
matrix as a tool to support business strategy. In 2019,
in order to update the analysis, together with our
usual stakeholder listening sources, we also applied,
as we did the year before, information sourced by the
Datamaran tool. This allowed us, through external
sources, to investigate the main laws and directives
that impact the financial sector in all the countries
where the Group operates, to analyse the latest news
on issues related to the financial sector on online
media and social networks such as Twitter, and to
benchmark our report versus reports published by
other banks.

The analysis was therefore strengthened and as a
result of the above-mentioned announcement on ESG
targets, sustainability topics are now increasingly
integrated in our business strategy.

The analysis of the internal relevance of single topics
was conducted directly with senior management

in dedicated interviews. During these one-to-one
meetings, managers assessed each material topic
from a presidium, investment and managerial focus
point of view, defining a unique UniCredit approach
on such issues. By applying this new process, we
wanted to underline how fundamental materiality
analysis is to the strategic definition of UniCredit’s
targets.

As announced last year, a great deal of attention was
given to two material topics in particular: Business
ethics and Positive impact on society. The successful
results achieved with Transform 2019 have led

us to confirm our commitment to those material
issues also for this year. Furthermore, UniCredit has
broadened its focus to encompass topics related to
climate change, diversity and inclusion in its new
strategic plan.

Regarding Business ethics, Ethics and Respect: do the
right thing! are the values and guiding principle on which
the behaviour and decisions of our bank are founded.
Several initiatives have been undertaken during the

last year giving proof of the strong commitment to our
values. In the framework of the new strategic plan Team
23, these values combine with underlying assumptions
on sustainability to continuously strengthen our
approach, as demonstrated by the targets disclosed in
the announcement of November 2019 on three main
material topics:

+ Climate change

+ Positive impact on society

+ Diversity and inclusion.

With regard to Climate change, we will work closely
with our customers in the transition to a low-carbon
emission economy. In fact, we have confirmed the
decision for the complete decommissioning of
thermal coal mining projects for energy production by
2023 and are committed both to increasing exposure
to the renewable energy sector and supporting the
growth of energy efficiency loans to customers.

We aim to achieve Top5 league table position in
EMEA combined Green Bonds & ESG-linked loans.
Moreover, we will continue to reduce our
environmental impact by cutting greenhouse gas
emissions, among the targets for the Team 23
strategy, as well as committing to source all our
electricity consumption from renewable energy.’

Regarding Positive impact on society, the

Social Impact Banking (SIB) project successfully
disbursed more than €100 million in supporting
microentrepreneurs and social enterprises in Italy.

It was extended to 10 additional European markets
and UniCredit has committed to approving €1billion
of total financing by 2023. The project also provides
financial education and as at 2019 about 38,600
students were supported in 300 schools and more
than 2 million of training were provided.’

We will also continue to invest in UniCredit
Foundation that contributed over €5.6 million in
2019 towards social needs, including study and
research.

Diversity and inclusion has always been a focus

for UniCredit. In order to further enhance our
commitment on this topic, UniCredit will work with
different associations to launch an initiative for the
European banking sector. This consists in setting and
monitoring specific objectives so that banks increase
the proportion of women and minorities among

their employees: we believe that including different
perspectives helps improve processes and behaviours
and creating a positive and inclusive workplace is

key to innovation and growth. This attitude can only
strengthen the Group’s reputation and help it to
attract and retain key talents.

All these actions are a fundamental part of our
sustainability strategy and demonstrate how
sustainability is part of our way of thinking and a key
component of our business model. We must never
forget that the way in which we achieve results is just
as important as the results themselves. It is essential
that we always: Do the right thing!

We believe that fully integrating our sustainability
approach into our business strategies allows us to
respond promptly to the risks and opportunities
arising from material issues.

In addition, as illustrated in the following pages,
an attentive assessment of our initiatives and their
positive impacts on society has allowed UniCredit
to actively contribute to the achievement of the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
