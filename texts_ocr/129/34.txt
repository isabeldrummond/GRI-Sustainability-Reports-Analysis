Foster engagement

Our employees represent our Group’s strongest
asset and their engagement is essential to our
viability.

Listening and involving

To ensure colleagues are constantly aligned with
our goals, extensive communication was carried
out on our Group intranet informing employees of
the key elements of our new strategic plan Team 23
launched in December 2019. This communication
reached the record number of more than 70,000
page views after only three days publication. Our
senior management subsequently cascaded these
important strategic messages to our population
Group-wide.

: In order to gain a better understanding of the internal
: climate in light of the new Group strategies, our new

i People Survey, originally scheduled for 2019, is set to
} be launched at the beginning of 2020.

During the course of the year, we involved all
colleagues in our internal campaign on sustainability
matters by soliciting their views and ideas on how to
be more sustainable.’

FOCUS

UniCredit Millennial Board

The Millennial Board was established in 2019 and meets
quarterly in order to raise awareness of millennials’
views on banking topics and to explore innovative ideas
and solutions. The Board is composed of colleagues
aged between 22 and 32, coming from different areas
of the Group and of eight different nationalities. Each
member is supported by a mentor from the same

area. They also share their views on important matters
such as the challenge of attracting and managing the
millennial generation, ethics and sustainability. In their
role they will oversee the comprehensive review and
implementation of more than 1,200 initiatives proposed
by our employees for a more sustainable future.*

Building a positive work environment
In line with our Ethics and Respect values, at UniCredit

we believe in creating an engaging and positive working
environment based on respect and work-life balance.

Oe

In line with such commitment, in 2019 we issued

two new global policies: one against harassment,
sexual misconduct and bullying, the other against
acts of retaliation. These new policies lead to a greater
awareness on unacceptable behaviours and promote a
‘speak up’ culture where all employees feel listened to
and protected when reporting misconducts.

We strive to provide our employees with a wide and rich
welfare offer to meet fundamental health and family
needs and focusing always more on personal needs which
may change during the life cycle.’ In 2019 we raised
further awareness of existing and new initiatives through
a global welfare communications campaign which ran for
eight months, outlining our diverse and comprehensive
offer, using local testimonials and stories covering

topics such as healthy lifestyle, employee assistance
programmes, time management and flexibility.

Enhance skills

We strive to be an employer of choice, investing in
attracting, managing and developing talent. We want
to be a company where people can fully deploy their
skills, abilities and qualities.

Attracting talent

To guarantee sustainable support for the
transformation of the Group, we continue to invest in
the best available talent on our markets.

In the last three years, UniCredit has hired
approximately 200 promising young graduates through
its Impact Group Graduate Programme, which assures
dedicated development paths.
