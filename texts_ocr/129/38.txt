Our Strategy
~ Social and relationship Capital

In 2019 the key regulatory debates in which UniCredit
was involved include:

the European risk reduction package review

which aims to reduce the risks in the EU banking
sector. This comprehensive package of reforms

was adopted by the EU institutions in May 2019.

It includes, inter alia, measures to increase the
resilience of EU banks and to improve their lending
capacity to support the economy

regular discussion with the European Central Bank
and other European institutions concerning the
proposals to introduce additional provisions for new
Non Performing Loans (NPLs). In these discussions
we aim to mitigate the impact of the proposed
measures and their consequences for our customers
constant discussion with policy makers in order to
establish an EU-wide framework for sustainable
investments. From the very beginning, we
supported a practical, scientific-based, flexible,
progressive and proportionate taxonomy, to be
applicable by 2022. In addition we participate

in working groups on sustainable finance set up

by organisations such as the European Banking
Federation, the Association for Financial Markets in
Europe and the Institute of International Finance.

In 2019 our investor engagement included 452
meetings and 37 roadshow days with institutional,
retail and socially responsible investors.

In addition, we maintained an ongoing interaction with
sustainability rating agencies, in response to increasing
requests by investors for greater transparency, more
stakeholder engagement and stronger sustainability
Management. Our sustainable performance is reflected
in the key external ratings we received in 2019.

74 UniCredit + 2019 Integrated Report

 

Our Group remains committed to strengthening
protection of consumers and improving their
awareness. In Italy Noi&UniCredit, our longstanding
partnership with national consumer associations in
place since 2005, was expanded in 2019 to include
14 different associations. During the year many
initiatives were developed. These include:

* 10 Things to Know About the Payment Services
Directive 2, a leaflet in simple language and ina
format accessible to the blind and visually impaired,
illustrating the main innovations introduced by this
EU Directive

Letter to the Consumer, in collaboration with
Codacons, a summary of the most interesting topics
taken from the last UniCredit Integrated Report. The
letter was published on our website and a social
campaign was carried out on the UniCredit Twitter
account and on Codacons social media pages

Bella Nonno! An intergenerational training course
for active seniors carried out in collaboration with
Confconsumatori and aimed at citizens aged 65 and
over. It involved previously trained students aged 16
to 19 acting as tutors to promote the digitalisation
of young and senior citizens

Access to banking services in the Internal

Areas Project, carried out in collaboration with
Cittadinanzattiva to strengthen digitalisation, financial
awareness and entrepreneurship in remote internal
areas of the country. Facilitators, adequately trained
on banking and financial issues, represented the

point of reference for the inhabitants with regard to
these topics. In addition, we initiated the monitoring
of community needs: thanks to a survey on access

to banking services, the citizens of inland areas will

be able to design a map of their needs and propose
solutions that take the specific characteristics of the
territory to which they belong into account.

UniCredit supported these last two initiatives also
with the contribution of its Social Impact Banking
that produced the training contents and made the
skills of volunteer employees available.

Invest in social and
economic development

We strive to support the growth of our communities,
always in search of new ways to serve our retail and
corporate customers. In addition to our traditional
banking activities, we implement corporate
citizenship and philanthropic initiatives that support
financial and social inclusion.

In 2019 we contributed approximately €45 million’
to communities, as measured by the London
Benchmarking Group model (LBG). We also highlight
our investment in the Social Impact Banking project
as measured by the new LBG Business Innovation for
Social Impact reporting framework.
