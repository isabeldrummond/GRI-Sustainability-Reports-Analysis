participate in discussions regarding important business
topics and market trends, exchange ideas and network
with each other. This year’s event focused on innovation
and sustainability and the invitees were also given the
opportunity to hear more about the macroeconomic
situation of the CEE region and digital trends. More than
100 representatives of 22 different industries from 14
countries attended the event in 2019.

Through the dedicated platform UniCredit CEE
Lounge, in 2019 UniCredit, as an exclusive partner of
the London Stock Exchange Group’s ELITE initiative
in the CEE region, continued to provide support

to fast-growing SME customers to reshape their
companies, but also to better understand different
funding options and prepare them to communicate
with investors and to access a network of peers, as
well as advisors. This resulted in 14 new companies
from 5 countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania
and Serbia) joining Elite in 2019. Moreover, at the
beginning of 2020 other three companies from
Romania joined the project.

UniCredit concretely supports the internationalisation
and growth of companies that want to open up to foreign
markets with Easy Export, a high value-added service
that simplifies the procedures and processes involved

in business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce. Thanks to
UniCredit’s exclusive partnership with Alibaba.com, which
started in 2018 and was renewed in 20139, this service
offers access to the most important B2B market-place
worldwide and an enormous international shop window.
Easy Export is the solution that allows our clients to

open up to foreign markets worldwide with digital shop
windows that speak the local language and where
products are enhanced thanks to digital, personalised and
distinctive services.

When we identify business opportunities, we directly
support their financial viability and actively cooperate
with national, international and European institutions
to make sure SMEs receive the available public funds
earmarked for them. Our Group’s long-established
expertise in managing state and EU-supported
programmes benefits customers in a number of areas.
