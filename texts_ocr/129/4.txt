Transform 2019: a strategic
plan delivered as promised

Transform 2019 was about restructuring and reshaping the Group, with an emphasis on strengthening
capital and improving asset quality. We also strengthened our corporate governance in line with best-
in-class European companies. We are the only large listed Italian company where the board of directors
presents its own list of candidates. We also lifted voting restrictions and converted savings shares into
common shares.

Our hard work was acknowledged by the ECB that, at the end of 2019, lowered our SREP pillar 2
requirement by a further 25 basis points, to 175. This is 75 basis points lower than in 2016, an
achievement we are very proud of and another recognition of the outstanding work done by the team
over these last three years.

Team 23: a new strategic
plan, further building on our
pan European strengths

While Transform 2019 represented a strong cost efficiency and de-risking effort, Team 23 focuses
on strengthening and growing our customer base. All our key strategic initiatives focus on customer
experience, which we will monitor precisely while making sure we increase our process optimisation.
We will also continue to manage the business with tight cost discipline, focusing on high asset
quality and ensuring we maintain a very strong capital level at all times. We work on this from a
position of strength, thanks to Transform 2019. We will deliver a recurring dividend with a mix of
cash and share buybacks.
