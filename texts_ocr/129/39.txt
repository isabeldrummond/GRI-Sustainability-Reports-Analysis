Our Strategy
~ Social and relationship Capital

In 2019 we continued to engage in a range of
financial education programmes, targeting several
demographics. Our training programmes include
face-to-face and digital sessions.

FOCUS

Banking Academy

In Italy we developed our new Banking Academy, with
free financial education programmes and training on
digitalisation and innovation. Our offer targets young
people, families, elderly, entrepreneurs and non-profit
organisations.

For individuals and SMEs, our /n-Formati programme
involved roughly 6,900 participants in 200 training
sessions on banking and on entrepreneurship, while
our Save4You lessons gave over 5,200 participants
the opportunity to focus on savings and investments.

In 2019 more than 2,500 companies participated in
the three UniCredit Talk, discussions and networking
events for experts, banks and entrepreneurs, about the
new challenges linked to the digital revolution and their
impact on organisational and business models with a
specific focus on export, welfare and the digitalisation
of SMEs.

In the last Talk, a new project called PMI Digital Lab
was started in which Banking Academy, together
with other important national partners, participated
with the aim of investing in the growth of SME
digital skills. In 2019 seven of the 10 planned stages
were implemented, involving more than 200 SMEs
throughout Italy.

With Go International! we offered seminars for
entrepreneurs and export managers, focusing on topics
such as export management, new technologies and
digitalisation. In 2019 this programme, through the
Digital&Export Business School initiative, involved 34
locations throughout Italy and connected approximately
500 companies interested in opening or strengthening
their presence on foreign markets.

In Germany we provide financial knowledge and
quality information on key topics and latest trends
in financial services, markets and business concepts
through channels such as dossiers.hypovereinsbank.
de and hypovereinsbank-publikationen.de. We
continued to support young start-ups and founders
with a number of different intense training
programmes thanks to our BayStartUp, Bavaria’s
leading network for start-up formation, coaching,
financing and acceleration, initiated and supported by
the Bavarian Ministry of Economics. All together 78
workshops were supported.

In Austria we were the title sponsor of the Bank Austria
Business Plan Contest Next Generation and the Bank
Austria Business Idea Contest. Approximately 1,500
pupils (school classes, groups or young individuals)
were able to enter the contest in one of the following
categories: best business idea, best business plan and
most sustainable business idea.

Encouraging social inclusion

In 2019, we continued to work on improving the
social welfare and well-being of our communities.
Our efforts included the promotion of fundraising
activities and culture in all its forms.

Gift Matching Programme

This is our main employee community involvement
activity. In 2019 the 17" edition was aimed at
supporting non-profit organisations engaged in
activities for children and adolescents up to their 18"
birthday. In addition to doubling employee donations,
UniCredit Foundation assigned a bonus to donations
made by donors under 35 and by volunteers of the
organisation they supported.

The programme collected in total more than €820,000.

UniCredit Card E

The Call for the Regions - Carta E 2019 was promoted
by UniCredit Foundation and focuses on supporting
child and adolescent projects with a significant social
impact.

The winning projects included initiatives for the
humanisation of pediatric wards, support for disabled
children and children in vulnerable situations and

the promotion of a more conscious use of new
technologies.

This call was made possible thanks to UniCredit

Card E, the credit card where we donate part of our
commission to the social initiatives we support on

a national level. Since 2018 we have extended this
mechanism to all our employees’ credit cards in Italy.
Over €2.5 million were collected during 2019.

Our Strategy
~ Social and relationship Capital

Supporting competitiveness and ee
contributing to community growth

An ongoing interaction is necessary if we are to ©
understand the urgent needs of communities and

meet them with appropriate initiatives. This kind of
interaction enables us at UniCredit to develop products

and services that serve stakeholders and encourage

a balanced and collaborative approach to well-being,

prosperity and growth. Our Group remains focused

on understanding the daily needs of stakeholders and

meeting them effectively, at the same time helping to

solve urgent national challenges.

In Italy, as partners in the Italian Alliance for
Sustainable Development (Alleanza Italiana per lo
Sviluppo Sostenibile or ASviS), we contributed to
organising their 2019 Sustainable Development
Festival to draw attention to the SDGs and help raise
awareness on the United Nations’ 2030 agenda.

Our networking initiative Territorial Advisory Boards
provides advice for UniCredit’s seven regions in Italy.
Appointed by the UniCredit Board of Directors, these
boards provide feedback to our senior management,
assisting them in defining the business strategies
and development plans in their respective regions
and strengthening UniCredit’s local reputation.
Furthermore, the Boards select and design priorities
and projects to be discussed during the Forum dei
Territori, meetings between our senior managers
and main local stakeholders. Approximately 1,300
participants were welcomed during the seven events
held in our regions in 2019.

Moreover, we organized a series of conferences to
provide issuers with the opportunity to meet institutional
investors from all over the world: the /talian Investment
and High Yield Conference, the Italian Financial Debt
Conference and the Convertible Bond Conference.

involved

investors participating.

financial outlook, cash management trends and ESG
loan initiatives with more than 900 participants.
