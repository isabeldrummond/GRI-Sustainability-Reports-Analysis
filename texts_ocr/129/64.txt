> Governance

UniCredit’s culture permeates both its operations and the way business is conducted, ensuring proper addressing,
coordination and control of Group activities and the management of related risks. This culture is grounded in a
reliable system of values and rules, represented by:

Ethics and Respect, these values unite us and define our Group culture: how we make decisions and how we act
on them. Together, they are an evolution of our Integrity Charter. Do the right thing! is the guiding principle which
help us live these values?

« the Code of Conduct, which aims to promote a culture of Compliance by providing an outline of the Compliance
rules, the ethical professional standards and commitment to sustainability

+ the Code of Ethics, adopted pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01 for the Holding Company, its foreign
branches and Italian subsidiaries. It contains the rules for all employees to ensure that conduct is always guided
by criteria of fairness, collaboration, loyalty, transparency and mutual respect, as well as to avoid conduct that

Governance structures

UniCredit has adopted the so-called traditional management and control system based on the existence of two
corporate bodies whose members are appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting: the Board of Directors, in charge of
the strategic supervision and the management of the company, and the Board of Statutory Auditors, responsible
for supervising management. Legal accounting supervision is entrusted by the Shareholders’ Meeting to an external
audit firm, upon proposal by the Board of Statutory Auditors, in compliance with relevant current laws.

This traditional management system, envisaging specific obligations for the Shareholders’ Meeting, allows for the
clear exchange of views between management and shareholders on fundamental elements of governance. These
elements include appointing and removing Directors, appointing members to the Board of Statutory Auditors,
granting a mandate for the external auditing to an audit firm, approving all connected fees. They also encompass:
the approval of financial statements, the allocation of profits, the resolutions on remuneration and incentive
policies and practices, in accordance with current provisions, as well as the criteria to determine the compensation
to be granted in the event of early termination of employment or early retirement from office.

The Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors members are appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting on
the basis of a proportional representation mechanism (voto di lista). This voting system features lists of competing

candidates to ensure the election of minority shareholders representatives.

The structure of the above-mentioned corporate bodies guarantees they are gender-balanced in compliance with
current regulations and provisions.
