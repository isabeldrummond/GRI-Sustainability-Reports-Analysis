As for the previous plan, the Team 23 KPIs cover
profitability, asset quality and cost. In our LTIP we have
for the first time introduced sustainability KPIs into the
scorecard to reflect our firm commitment to ESG topics,
the renewed focus on improved customer experience and
our dedication to the team.

We are acting to ensure the sustainability of
our revenues, therefore financial capital, in the
long-term and help protect all our capitals,
from natural and from social and relationship to
intellectual and human capital.
