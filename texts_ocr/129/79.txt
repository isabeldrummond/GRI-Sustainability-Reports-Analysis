Welfare and work-life balance?

Since 2018 UniCredit has adopted a global framework for its welfare strategy based on the Human Capital mission
to create the best place to work. The aim is to attract, retain and engage employees, offering adequate welfare
standards in all geographies.

Welfare initiatives are developed locally in order to offer the right answer to a country’s needs and special
requirements, with a central coordination to guarantee respect of the Group welfare principles and guidelines.

In the majority of countries across the Group, we have already established several tailor-made initiatives to meet
fundamental health and family needs. In 2019, we took further concrete actions by implementing new initiatives
with a particular focus on respect for time off and wellbeing.

Social dialogue creates a balance between workers’ needs and business needs by constantly verifying the continuity
of initiatives and progress of projects over time.

UniCredit intends to continuously enhance its current practices while fully respecting the specific requirements of
individual countries. The innovative approach defined by the Joint Declaration on Work-Life Balance in 2017 aims
to inspire and promote local initiatives by identifying specific macro-areas of focus and promoting a set of concrete
actions and clear drivers.

In Italy a best practice is represented by the Conto Welfare initiative. Since 2012, thanks to favourable fiscal
provisions our employees have been offered the opportunity to use a portion of their variable compensation to
cover certain personal and family needs in a tax efficient way. Initially, only education, health and pension fund
needs were taken into account whilst the range of services has been extended over the years, in line with the Group
welfare strategy, to meet our employees’ needs with regard to flexibility, well-being and the work-life balance.
Today 80% of our colleagues use their Conto Welfare to cover services ranging from nursery and school fees or care
for elderly and disabled family members to health, public transport, travel, sport and culture.

A. The reported contribution percentages refer to the second section of the Fondo Pensione per il Personale delle Aziende del Gruppo UniCredit, the pension fund

currently open to new participants.

B. A further contribution of 2 percent for newly recruited staff (art. 46, paragraph 3 - National Collective Bargaining Agreement of ABI, March 3, 2015) is added to
this assumption for 4 consecutive years; consequently, the contribution from the employer amounts to 4 percent for this category.
