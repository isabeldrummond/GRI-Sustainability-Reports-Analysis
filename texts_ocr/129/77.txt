Industrial Relations?

At UniCredit, we strongly believe in the importance of social dialogue, in particular with regard to the Group’s

labour practices. Social dialogue enhances our ability to cooperate, improves our listening skills and expands our

understanding of domestic and global labour needs. A consistent, Groupwide approach has allowed us to build a high

standard of social dialogue over the years, helping us to manage the challenging goals of our business strategies.

In 2019 our social dialogue went one step further by signing the Global Framework Agreement (GFA) on Human

Rights and Fundamental Labour Rights with UNI Global Finance, the global trade union for the banking and

insurance sectors. The GFA is aimed at strengthening dialogue with trade unions regarding human rights and

fundamental labour rights, in particular the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. In so

doing, we specifically engaged on:

protecting human rights

* combatting sexual misconduct, harassment and bullying, including the ongoing commitment to adopt the
necessary measures to combat the risk of sexual harassment and acts of retaliation in the workplace

* combatting discrimination and promoting diversity and inclusion irrespective of sex, age, ethnic origin, ability or
sexual orientation

* promoting positive working conditions and work-life balance.

In every country where we operate, we remain committed to improving UniCredit’s social dialogue, focusing on
building on our strong European identity. At national level, workers’ interests are represented in our Group by trade
unions, works councils or other representatives in line with applicable labour laws and local industrial relations
systems. At international level, workers are represented by the European Works Council (EWC) which, since its
foundation in 2007, has worked to ensure the right to information and consultation on transnational Group topics
that could significantly affect workers’ interests. In 2019 the EWC founding agreement was renewed, providing a
valid and updated high-level social dialogue framework, capable of addressing the social partners to set up spaces
for an effective, enriched and wider debate. The EWC currently has 30 members representing 15 countries (Austria,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Russia,
Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and United Kingdom).

Over the past ten years, UniCredit and the EWC have achieved important results, defining a distinctive global
approach to industrial relations. The four joint declarations signed over the last decade demonstrate their success
in improving social dialogue across Europe by establishing a global strategic overview that facilitates social
dialogue at local level.

The Joint Declaration on Training, Learning and Professional Development (December 2008) is based on the
principle that learning is a lifelong, continuous and effective experience. It defines guidelines and principles that,
respecting the different cultural, social and historical backgrounds of each country where UniCredit is present,
should support all actors involved and serve as a point of reference for all strategies, activities and initiatives in the
fields of training, learning and professional development.

The Joint Declaration on Equal Opportunities and Non-Discrimination (May 2009) is intended to be a point of
reference for all employees to define the guidelines on sensitive issues such as diversity, equal opportunities and
non-discrimination, with the purpose of creating a diverse corporate culture, strengthening a sense of belonging
and enhancing quality of life at work.
