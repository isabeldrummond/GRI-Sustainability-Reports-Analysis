The company pursues a targeted geographical diversification and product strategy accompanied by greater
integration of its business activities.

This international growth strategy has been driven by the acquisitions made over the years, including that of
Compagnie des Ciments Belges (CCB) in 2016, which strengthened Cementir’s production and commercial
presence in Central Europe, and of Sacci’s Italian business in July 2016. In September 2017, an agreement
was reached for the sale of all the Italian operations of the Cementir Italia group, finalised on 2 January 2018.
In March 2018, Cementir finalised the acquisition of a further 38.75% share in Lehigh White Cement Company
from Lehigh Cement Company LLC, a subsidiary of HeidelbergCement AG. Through that transaction, the
Cementir group controlled LWCC with a 63.25% share as of 31 December 2018, while the remaining 36.75%
was held by the Cemex group. The acquisition enabled it to become involved in the direct management of
assets in the US, in the white cement segment, the Group's core business, enhancing its global leadership in
line with the growth strategy.

The Group's operations are organized on a regional basis in seven geographical areas: Nordic & Baltic,
Belgium, North America, Turkey, Egypt, Asia Pacific and Italy.
