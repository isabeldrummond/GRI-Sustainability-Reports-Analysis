CLIMATE CHANGE TARGETS

Together with the strategy in 2019 the Group has also defined targets, differentiated between grey and white
cement, which have as their final aim the reduction of COz emissions and the mitigation of climate change.
The Group decided to reduce COz emissions per ton of cement of about 30% by 2030. The target, which
differentiates between grey cement (31% by 2030] and white cement (35% by 2030] will be achieved through
greater use of alternative fuels and renewable resources, and reduction of thermal consumption and clinker
ratio of cements. Specific targets for alternative fuels, clinker ratio and CO2 emissions have been established
in order to accomplish the 2030 goals.

The climate change targets established by the Group have been deployed in each single plant and per year

and were included in the Industrial Plan 2020-2022 approved by the Board of Directors of Cementir Holding.

INCENTIVES PROVIDED FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CLIMATE-
RELATED ISSUES

The monetary incentive plan adopted by Cementir is based on a short-term incentive (STI) system. The system
maintains the proper ratio between its components and adequate incentives to achieve continuously improving
performance levels within the sustainable value creation structure. The STI is based on the Group’s and/or
subsidiaries’ financial targets and includes objectives based on indicators linked to company performance and
to managerial roles actually held within the Company.

The STI is a tool with which Cementir promotes also the fulfilment of various climate change-related objectives
(especially CO2 emissions, alternative fuels and alternative raw materials). Managers from all organisational
levels participate and share in this incentive system, so that fulfilling defined goals results in the receipt of

annual monetary incentives.
