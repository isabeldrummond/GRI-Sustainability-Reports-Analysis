PRODUCTION OF READY-MIXED CONCRETE

In 2019, Cementir Holding produced and distributed 4.1 million cubic metres of ready-mixed concrete of
all types and classes. Ready-mixed concrete is used widely in constructions and comes from a mixture of
cement and aggregates like sand and gravel, water and any additives. The aggregates serve as bulk, while
the cement, reacting chemically with water, serves to bond the other elements. In some cases, admixtures
of various kinds diluted in water are added to obtain specific results or performances, for example greater
fluidity or rapid setting.

Ready-mixed concrete is made and pre-packed in plants known as concrete mixing plants where the mixture
is dosed in special equipment. The mixing stage may take place directly at the plant (thanks to premixers) or
during transport by special vehicles {mixer trucks) that continuously mix the product so that it maintains its
fluidity, which is essential for building work. When the ready-mixed concrete reaches the building site it is
ready for use, i.e. the “pouring” phase. Often, before being “poured”, the ready-mixed concrete is subjected to
a special process known as “pumping”. This consists of a second transport phase through piping, which makes

it much easier to reach particular heights to form floor slabs, tunnels, etc.

AGGREGATES AND CEMENT PRODUCTS

Cementir Holding produces concrete products
at Vianini Pipe Inc plants in the USA, Portugal
(JV with Secil) and in Poland. These pre-
stressed cement products consist of structural
components for the building and transport
industries, and include pipelines, jack pipes,
blocks, tiles, railway sleepers, etc., obtained
using mechanical and hydraulic technologies
with cement as a raw material.
In Belgium and Scandinavia, Cementir Holding
is also active in the production and distribution
to third parties of aggregates. Aggregates are
rocky materials such as gravel, sand and crushed
stone extracted from quarries and from the shores of
rivers which are crushed and then used with hydraulic binders such as cement and lime in order to create
concrete, mortar and other types of plaster. In many cases they are also used as structural elements in

construction work.

PURSUING INNOVATION

Continuous process and product innovation are at the heart of the Group strategy. Cementir’s goal is to develop
high added value solutions in close collaboration with customers, consultants and partners.

Innovation is in our DNA. Since the beginning, we have been producing special cement. Then we have
established ourselves as world leaders in segments such as white cement and high value-added products
with. We consider research and development a strategic and essential tool to improve both product quality
and sustainability.

For us, innovation means continuously broadening our horizon by listening to the market and our customers’
needs. This approach leads us to develop new products and solutions capable of improving existing

performance and promoting a circular economy.
