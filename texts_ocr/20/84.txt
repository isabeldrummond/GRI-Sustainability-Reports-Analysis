LOOKING AT THE VALUE CREATED

ECONOMIC VALUE GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED”

Cementir Holding redistributed part of the wealth generated to its shareholders and stakeholders, including
employees, suppliers, government and local communities.

The representation of this wealth is calculated through economic value generated and distributed, which takes
into account the key factors for assessing the social role of a business in the area where it operates and for
the people that are involved in its production processes.

For example, this calculation includes staff remuneration and costs; taxes paid in countries where the company
operates (production excises, VAT, direct taxation] or payments to suppliers.

The analysis of the value-added distribution is based on economic value generated, distributed and retained
by the company, calculated by restating the items on the income statement of the Cementir Group's
consolidated financial statements. This analysis produces a quantitative assessment of direct socio-economic

impact, by looking at the various items that comprise the wealth created and distributed in the form of costs.

effect, linked mainly to taxes.
