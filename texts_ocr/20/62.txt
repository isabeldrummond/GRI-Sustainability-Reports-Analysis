Cementir is a member of the Global Cement and Concrete innovation and

Association (GCCA), with the aim of fostering innovation and collaboration with
collaboration with industry associations and inspiring architects, . oo.
engineers and innovators across the globe and along the length industry associations

of the built environment value chain. Through the GCCA, in 2019,

Cementir joined Innovandi, a network connecting cement industry and scientific institutions to drive new ways of
working and innovations.

In 2019, the Group became member of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in order to improve the Group's
accountability for climate change and joined the ACT Project.

The ACT - Assessing low Carbon Transition initiative, co-founded by the French Energy and Environmental Agency
(ADEME) and the CDP. is an accountability framework and provides methodologies to assess how companies strategies
and actions are contributing to the Paris Agreement mitigation goals of remaining considerably below a 2°C temperature
increase above pre-industrial levels. The objective of the project is to develop an assessment methodology for the
cement sector to drive companies to act and lead them on a relevant low-carbon pathway in terms of their climate
strategy, business model, product and services, investments, operations, GHG emissions and GHG management.
Cementir is also member of the European Cement Research Academy (ECRA). ECRA‘s most important research
projects are related to the carbon capture and storage {CCS} technology.

Through the CEMBUREAU (European Cement Association), Cementir is directly involved in dedicated working
groups that are coming up with proposals for revising the EU Emissions Trading System and sustainable
construction legislation.

In 2019, through Aalborg Portland, the Group was involved in the most ambitious CO2z reduction project sponsored
by a national government. In autumn 2019 the Danish government made a broad political agreement with the main
political parties to define a binding climate law with the target of reducing Danish COQ2 emissions by 70% by 2030,
from a 1990 baseline.

In December 2019, the Danish Prime Minister appointed the Managing Director of Aalborg Portland as head of
the climate partnership for energy-intensive industry in Denmark. This climate partnership, led by Aalborg
Portland and composed by the main refining, chemicals and food Danish companies, will provide the Danish
government with the technical forecast of all potential COz reduction achievable and will define the prerequisites

(policy, research, innovation, subsidies, etc.] for such reductions.
