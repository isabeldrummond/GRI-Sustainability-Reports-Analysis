in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised and, therefore, do not provide us with a sufficient level of

interviews, primarily of company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information

1. analysis, through inquiries, of the governance system and the process for managing the
sustainability issues relating to the Group's strategy and operations;

Group, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process used, in accordance with the
reporting standards adopted;

3. analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area;
