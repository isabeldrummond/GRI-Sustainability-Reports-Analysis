Respecting human rights is a shared responsibility within the company, deriving from the obligation to comply
with our Code of Ethics and the other policies with an impact on human rights issues. In 2019, we launched a
Human Rights project, with the goal of identifying a comprehensive system for monitoring and prevention of

the areas of greatest risk.
We have the utmost commitment towards the communities in which we operate.

We feel the responsibility to help in times of need, as we did, at the beginning of 2020, after the earthquake

that struck Elazig, in Turkey, or in China during the coronavirus outbreak.

In Elazig we provided support and assistance to the victims of the disaster. In the following hours after the
earthquake, we made donation to the local authorities and we opened the plant to provide accommodation to
the families that lost their houses. In China our plant has been temporary closed and a donation has been
made to the local authorities that are facing this public health emergency. The health and well-being of our
employees and partners are our priority, for this reason we will gradually restart the operations in close

consultation with our suppliers and public health experts.

n Turkey, the Cementir Group maintains close ties with the most vulnerable groups through the Cimentas
Education and Health Foundation, established in 1986 and committed to provide financial assistance and
educational materials to families and schools. In 1998, the Foundation established the Isikkent High School.
his upper school is recognized for its innovative approach to education and research and in 2019 counted
770 students.

n Belgium we participate in the Life in Quarries initiative, a project founded by the European Commission to

develop biodiversity and the rehabilitation of closed quarries.
uch has been done, but even more is left to do. Cement sector has to handle important challenges through
the next years and we have the responsibility to lead the change with our competitive and innovative approach

and energy.

cordially invite you to comment and inspire us in order to continuously improve the sustainability of our

 

usiness and contribute to the construction of a better Future.
