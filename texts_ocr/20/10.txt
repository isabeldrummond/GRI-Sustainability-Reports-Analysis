 

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019

THE DEFINITION OF THE MATERIAL ISSUES

For Cementir Group, the relevant issues for the company and its stakeholders are those that have an impact,

directly or in

irectly, on Cementir’s ability to create, preserve or that adversely affect the Group's value.

The materiality analysis performed by the Group three years ago was part of a broader assessment of the

sustainability

erformnance of Cementir, through which useful elements were collected that helped in setting the

groundwork for the Group sustainability strategy defined in 2019. The initial analysis saw the involvement of the

management

both of Cementir Holding and of the Group’s various Regions and identified the priority aspects for

the company and for its stakeholders. The 2018 topics, in line with those defined three years ago, were evaluated

in the previous reporting year in order to assess their continued relevance. The review consisted of a benchmark

with a panel o

companies operating in the sector and a survey on the context and the challenges the sector has

to deal with. The results of this work confirmed that the material topics maintained their relevance in 2018.

In 2019 therefore, from this starting point, and following the definition of the sustainability strategy and targets,

the Group performed a slight review of the topics and their importance. The review was performed at a desk

level, assessing the requirements of the top management, as witnessed by the sustainability strategy. Based on

this, the materiality matrix was defined. The results were then reviewed and validated by the top management.

Below, the 20

business and

9 materiality matrix is presented. The matrix illustrates the most relevant topics both for the

or its stakeholders, as presented in the upper-right-hand corner of the graph. All the material

topics are important in the organisation, except for the subject of health and safety which also has an impact on

 

third parties operating in Group plants.
