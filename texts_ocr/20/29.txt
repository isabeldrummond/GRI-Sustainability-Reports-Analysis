From the clinker production process, there are two big
differences between white and grey cement:
1. The quality control of the colour. A reflection of at least 86% is generally required for the white cement to be
competitive. The reflection of grey cement is in the range of 30-40%, a fairly dark
colour being preferred. The demand for consistency of colour of white cement is
much higher than for grey as no nuances of white or mottling can be accepted.
2. The production process, including the use of consistent raw materials
selected within a narrow range of chemical compositions.
These peculiarities of white clinker production compared to grey leads to a need
for higher energy consumption in the clinker burning process. This is caused
by three main reasons:
e The raw mix, with low iron content and high silicate content, is hard to burn.
The reason for this is the relatively small amount of liquid produced during
sintering, because of the low iron content of the mix. The final reaction in

the kiln, conversion of belite to alite, requires the melt liquid as a solvent,

 

and is slower if the amount of melt is low;
e The reduced burning conditions increase the energy demand of the process;
e The quenching process, necessary to maintain the white colour, contributes to the relatively poor energy
efficiency of the process, since the sensible heat of the clinker is not recycled as in normal clinker manufacture.
Our plants constantly strive to reduce energy consumption. At the Aalborg plant, the white cement kilns are

fitted with heat recovery units, which supply district heating to the city of Aalborg.

ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY WHITE CEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION

The use of white cement in construction offers multiple advantages.

Energy saving and better thermal comfort of dwellings: reflection of sunlight reduces heat absorption and
improves thermal comfort. This allows savings in lighting and air conditioning of the rooms.

Light-coloured surfaces reflect sunlight much more effectively than dark. Providing more reflective surfaces
such as light-coloured roofs, walls and pavements will therefore result in more energy reflected to space,
resulting in less warming.

Locally, this effect is especially significant in cities which tend to become unbearably hot during summertime.
Substituting dark roofs, walls and pavements by white significantly reduces this “heat island effect”.
Optimization of construction and maintenance costs: white cement allows to obtain coloured cement products,
reducing construction costs and subsequent maintenance costs.

Greater road safety: white concrete road barriers increase visibility and improve safety because they keep a
