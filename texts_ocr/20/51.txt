In the last year, the replacement rate of fossil fuels has continued growing in line with previous years. Almost
23.5% of the thermal energy needed in the cement production process is generated from alternative fuels.
The goal is to reach 77% from alternative fuels in grey cement production and 6% in white cement
production by 20304.

Consumption of fossil fuel is mainly linked to prices in accordance with market conditions. The significant
increase in the use of alternative fuel confirms the Group’s commitment to the use of those resources

compared to traditional energy production sources.

“The quality requirements of white cement production make it difficult to use alternative fuels, as they affect the colour of the cement.
For this reason their use is drastically limited
