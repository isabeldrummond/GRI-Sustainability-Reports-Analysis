DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GREY AND WHITE CEMENT

White and grey cement are two distinctly different products, with different applications and production methods.
Applications of white cement are different from the uses of grey cement. White cement is mainly used for dry-
mix products, mortars, special products and decorative purposes. Main uses for grey cement are in heavy
construction, such as in-situ or precast concrete. Grey cement is a commodity product, used for mass
construction, such as civil works, dwellings and industrial estates.

From a commercial point of view, there is a clear distinction between grey and white cement. In contrast to grey

cement, white cement is a specialty product,

  

with niche applications and markets,

which are clearly differentiated from

grey cement applications.

White cement is differentiated from

grey in term of:

1.White colour and capacity for
being combined with different
pigments in order to produce
uniformly coloured products.

2. Consistent product quality low
variation, high strength and low
content of minor elements make
white cement a preferred
component of dry mix construction
formulations.

White cement is used for specialty applications, where chemical purity, compatibility with other components,

high strength or certain aesthetic impressions is desired. This is exemplified by a number of specific

applications of white cement:

e White and coloured mortars. Cement-based plasters and mortars are used for facades panels, swimming
pools, and in general to avoid painting. Because of its high durability, much less maintenance is needed than
for painted surfaces. Without white cement it would be impossible to produce these products which need a
homogeneous and reactive base product for their preparation. Only white cement satisfies these requirements.
e Renders, joint fillers, tile adhesives. White cement is often used as main binding component in the
formulation of construction materials such as joint fillers, ceramic tile adhesives, insulation and anchorage
mortars, industrial floor mortars, ready mixed plaster, repair mortars and water-tight coatings for e.g.
bathrooms. These products have complex formulations of up to 10 or more ingredients. The regularity

and chemical purity of white cement is critical to these applications.
e Exterior facade panels or decorative coating stones. White cement is also used in products such as
floor tiles, kerbstones, prefabricated stairs and balconies, window sills and street furniture.
Additionally, applications such as white briquette and white press brick,
a concrete grids and pool edges are also included in the areas of use. Similar
products cannot be made in any practical and durable manner by painting grey

concrete materials.

e Works of art and street furniture. White cement is used in concrete sculptures,
monuments and the restoration of archaeological sites. This is due to the ability
of white concrete to be cast in any shape [plastic capability]. It is also used for
the construction of street furniture, as it is more durable than steel and can be

made in different colours.
