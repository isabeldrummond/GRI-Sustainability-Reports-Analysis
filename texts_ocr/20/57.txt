WASTE PRODUCED

The cement production process does not in itself generate waste; the quantities of waste produced in the
plants can be attributed to secondary activities, such as maintenance, warehouse and office activities, which
generate waste in the same way as any production plant. Management of waste produced in Cementir Group
plants is governed by the regulations in force in the countries where the Group operates, favouring the reuse

and recovery of materials.
