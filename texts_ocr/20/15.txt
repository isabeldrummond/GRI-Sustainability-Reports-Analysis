rei Lowering clinker
a content of white

&> cement to 80%

The demands for consistency of color
of white cement is much higher than
for grey as no nuances of white or
colored surfaces can be accepted.
Alternative minerals affect the color
and for this reason their utilization is
drastically limited for white cement

In 2019, the clinker /
cement ratio for white
cement was 84%

In the Danish city of Aalborg, our
production plant recovers energy to
provide district heating to over 36,000
dwellings, which will become 50,000 in
the near future, covering about the half
of its urban population

Cementir has defined that all operating
companies in the cement production,
concrete production and waste
Management sectors have to operate
with a certified environmental
management system (i.e. ISO 14001).
As of 2019, 67% of all operating
companies are certified |SO 14001, in
2025 the percentage will be 86% while
in 2030 all operating companies will be
certified

In 2019, the Aalborg
Plant provided 1,6
million Gigajoules of
thermal energy to the
local community

In 2019, 67% of
operating companies
