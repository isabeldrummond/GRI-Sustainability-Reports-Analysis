GLOSSARY

Cement equivalent (TCE - Total Cement Equivalent): an indicator related to the plant's production of clinker,
calculated based on the produced clinker and on the average clinker/cement ratio for the year.

COz: Carbon dioxide is an oxide acid [anhydride] formed by a carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms. It is
an essential substance in the vital processes of plants and animals, but itis also responsible for the rise in
global warming.

g/tTCE: grams per ton of cement equivalent.

Joule: unit of measure of energy [one joule is the work required to exert a force of one newton for a distance
of one meter). A gigajoule (Gj) is equal to 1*109 joules, while a terajoule (TJ) is equal to 1*1012 joules.
Frequency rate: the index used to calculate the scale of accidents. It is the number of accidents that have
occurred in a year divided by the hours worked in the same year. The rate is multiplied by 200,000, a factor
enabling presentation of the number of work accidents every 100 full time workers, working over one year
{with the assumption that a full-time worker works about 2,000 hours per year).

Severity rate: the rate used to calculate the extent of injury [i.e. the severity of the consequences of accidents
at work]. This is the number of days of work lost due to accidents divided by the number of hours worked in
the same year. The rate is multiplied by 200,000, a factor enabling presentation of the severity of the number
of work accidents every 100 full time workers, working over one year (with the assumption that a full-time
worker works about 2,000 hours).

Accident®: an accidental event that occurs during work and that has caused a temporary and/or permanent
physical or psychological injury or the death of the worker.

RDF (Refuse-Derived Fuel): translation of the English acronym RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) a solid dry shredded
fuel obtained by processing solid urban waste, generally collected in cylindrical blocks known as eco-bales.
SRF (Solid Recovered Fuel): translation of the English acronym SRF (Solid Recovered Fuel) a solid dry
shredded fuel obtained by processing solid urban waste compliant with European standard ER15359.

ISO 14001: a voluntary international standard, establishing the requirements that an efficient environmental
management system must fulfil. ISO 14001 is a certifiable standard, meaning that certification of compliance
with its requirements may be obtained from an accredited certification agency operating within given rules.
ISO 14001 certification is not mandatory but is the result of a voluntary choice by a company/organization that
decides to establish/implement/maintain/improve its environmental management system. Adopting the ISO
14001 standard it allows an organization to identify and monitor the impact of its activities on the environment
and improve its environmental performance by implementing a systematic approach that involves the definition
and the achievement of specific environmental goals.

OHSAS 18001: the international standard that sets the requirements for developing a system for managing and
protecting the health and safety of workers (OHSAS stands for Occupational Health and Safety Assessment
Series}. OHSAS certification verifies the voluntary application within an organization of a system that guarantees
sufficient control of occupational health and safety, as well as compliance with mandatory regulations.

1SO 45001: is an ISO standard for management systems of occupational health and safety (OH&S), published
in March 2018. It includes elements that are additional to BS OHSAS 18001 which it is replacing over a three-
year migration period from 2018 to 2021.

ISO 50001: a voluntary international standard that specifies the requirements for creating, implementing,
maintaining and improving an energy management system. The aim of this system is to make it possible for
an organization to use a systematic approach to continuously improve its energy performance, including energy

efficiency as well as energy consumption and use.
