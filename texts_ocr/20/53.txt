ALTERNATIVE RAW MATERIALS

Cement production requires large quantities of natural raw materials, The Cementir Group
such as limestone, clay and gypsum, extracted from natural quarries . .
using various methods. These are initially mixed to produce the meal IS particularly focused
from which the clinker is made, and subsequently added to the clinker on the environmental
and milled to obtain different types of cement. The Cementir Group is aspects associated with
particularly focused on the environmental aspects associated with its . . .
operations with the aim of limiting their impact on ecosystems and on its operations with the

the areas concerned. In this sense, it continues its commitment to aim of limiting their

reduce the use of non-renewable raw materials, promoting the use of impact on ecosystems and

alternative raw materials, so called because they do not originate from h d
quarries but from other production processes. The Group has set the on the areas concerne

target for lowering its clinker/cement ratio to 69% for grey cement
and 80% for white cement. This objective is also attained by
substituting clinker with alternative raw materials.

In 2019 the cement production plants of the Cementir Group used a total of about 15 million tons of materials
to produce cement, slightly less compared to the previous year (in the last three reporting years there has been
a decrease in raw materials used of 6.8%]. That decrease is partly linked to the drop in the total production of
cement recorded in 2019. During the year, almost 12% of raw materials used were recycled, including fly ash,

blast-furnace slag and other sub-products deriving from the quarrying activities at the CCB plant in Belgium.
