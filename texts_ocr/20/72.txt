CEMENTIR ACADEMY

The Cementir Academy continued its extended mission to support Cementir strategy and business results, to

develop current and future global leaders, to accelerate the Group transformation and to foster diversity and

inclusion across the Group. We designed and delivered key training and development initiatives which include:
the completion of the first edition of the Lead Programme for Group senior leaders;

ethe implementation of the 2-year Group Technical Training Programme at
Aalborg consisting of several online preliminary training courses, on site courses,
plant visits and external open classrooms;

the launch of some additional new online courses to our Academy catalogue (i.e.
Handling procedure for the management of privileged information; Cybersecurity);

ethe transposition and deployment of the existing online courses in local
languages [i.e. Danish, Norwegian);

the deployment of “EvOCEM” (Evolved Office for Cementir] training to all eligible
Group population by relying on about 20 Group ambassadors;

the deployment of functional and technical training to upskill professional Group

families and sub-communities.

Employee development is also supported through internal and external local training
courses, accompanied by a series of other initiatives such as participation in work projects involving multiple
departments and, in some cases, work experience abroad.

More than 50.000 hours of training were supplied in 2019, almost 17 hours per capita. The measures put in
place involved the entire Group population in a cross-functional and balanced way covering various roles, as

can be seen from the summary table of training hours by professional category.
