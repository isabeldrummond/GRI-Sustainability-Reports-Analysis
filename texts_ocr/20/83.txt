EARNINGS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS”

In 2019, cement and clinker volumes reached 9.5 million tons, down by 3.4%. On a like-for-like basis, cement
and clinker volumes were down 5% due to the negative performance in Turkey which was partially offset by
the good performance in Belgium and Denmark.

Ready-mixed concrete volumes reached 4.1 million cubic metres, down 16.4% due to the drop in Turkey.
Aggregates volumes reached 9.7 million tons, down by 2.4% after the excellent result in 2018.

Group revenues reached EUR 1,211.8 million, up 1.3% compared to EUR 1,196.2 million in 2018. The increase
was due to the line-by-line consolidation of the US company Lehigh White Cement Company {LWCC] from 1
April 2018, which brought an increase in revenue of EUR 33.0 million.

On a like-for-like basis, revenue fell 1.4% due to the significant drop in revenue in Turkey, which was largely
offset by the performance in other regions.

At constant 2018 exchange rates, revenue would have reached EUR 1,219.7 million, up 2% on the previous year.
EBITDA reached EUR 263.8 million, up 10.6% on EUR 238.5 million in 2018. The change in EBITDA was driven by
the introduction of IFRS 16, which had a positive impact of EUR 25.5 million, as well as the additional EUR 3.7
million contribution from LWCC. However, EBITDA was pulled down by the EUR 25.5 million drop in Turkey. At
constant exchange rates with the previous year, EBITDA would have remained unchanged at EUR 263.8 million.
EBITDA also benefited from a non-recurring income (EUR 6.4 million compared to EUR 11.5 million in 2018)
due to the revaluation of land and buildings in Turkey.

The EBITDA margin was 21.8%, improving the incidence on revenue by 1.8% on 2018.

Considering EUR 112.0 million of amortisation, depreciation, write-downs and provisions [EUR 85.3 million in 2018),
EBIT reached EUR 151.7 million compared to EUR 153.2 million in the previous year. The introduction of IFRS 16
had an impact of EUR 24.5 million on amortisation and depreciation. Amortisation, depreciation, write-downs and
provisions include EUR 3.0 million for impairment of fixed assets and EUR 1.4 million for provisions for risks.

At constant exchange rates, EBIT would have been EUR 151.2 million, down 1.3% compared to 2018.

Net financial debt as at 31 December 2019 was EUR 239.6 million, with a decrease of EUR 15.8 million compared to
EUR 255.4 million as at 31 December 2018. The change in the net debt was affected by an additional EUR 84.3 million
due to the introduction of IFRS 16. Net of this impact, the reduction of net financial debt would have been EUR 100.1

million. In addition, EUR 63.4 million of investments were made and EUR 22.3 million of dividends were paid out in May.
