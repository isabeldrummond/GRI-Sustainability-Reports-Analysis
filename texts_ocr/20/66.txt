Energy consumption in the waste management sector has decreased compared to 2017 and has remained in
line with the 2018 data, trend in line with the one observed also for the energy intensity index (calculated using

tons of waste collected as the denominator).

C02 EMISSIONS

Cement production has one of the highest levels of energy
consumption and GHG (Greenhouse Gas] emissions of all industrial
processes and is responsible for 5% of global GHG emissions.

The Cementir Group is striving to find economically sustainable
solutions to limit GHG emissions from the combustion of raw
materials (responsible for approximately 40% of CO2 emissions). This
mainly involves the use of alternative fuels with a high calorific value
to replace fossil fuels. Early-stage experimental projects are also
ongoing to reduce COQz emissions that are defined as process
emissions because they are associated with limestone
decarbonisation; this chemical reaction is responsible for about 60%
of cement production emissions, which are difficult to curtail with
current technology.

To curb this latter aspect, studies on cement mixes are ongoing, to
establish whether clinker, the fundamental component of cement
production, could be partly replaced with innovative materials with a
lower environmental impact without altering product quality.
Opportunities for the Group in this area are affected by possible
changes to the regulatory framework in Turkey regarding waste
