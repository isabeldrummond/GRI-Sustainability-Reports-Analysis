of managed waste to be sent for treatment and an increased production of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) by
companies operating in the recycling management sector.
In 2019, total COz2 equivalent emissions (direct and indirect) from the production of cement amounted to

about 7.8 million tons and about 92% of these were direct emissions (Scope 1).

Cementir has set CO2 emission reduction targets, using a 1990 baseline, for grey and white cement production.
The 2030 target includes a 35% reduction for white cement (equivalent to 808 kg/TCE in 2030) and 31%
reduction for grey cement (equivalent to 500 kg/TCE in 2030).

The above-mentioned targets will be achieved through greater use of alternative fuels, reduction of thermal
consumption and lowering the clinker content of cement through the use of alternative raw materials [as
described in the “In waste, we see resources: we promote a circular economy” chapter).

In the production of ready-mixed concrete, COz equivalent emissions are significantly lower. Emissions

generated by the production of ready-mixed concrete were in line with the previous years.

comparing last year, however, emissions from these activities are residual compared to the other Group activities.
