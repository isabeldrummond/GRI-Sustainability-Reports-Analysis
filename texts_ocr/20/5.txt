LETTER TO THE STAKEHOLDERS

 

Dear Stakeholders,

most climate experts agree that the world must take urgent action to cut emissions and we cannot deny that
cement manufacturing is an energy and CO: intensive process. We consider ourselves a responsible member
of the community we live in and, as such, our part is to promote initiatives and solutions that bring wellbeing

to society.

Sustainability must guide our day-by-day operations.

In the last years, the Group has been actively committed to pursue a program inspired by the principles of the
circular economy which envisages a Series of initiatives focused on reducing the environmental impact of our
activities and on developing lower COz intensity products but, in 2019, Cementir decided to take more disruptive

actions for fighting climate change and granting a better tomorrow for society and our company.

For this purpose, we established the Group Sustainability Committee {(GSC] with the primary objective of
assisting the Board of Directors in defining the sustainability strategy, indicating the main objectives and areas
of intervention to be reflected in the Industrial Plan and providing indications and recommendations to the
Board of Directors and other Bodies within the company on policies, guidelines and KPIs linked to sustainability

objectives.

The Group set 25 Sustainability Targets covering the priority areas for Cementir. The targets are related to the
effort of Cementir for adopting all necessary measures and the most innovative technological solutions to
minimise the impact of our business on the environment; creating a healthy, safe and inclusive work
environment; respecting human rights and creating a constructive and transparent relationship with the local

communities and business partners.
