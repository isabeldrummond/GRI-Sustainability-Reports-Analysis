The Aalborg production plant has a system for recovering
heat from combustion gases used. The thermal energy recovered from
the system is used to supply the district heating network of the city

of Aalborg, meeting the annual heating requirements

In 2019, the Aalborg Plant provided 1,6 milion GigaJoule of thermal energy to the local community.

 

In 2019, 7 cement plants adopted the EN ISO 50001 certification for energy management systems, in line with
our goal of increasing the level of energy efficiency.

Cementir has committed that all operating companies in the cement production, concrete production and
waste management sectors have to operate with a certified energy management system li.e. ISO 50001).

As of 2019, the 33% of all operating companies are certified ISO 50001, in 2025 the percentage will be double
to 71% while in 2030 the goal is that all operating companies will be certified.

The ready-mixed concrete production plants, which have an energy requirement that is far lower than cement
plants, used about 70,000 GJ of electricity and 284,000 GJ of thermal energy. The energy intensity index for these

plants was calculated using tons of concrete and aggregates produced during the year as the denominator.
