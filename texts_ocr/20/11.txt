GROUP’S STAKEHOLDERS

Management of the Group’s main stakeholders varies in terms of method and the frequency of listening and
involvement, based on type of subject, topic, interest and characteristics of the Group's various regions.
Considering the Parent Company is a Holding, some of these stakeholders’ interface directly with central
structures, while others are purely interested in performing the local activities of Group plants and the
management of relations with those subjects is delegated to the regional level. Therefore, frequencies of
stakeholder engagement and topics discussed with them vary by stakeholder category and countries where
the Group operates.
