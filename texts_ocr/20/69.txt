WATER CONSUMPTION

The cement and concrete production processes do not have a high impact on water resources. In dry cement
production processes, water is used principally to cool the systems and for conditioning the kiln gases; in wet
and semi-wet production processes, on the other hand, the specific consumption of water resources is higher
as the water is vaporised during the production process. The water discharge is not significant in quantity or
in pollutant concentration.

The increase in 2019 data is mainly due to the inclusion of water withdrawal at the US plant of LWCC [the

American company acquired in 2018). Below are the consumption data:

Over the years, the Cementir Group plants have adopted some technical solutions in order to reuse or use

water resources more efficiently.

In the production of ready-mixed concrete, water is one of the most relevant resource in the production process

as it represents an input resource. Water consumption decreased during the last year.

In the Group's other activities, water consumption is more or less irrelevant, as it is not linked to production processes"®.

“The data for 2018 were restated due to an erroneous allocation of municipal water supplies or other public or private water utilities from CCB
(cement & aggregates plants]

"The Clypot quarry in the material extraction phase collects a volume of water that is entirely reused (626,843 m* in 2019]. While companies operating
in the waste management sector have significantly lower water withdrawals compared to the cement and ready-mixed concrete sectors. In 2019,
the water consumption for waste management sector was about 10.000 m° {in 2018 the water consumption was about 12.000 m*
