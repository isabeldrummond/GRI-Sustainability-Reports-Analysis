RISK ANALYSIS AND POLICIES ADOPTED

The Cementir Group continues to consolidate the structures that operate in 18 countries and 5 continents, with the
aim of increasing human resource integration and strengthening the organisational platform. The current market
landscape and the increasingly global context in which the Cementir Group operates demands timely, targeted
decisions to respond to the various organisation, remuneration, development, labour law and trade union
requirements. The Cementir Group identified a specific risk related to people management, namely the loss of
knowledge and professional skills that leads to a discontinuity in work. To monitor this risk, Cementir Group is
evaluating the adoption of a specific KPI and targets.

In 2019, the Group finalised the growth plan of its organisational strategy, launched during the previous years, in
order to make its structure better suited to achieving targets set in the 2019-2021 Business Plan and to respond
more effectively to market trends and corporate changes. In particular, we have secured several key processes by
adopting a dedicated policy and procedure [e.g. Investment management procedure, Group privacy policy, Group
diversity policy) and we have finalised some Corporate and local organisational structures (Finance, HR, Audit, Legal,
North America).

Furthermore, we have renewed the European Works Council agreement for the next 4 years and we have launched
the Cementir 4.0 Programme in order to improve our operational efficiency in Technical and Logistic organisation in
two pilot plants, Gaurain and Aalborg.

The Group carried on strengthening the Holding, further developing the professional families model and enhancing
integration and synergy between the different Group structures. The integration and management process was
carried forward by the Group Chief Operating Officer (COO) supported by the Corporate Human Resources
department. The COO is responsible for the main business operating levers reporting directly to the Group's CEO,
who performs a more strategic role.

During 2019, we have started a digitalisation journey of core HR processes at Group level, with the implementation
of the Human Capital Management system based on SAP technology. This system will improve the efficiency of HR

processes and enable HR data analytics.

voice Gd: GROUP PEOPLE SURVEY

Cementir Group’s HR Strategy as the enabler of our Group's Business Strategy is focused on three main pillars;
«Group Integration and Identity», «Organizational Effectiveness and Agility», «People Development and Engagement».
In line with its Group HR Strategy, Cementir Group launched its first Global People Survey, “Your Voice” in 2019. The
objective is to ensure structured and comprehensive feedback on the three pillars of our strategy from our employees
to gather actionable insights and ideas to define the right developmental areas for our improvement journey.

All Cementir Employees working in offices and in production environments were in scope of the survey. The
comprehensive communication strategy deployed, together with the ownership of the management teams, engaged
our employees in the initiative with an overall participation rate of 83%.

The results are communicated back to the whole organization, analysed and discussed within the Action Teams with
