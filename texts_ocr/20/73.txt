DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

The production sector in which the Group operates is historically characterised by a
predominantly male component. Analysing the data on personnel distribution shows

that almost 87% of employees are male. This is widely linked to a net prevalence of

 

men amongst workers (the main personnel component).
In the last years, the Group has developed measures to promote equal gender treatment and opportunities in the
entire organisation, starting by defining Group Values and a Leadership competency model in which the concepts
of inclusion and diversity appreciation are well represented. Specifically, work has been done to define and
implement a structured communication plan on Group Identity in all company structures and to design and
implement an online training course on Group Values and Leadership Model. This involved all Group managers
and all Corporate employees and will be progressively rolled out to the entire company population.

Furthermore, the organisation has always been committed to appreciating and valuing diversity in all HR
processes such as people hiring, management, evaluation and development, by avoiding any discriminatory
approach, starting from the management of recruiting processes and on leadership and talent development

programmes. Here below is a breakdown of personnel by professional category and age range.

As the Cementir Group operates internationally, managing diversity also means paying attention to cultural
and religious differences. The Group deals in some countries with issues that are sensitive from a religious
point of view: in Malaysia, for example, special prayer rooms have been set up in the plant, according to the
differing religious beliefs of employees. Moreover, consumption of certain foods has been forbidden out of
respect for cultural differences.

Finally, the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), concerning the abolition
of forced labour, collective bargaining, and the elimination of child labour and discrimination, have been
ratified’? in most of the countries where the Group operates. In those countries where they have not been

ratified, the Group has defined clear policies relating to these agreements in the Code of Ethics, which states:

"The figures for 2018 have been restated due to a different allocation of ernployee by category and Headcount by age from LWCC, CCB and SCT.
