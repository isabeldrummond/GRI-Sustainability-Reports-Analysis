We respect the environment
in all our operations

We adopt all necessary measures and the most innovative technological solutions
to minimise the impact of our business on the environment.

 

RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT

We want to build a better tomorrow, creating value for society and for our company. Progress offers multiple opportunities
but poses important challenges such as the increase in carbon emissions, the depletion of natural resources and the

production of waste. The world’s climate experts agree that the world must take urgent action to bring down emissions.

CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY

In order to support in the fight against climate change, Cementir Group has developed a strategy which aims
at mitigating climate change and which is focused on the following pillars:
¢ fossil fuels and clinker replacement with alternative fuels and alternative mineral additives. The Group targets
have differentiated goals for grey and white cement and these have been deployed in each single plant.
Concerning grey cement, by 2030 Cementir will use 77% of alternative fuels and will lower the clinker ratio to
69%, while for white cement alternative fuels will amount to 6% and the clinker ratio will be lowered to 80%;
development of low-carbon cement [FUTURECEM™}, which allows CO2 emissions to be reduced by 30%.
FUTURECEM™ is a proprietary patented technology which uses limestone and calcined clay to such an
extent as to significantly reduce the amount of clinker in cement. The Group decided to reduce 30% of COz
emissions per ton of cement by 2030;
technological innovation and development of special products that complete the
existing portfolio, developing new business models with downstream integration
projects or strategic partnerships and promoting innovative applications and
products including ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), glassfibre reinforced
concrete (GRC), magnetic concrete and 3D printing;
* energy recovery. The Aalborg plant recovers excess heat from cement
production to provide district heating to local inhabitants. The recovered
thermal energy is used to heat the homes of about 36,000 families in the city

of Aalborg, with a saving of CO2 emissions equal to 300 kg CO2/t compared to

 

the use of a coal-fired power plant. We are investing to expand the heating to
50,000 families, to cover almost half of the Aalborg population;

* commitment to carbon-related public policy. Cementir actively participates in global and national industry policy
discussions on issues related to Climate Change, Sustainable Infrastructure, Circular Economy, Alternative
Fuels, and Waste Management Frameworks, among others. Since November 2019, the Group has been involved
in the most ambitious COz reduction project ever sponsored by a national government. In autumn 2019 the Danish
government made a broad political agreement with all political parties, including one at parliamentary level
about a binding climate law with the target of reducing Danish CO2 emissions by 70% by 2030 compared with the
1990 baseline. The Managing Director of Cementir’s subsidiary Aalborg Portland is leading the climate
partnership for the Danish energy intensive industry. The working group will provide the Danish government with
the technical forecast of all potential CO2 reduction achievable and will define the prerequisites (policy, research,

innovation, subsidies, etc.) for such reductions.
