SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS

We want to build a better tomorrow, creating value for society and for our company. Progress offers multiple
opportunities but poses important challenges such as the reduction of carbon emissions, the depletion of
natural resources and the production of waste.

Among the many challenges in front of us, sustainable growth is one of the most difficult. For our Group,
sustainable growth is both a responsibility and a requirement for continuing to work in the cement sector,
which has to deal more than most with a world where resources are limited. For this reason, the Group’s
business model must strike the right balance between the creation of economic value, the protection and
conservation of the environment and a sense of responsibility towards people and communities.
Strengthened by this conviction, the Group has identified 4 pillars that represent the benchmark principles
that have inspired this document and the company’s defined sustainability strategy, which are translated into
an action plan that take account of the specific nature of each country:

1. In waste, we see resources: we promote a circular economy

2. We respect the environment in all our operations

3. We value our people

4. We support our communities

In 2019 the Group progressed along its path to promoting sustainable growth by establishing a series of
sustainability targets covering the four pillars of the Group.

The targets have been defined by the Sustainability Team in collaboration with regional and corporate functions
and according to the guidelines established by the Sustainability Committee.

The Group Management Team [GMT], is accountable for managing the projects and achieving the targets.
The internal audit is responsible the periodic monitoring of the activities implemented in reference to the
Group's sustainability strategy and its targets.

Yearly, in the Sustainability Report, Cementir will share its progress toward achieving these targets with its
stakeholders.

In the next page is an indication, for each of the four pillars identified by Cementir, of the main targets and

objectives, of the reference UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and of the results obtained in 2019.
