THE CEMENTIR GROUP

CEMENTIR HOLDING ANTITRUST PROGRAM

The corporate culture and basic principles, to which the Group management attaches great importance and
which have always characterised the development activities of the Company and of the Cementir Group in its
entirety, are: the firm belief that a competitive market is a key value not only for customers but for the healthy
growth of the Group business itself; the commitment to have people from all over the Group operate
independently from competitors, relying only on their own skills and expertise, on coordination with the rest
of the Group and on the high quality of the Group's products.

These values are spread by the affiliates in the various geographical areas where they operate, by adopting
consistent, localised antitrust compliance programmes, directed to all employees and executives, informing
them about the underlying values, the basic principles of competition law and the specific regulations
applicable to their activities, also through specific training events on the subject.

The antitrust compliance programmes adopted locally focus on issuing specific policies, monitoring their
application through regular audit procedures, to ensure constant adequacy and correct implementation, as
well as on updating the programme itself, wherever necessary in order to take into account any regulatory
and/or legal developments.

Under each competition compliance programme, all relevant actions and transactions of the company are
monitored and their compliance with competition law requirements and practices duly scrutinised.
Distribution and sales contract templates are made available to the employees concerned and regular checks
are made to ensure their constant alignment with competition rules and pricing policies.

Furthermore, specific courses are administered to newcomers, targeting those joining the sales department.

RELEVANT LITIGATION

A dispute is pending between the Turkish stock exchange’s regulatory, supervisory body (Capital Market Board -
CMB] and the Turkish company Cimentas AS, an indirect subsidiary of Cementir Holding, over the intragroup
sale price of an equity investment in 2009, in which the CMB called on Cimentas AS to demand that Cementir
Holding and any other companies involved in the Cementir Group pay back around 100 million Turkish lira
(now around EUR 16 million]. The request for a suspension of the decision challenged by Cimentas, accepted
by Ankara Administrative Court on 26 May 2015, was subsequently rejected by Ankara Regional Administrative
Court on 6 August 2015 for entirely procedural reasons. A decision on the action for dismissal brought by
Cimentas AS against CMB was accepted by Ankara Administrative Court on 0? November 2018, which
cancelled the CMB decision (not on the merits but on the precise quantification of the amount due]. The dispute
is still pending before the Appeal Court. On 29 January 2017, CMB served a summons to Cementir Holding to
appear before the Court of izmir, requesting that the company be ordered to pay Cimentas AS an amount
provisionally set at approximately 1 million Turkish lira. Cementir Holding duly filed a defence case, arguing
the total groundlessness of the plaintiff's argument, both procedurally and on the merits, and in any case
requesting the suspension of the civil case until the administrative action is settled. In the unlikely event that
this administrative action is rejected, the issue would in any case solely be relevant between companies in the
Cementir Group.

The main reason presented by Cimentas AS for disputing the request made by CMB is related to the fiscal
dispute entered into for the same transaction. Cimentas AS had won at first level and, on appeal, the tax
authority, on 15 November 2018, confirmed the decision of the first level body, with presumable positive effects
on the civil dispute with CMB.
