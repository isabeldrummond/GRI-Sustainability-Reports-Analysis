During the year, 19 accidents occurred to contractors and contract staff who worked in the Group plants [for
a total of 295 working days lost}, a lower number compared to that of 2018 (27). We also regret to report two
fatalities within subcontractors. The circumstances surrounding these accidents have been examined in detail.

Our focus is on ensuring appropriate actions and lessons learned are communicated across the Group.
