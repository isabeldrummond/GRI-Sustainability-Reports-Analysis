OTHER AIR EMISSIONS

The environmental impact of cement production also involves other air emissions, mainly sulphur oxides (S02)
and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These are associated with combustion in the firing of raw meal that is obtained from
processing raw materials and from dust that is generated when grinding the clinker
eel NACo ReohatergciemleMve= tis (cre Nola ey] with gypsum and other ingredients to produce cement. Emissions are monitored
: through continuous monitoring systems or through spot measurements, in
accordance with local regulations and in consideration of the characteristics of the
plants. The monitored data is periodically communicated to the competent
authorities, which verify compliance with the limits in the plants.

In 2019, NOx emissions from the Cementir Group plants amounted to 9,598 tonnes,
with an emission index per ton of cement (kg/t TCE) of 0.98, while S02 emissions
originating from sulphur in the fuels and raw materials used in Group plants
amounted to 1,431 t, with an emissions index per ton of cement (g/t TCE) of 146.

 

The CO emissions amounted to 13,304 t with an emission index per ton of cement
(kg/tTCE) of 1.35, with a slight increase compared to the previous year (1.24 kg/tTCE).
Finally, dust emissions reached 348 t with a dust emissions index per ton of cement (g/t TCE] of 35, lower than

2018 (45 g/TCE). To reduce their impact, some plants updated their technologies for reducing air emissions.
