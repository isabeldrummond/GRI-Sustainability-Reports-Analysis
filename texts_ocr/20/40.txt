The Board also appoints a non-executive director as Senior Non-Executive Director to serve as the chair of the
Board as referred to under Dutch law according to the Company's Articles of Association and Board Rules. The
Senior Non-Executive Director cannot be a former Executive Director and must be independent in accordance
with Best Practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code. The Senior Non-Executive Director cannot be the chair of the Audit
Committee or the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.

The Board may designate one (1] or more of its Non-Executive Directors as vice-chairman for a period decided by

with the duties of the Senior Non-Executive Director entrusted to him by the Board.

The Board has established two committees from within its ranks to provide advice and submit proposals: the Audit
Committee and the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.

The current composition of the Board of Directors shows a satisfactory degree of diversity and it also meets the
target set by Dutch law on gender ratio, i.e. at least 30% for each gender. It is also compliant with the diversity
policy and the profile approved by the Board where diversity is not based exclusively on gender and age, but also
on technical and professional skills, which must be taken into account when appointing new members of the

Board of Directors and committees of the Group.
