METHODOLOGY NOTE

The Cementir Group Sustainability Report - Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (SR or NFS), has been
prepared in compliance with EU directive 2014/95 on the disclosure of non-financial and diversity information,
and in accordance to the related Dutch decrees [PbEU, 2014, L330 and PbEU, 2014, L330), because of the
transfer of the Holding’s registered office from Rome to Amsterdam.

The Report consolidates the information on the entire Cementir Group; it therefore includes the data on the
parent company and its fully consolidated subsidiaries’. Furthermore, it also fully consolidates the non-financial
data on the subsidiary SCT which, in the Group's Financial Report, is consolidated applying the proportional
method [since it is controlled jointly at 65%). Any limits to the scope of reporting are clearly identified in the text
and do not significantly affect understanding of the Group's business, its performance or its results.

The qualitative and quantitative information reported in the NFS derives from a data-gathering process
performed at the levels of Holding and single legal entity, using excel reporting packages.

The Report discloses the data for the period 1 January 2019 - 31 December 2019, is drafted annually, and is
approved by the Board of Directors of Cementir Holding NV. Previous years’ data are included for comparative
purposes in order to enable an assessment, in time, of the performance of the Group. Any restatement of data
reported in previous years is clearly indicated in the document.
