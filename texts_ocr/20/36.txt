THE CEMENTIR GROUP

marketing, supply chain, customer service, technical service, laboratory, etc.] - improves the Group’s visibility
in the customer value chain.

All of this is essential to allow the Group to offer a differentiated and tailor-made value proposition, ranging
from products to value-added services (complete logistics management, online software tools, web-ordering,
dedicated testing programmes, etc.], as well as co-development and innovation initiatives.

Targeting industrial users and the main decision-makers in the construction sector, the Group has developed
services and mobilised resources and expertise to provide a holistic view of both cost and environmental
impact, thereby enabling customers to identify how best to optimise performance. Cementir values these
close and reciprocal relationships, which are based on a common desire to find the most sustainable and
cost-effective solutions to solve complex challenges in material production and construction.

The Group exports to over 70 markets and is trying to further develop its direct approach with white cement
customers so as to further enhance the Group’s stable and sustainable position on the market. This strategic
roadmap was launched in recent years, with the aim of exploiting the full potential of structured and direct
customer management. The Group has developed a comprehensive local sales and logistics network in more

than 20 countries.

ANEW PERSPECTIVE: HEARING THE CUSTOMER’S VOICE AND MEASURING PERFORMANCE

While operating in a traditional sector, the Group has moved towards a more customer-centric approach. The
process Started internally as a complex management process, for which management and teams received
extensive training and were rewarded based on customer-driven goals and initiatives using “lean” tools.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) models and systems have been fully implemented in the Europe
and Asia-Pacific regions. Today, most sales and marketing teams use CRM worldwide to track, measure and
develop the quality and results of each individual customer relationship, including to anticipate their needs
and business opportunities.

Listening to and understanding the customer's voice is a fundamental approach that begins with day-to-day
customer management through each product delivery and extends into more sophisticated and customised
activities. The approach aims to respond effectively and quickly to customers’ needs and the problems that
arise from feedback throughout the journey with the customer; a further objective is to integrate the
understanding of customer needs into business processes and to use their feedback to build long-term
strategies, inspire business decisions and promote continuous improvement.

In addition to some transactional surveys and “informal” monitoring of relationships as part of the entire
Group's day-to-day business, in Europe, Malaysia and China, the Group also conducted a customer survey
(annually or biennially depending on the business and market) to investigate a number of issues from an
external point of view, including: product quality, services, innovation, relationships, sales processes, after-
sales service and technical support. The results of this survey enable the Group to focus more on the
customer in commercial operations. The organisation uses these important results to develop plans to
optimise its value proposition and to further improve customer satisfaction. The survey also identifies areas
to be improved and oriented towards strategic inter-functional, inter-company and inter-regional initiatives,
some of which are incorporated in the Strategic Project Portfolio in the three-year Business Plan.

Among other indicators, Cementir has started to apply the Net Promoter Score [NPS] methodology lin Europe
from 2014 and in the Asia-Pacific Region from 2018).

This methodology allows direct dialogue with customers in order to continuously improve customer experience
and to strengthen their loyalty. The latest 2019 results show an NPS of 49 for exports of white cement in
Europe, up by 74 in Denmark.

The NPS achieved by Asia-Pacific is 45 and is specifically to be assigned to China.
