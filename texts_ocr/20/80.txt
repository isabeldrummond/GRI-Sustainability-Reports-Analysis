EARTHQUAKE IN ELAZIG

On 24 January 2020, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred in Elazig province, in Turkey. More than 30 people
were killed and more than 1,600 injured.

In the following hours after the earthquake, Cimentas donated 1 million Turkish lira (approx. EUR 150,000) to
the local authorities and opened the plant to provide accommodation to people whose houses had been
damaged. The guest house at the Elazig plant was opened to the evacuated people. As of March 2020, Cimentas

management in Elazig is in close coordination with local authorities to give support to the local community.

CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK

Between December 2019 and February 2020, a fast-moving virus originating in China and known as the “new
coronavirus” has infected tens of thousands of Chinese citizens and spread to more than 30 countries. In
February 2020, our Chinese plant has been temporary closed and a donation has been made to the local
authorities that are facing this public health emergency. The health and well-being of our employees and
partners are our priority, for this reason, the Chinese plant will gradually restart the operations in close

consultation with the suppliers and public health experts.

 

Cimentas Education and Health Foundation

In Turkey, Cementir Group maintains close ties with the most vulnerable groups through the
Cimentas Education and Health Foundation, established in 1986 and committed to providing
financial assistance and educational materials to families and schools. Since its establishment,
the Foundation has sponsored over 500 scholarships for high school pupils and university students
and has contributed to the renovation of various school buildings close to the plant in Elazig, Turkey.
In 1998, the Cimentas Education and Health Foundation established the Isikkent High
School. This high school is recognised for its innovative approach to education and research
and can accommodate up to 770 pupils a year. As part of this project, education is provided
at all educational levels from nursery to high school. https://www.isikkent.k12.tr/en-US.

 

 

RECOVERY OF HEAT FROM KILN FUEL

As described above, the Aalborg plant recovers surplus production heat to supply district heating to the population of
Aalborg. In 2019, the heat supplied corresponded to the annual consumption of approx. 36,000 households.

In addition to this initiative, the Aalborg plant has decided to use the cold water from the chalk lake used for cement
production to provide a cooling system for the new town hospital as an energy-efficient alternative

to conventional electric cooling systems. “District cooling” is a cooling system equivalent to district

heating. Cold water is pumped through a closed loop to the buildings to be cooled. The water absorbs
the heat from the buildings and is pumped back for cooling, which in this case is performed by the
lake's cold water.

According to the local companies of utility services (Aalborg Utility], the district cooling from Aalborg
Utility is expected to be at least five times as efficient as conventional cooling solutions and far less

space consuming. With the new facility, Aalborg Utility expects that the hospital will be able to save

 

around 80 percent of their current electricity use as compared with the old cooling facility. Additionally,
they estimate yearly emissions savings of around 500-700 tonnes CO2.

Finally, some Group companies, particularly those whose plants are in areas of greater social marginalisation, have

made donations to local communities. These were in the form of cash and goods donations, including over 1,300 tons

of cement mostly allocated to the restoration and to the renovation of schools and public infrastructure.
