of buildings in the period 1970-2000 no Noa Museu ine

limited its use in markets with very ;
low labour costs. The material and i
the technology now have the ‘
potential to meet high and complex
demands in modern society, far
exceeding the relatively higher
production costs associated with
the increased amount of work
required for its production.

The Cementir Group has been a
member of, among others, the
International GRC Association since
2016, with the aim of helping to lead

and playing an active role in

 

supporting the future development of this technology. This membership is in line with AALBORG WHITE®’s
strategic objective to focus on the development of market- and customer-oriented technologies and applications.
As part of the activities in the InWhite ™ process, Cementir Group is further developing the technology and
its application, in order to provide know-how and assistance to customers globally, facilitating and supporting

their growth. Furthermore, a particularly suited pre-mix for this application is under development.

EXPLORING NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH 3D PRINTED CONCRETE: AALBORG EXPLORE™

The 3D printing of concrete is a group of processes leading to the creation of physical concrete objects, layer
by layer, offering the largest available freedom of design, and detaching from the “traditional” mould-confined
production framework of concrete. Furthermore, it is generally believed to minimise the usage of material,
maximise the potential customisation of each unit and minimise labour costs.

Cementir Group does not see this new technology as a replacement for the traditional concrete production
process, but more like a supplement, exploiting its customisation capacities, and generally expanding the
applications of concrete.

However, the technology is not mature yet, and there are many challenges for its use as a scalable production
technology, such as lack of standards, high initial
Cement plant Aalborg, Denmark investments, inefficient use on sites, the ability to operate
continuously and autonomously, etc.

For the last year, as part of the InWhite™ process, Cementir
Group has been running an initiative on 3D concrete
printing, assessing its applicability and alignment to mega
trends and quantifying the impact in the value chain. As part
of this, the Group has joined a new research project in
Denmark as knowledge partner and supplier of raw
material.

The Cementir Group intends to play a leading role in
developing this technology and expects to market in 2020 a

new high-performance dry premix, Aalborg Explore™, for

  

3D printing. This cutting-edge product leverages on the
technical and aesthetic performance of AALBORG WHITE®.
