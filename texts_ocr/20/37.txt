WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING

Waste is not only a source of recyclable material, but also of alternative fuels with a high calorific value. Using
alternative fuel derived from industrial and solid urban waste has major environmental advantages, both
because it reduces the use of fossil fuels and because it offers a solution to the problems of storage and
disposal.

Cementir Holding was one of the leading industrial players to capitalise on these opportunities and since 2009
has been operating in the renewable energy and urban and industrial waste management and processing
sector. These operations are conducted through Recydia, which owns the Hereko and Sureko businesses in
Turkey, and Neales Waste Management in England, where in addition to its waste treatment plant the company
manages a landfill that enables the production of renewable energy by transforming food waste into biogas.
Hereko is engaged in the management of solid urban waste and has signed a contract with the City of Istanbul
lasting 25 years (until 2036). Its integrated mechanical-biological treatment plant in Komiirciioda, in the Sile
area (Istanbul), is the largest in Europe, the only one of its type in Turkey, and can handle 2,000 tons of solid
urban waste per day.

Through its modern facility located to the west of the city of Izmir, Sureko is engaged in the management of
industrial and hazardous waste and the production of alternative fuels that are used at the Izmir plant.

NWM Holding, through its subsidiaries Neales Waste Management Ltd and Quercia, is one of the leading providers
of hazardous and non-hazardous waste treatment, recycling and disposal services in the North West of England.
The Groupâ€™s plants use the most advanced biological technologies to produce alternative fuels and thermal
energy, minimising landfill waste and contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Storage of urban waste releases methane, a greenhouse gas with a polluting effect 21 times greater than that
of carbon dioxide. Therefore, using urban waste as alternative fuel in cement plants is fundamentally important
because it contributes to the sustainable disposal of waste and reducing the negative effects of greenhouse
gases. Moreover, unlike the process in waste-to-energy plants, use of waste as alternative fuel in cement
plants does not produce residues as the ash deriving from combustion is recycled in cement production.

To achieve these results, the Cementir Group uses applicable and well-tried integrated solutions, and has
invested for years in the development and the widespread use of innovative technologies for waste

management and fuels from waste, such as for example sorting, recycling and biodrying.
