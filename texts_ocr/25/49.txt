The headline accident rate is greater
in maritime terminals than in land-
based
companies. Indeed, in portterminals,

logistics and intermodal

about 70% of staff are operational,
with handling duties on board ship
and in the yard and are therefore

 

 

exposed to a greater accident risk.
All the groupâ€™s maritime terminals
have adopted the OHSAS 18001-
certified Safety management
system, with procedures promoting
a safety culture to prevent accidents
and protect staff.
