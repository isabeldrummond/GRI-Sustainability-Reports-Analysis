BEST PRACTICE

OT OTe CL ee)
Italy with 100% LED lighting. All the
lighting units were replaced with latest-
generation LEDs between 2015 and
2017 in a major project representing an
investment of over 1 million Euro.

This included not only the 22 floodlight
towers lighting the container storage
and handling yard and Cagliari Canal
Port quay but also all the lights on the
yard cranes (RTG) and quay cranes
(QC), those in the workshop and the
warehouse, and all the office lighting
ENACHUIIS

This investment immediately cut the
terminal's electricity consumption -

Although the consumption depends on
the volumes handled, we estimate that
this efficiency initiative will save 40-45%
on the standard energy charges for
lighting the yard and quay.

LED technology also helps to enhance
performance. Not only do LEDs come
on immediately even when cold but
their longer life also helps to spread
maintenance costs over a longer
timeframe. (A blue LED lamp lasts for
50,000 hours and a monochromatic one
for 10,000, compared with 750 hours
for incandescent lamps and 7,500 for
fluorescent tubes.)

sources, thanks to the lamps’ low power
