Employment, on the maritime manpower and worker retraining

terminal side, is gradually growing
in La Spezia as a direct result of both
the rising volumes over the years
and its positioning as a gateway for
central and southern Europe.

Numbers are stable in Cagliari,
reflecting the type of market served
(transhipment), which supports
fewer jobs in allied industries than
gateway services do.

As regards transhipment, the Gioia
Tauro terminal saw a significant
headcount reduction in the last
year due to a progressive decline in
volumes handled and a manpower
reorganization, | where surplus
staff were re-employed at a port

agency set up by Gioia Tauro Port
Authority.

The logistics sector has enjoyed
constant growth over the years, in
line with trends in the market, which
sees intermodal transport as key to
competitiveness for the ports served.
Over the last decade, Contship Group
has invested heavily in developing its
services and infrastructure for land-
based logistics.

A visible product of this strategy
has been the creation of dedicated
companies to provide intermodal-
transport and rail-traction services
and run intermodal terminals,
employing over 400 staff between
them as of December 2017.
