GOVERNANCE

A new Group governance was
introduced in September 2016 with
the objective to simplify and speed

up the Group’s responses to the
changes in the industry and its rapid
evolution.

 

Back in 2012, Contship adopted a
Code of Ethics setting out the core
values underpinning the group’s
work. All activities must be legally
compliant, informed by principles of
fair competition, honesty, integrity,
propriety and good faith. They must
have proper regard for the legitimate
interests of customers, employees,
shareholders, commercial and
financial partners, and the
associations of which Contship Italia
group companies form part.

Although not every group subsidiary
yet hasan organisation, management
and control model under Legislative
Decree 231/2001, the new governance
scheme has also involved an
overhaul of the group’s procedures.

These now take a consistent group-
wide approach to prevent criminal
offences in the following areas:

¢ Purchasing

¢ Sponsorships, gifts and
donations

¢ Recruiting, selecting, hiring and
managing staff

* Salaries & Wages

¢ Refuelling company vehicles

¢ Employee expenses
reimbursement.

All the authorisation processes in
these areas, for example, require
multiple signatures to ensure
transparency and prevent offences
and abuse.
