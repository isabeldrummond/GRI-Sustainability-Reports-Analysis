REFRESHER TRAINING: IT’S ABOUT PREVENTION

The Refresher Training project was
devised in July 2012 under the auspices
of the OHSAS 18001 management
system to tackle a surge of accidents
(affecting workplace safety) in the
first half of 2012 that was entirely out
of kilter with the previous four years’
figures. An in-depth analysis of the
accidents in 2012 and those in previous
years showed that accident scenarios
were repeating cyclically, especially
those due to ‘incorrect worker
behaviour’, i.e. a failure to properly
apply the procedure governing a given
work phase.

WHAT IT COMPRISES

The project is a communication tool
that educates shift-workers about
risk awareness very quickly, reaching
large numbers of them (30-700) in
just a few weeks. It involves bite-size

Training is provided when an accident
occurs, to break the cycle of
recurrence for a known event.

Purely preventive training is also given,
independently of any accidents. Short

The Refresher Training programme
has been in constant use since 2013.
From 2014, the incidence of repeated
cyclical events has fallen to 1 per year
(against 8 in 2012).
