PORTOLAB: A UNIQUE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE

The PortoLab project was set up in
2006 to educate the public about
what happens in ports and intermodal
centres and what it is like to work
in these little-known, inaccessible,
traditionally closed worlds.

Every Tuesday and Thursday from
March to May, the La Spezia, Gioia Tauro,
Ravenna and Cagliari maritime terminals
and Melzo intermodal centre open
their gates to visiting primary-school
parties. The children enjoy a unique
guided experience with an innovative,
stimulating approach that shows them
what people do, and the skills and values
that go into their work.

The container terminal becomes a
workshop to support the schools’
classroom teaching. The ships’ routes
offer a lead-in to geography, while
the containers can be likened to the
amphoras used to transport goods
back in the mists of history. Every year,
over 2,000 children — armed with hard
hats, personalised badges and high-
vis jackets — visit the Contship Italia
Group terminals under the watchful
eye of the PortoLab tutors. This direct
experience, backed by the stories of
the professionals involved, helps the
youngsters discover a sector that
is vital for the development of the
communities where it operates.

The programme opens pupils’ eyes
to the container world and to the
contribution that transport makes to
their lives with all the things that they
and their families use every day.

The tutors, together with
representatives of many _ other
organizations working in the ports and
the intermodal centre (the customs
office, finance police, harbourmaster,
port authority, port chemist, etc.),
enthusiastically dedicate part of their
working lives to this initiative. Every
year, school leaders, project partners
and the science educators who look
after the teaching content join Contship
