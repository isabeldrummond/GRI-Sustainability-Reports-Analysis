AIR QUALITY
MANAGEMENT

 

Safeguarding air quality is a key
priority in the sustainable operation
of our business. We are reducing
our carbon footprint by investing
in quality transport and the best
technology on the market.
Intermodal goods transport
combines various modes (sea, rail
and road) to optimise the carriage
of goods and containers from origin
to destination, thus reducing energy
consumption and CO, emissions.

In particular, rail plays an essential
role in a_ sustainable logistics
strategy. In recent years, rail freight
traffic in Italy has experienced an
upturn, growing 4 times faster than
GDP (+89% against +2%) between
2014 and 2017. This is partly thanks to
government efforts to revitalise the
sector. However, private operators
have an increasingly vital role in
this context: 10 years ago the state
railway had a virtual monopoly (95%)
on freight transport by rail while in
2017, out of an estimated 51 million
train kilometres travelled, 45% was
attributable to the private sector.

The importance of air quality and
noise impact in maritime terminals
depends on their proximity
residential centres. Indeed,
