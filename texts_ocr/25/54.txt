relationships with an eye for
innovation and market conditions,
to ensure sustainable, high-quality
procurement.

To optimise costs, the Group draws
up standardised processes supported
by targeted IT instruments and
encourages framework agreements
to promote long-term relationships.
Suppliers are categorised and
monitored regularly through specific
procedures established as part of
the quality, safety and environment
(QSA) management system, with
the aim of ensuring an effective and
transparent procurement policy,
high-quality service to customers
and compliance with the laws
governing workplace health and
safety, environmental protection and
administrative accountability.

The categorisation criteria are
different for suppliers of goods/
products and suppliers of services.
In addition, a classification has been
drawn up by category (primary,
secondary and generic) and by level
of criticality, based on the degree
of direct influence on the service
provided to final customers.
