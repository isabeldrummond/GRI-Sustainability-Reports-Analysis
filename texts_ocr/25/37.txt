In 2013, Sogemar signed a programme
agreement with the Lombardy regional

Liscate town councils to carry out
mitigation, landscaping, environmental
and infrastructure-development work
in exchange for release of the relevant
areas by the rural park for the rail-
hub extension. Over 2 million Euro was
invested in planting 40,000 mÂ® of tall
trees, creating over 3 km of cycleways
and installing 1,000 metres of solar
panels.

The Melzo extension project is a win-
win solution. From a purely productive
standpoint, the capacity boost offers
a timely, efficient response to market
demand. And with the _ mitigation
and redevelopment initiatives, the
environmental benefits are clear not
only for the local area, but also ona global
scale, as the rail-transport investment
has had a major impact in slashing CO,
emissions. Hannibal and Oceanogate
have over 300 railway wagons between
them, around half of which are fitted with
low-environmental-impact brake shoes
for reduced noise and dust emissions. In
2017, our 5,715 trains travelled 1,110,035
km and saved around 13,000 tons of CO,
