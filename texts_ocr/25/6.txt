NOTE ON THE METHODOLOGY
AND SCOPE OF THE REPORT

 

This report by Contship is referring
to year 2017.

It is an important tool to measure the
Group’s performance with respect to
environmental, social and economic
sustainability.

This report has been prepared in
accordance with the GRI' Standards:
core option and with the fundamental
principles of balance, comparability,
accuracy, clarity, timeliness and
reliability.

The themes included in the report
provide a concise but exhaustive
picture of Contship’s approach to and
strategy for sustainability. The topics
were selected through a materiality
analysis which highlighted significant
issues relating to Contship’s activities
and stakeholders.

The first step was to select significant
topics, taking into consideration the
context of the sector in sustainability
terms and using the 2016 Eurogate
Sustainability Reportasa benchmark,
with adaptations as appropriate to
draw a representative picture of the
Contship reality.

The second step was to assess the
significance of each topic from a dual
perspective. First, the company’s
perspective, through the views of
management. And second, that of
stakeholders, through questionnaires
administered to various managerial
functions that have regular contacts

with and direct knowledge of the
different categories of stakeholder.
The materiality matrix was then
checked and further validated by
the team involved in the reporting
process.

The scope of the report includes
Group companies consolidated in the
financial statements of the holding
company, Contship Italia S.p.A., and
operating in the maritime terminals
of La Spezia, Gioia Tauro and Cagliari
and the inland logistics terminal at
Melzo, in the province of Milan.

To provide a more complete picture
of the Group, in the case of container
handling we decided to also include
the performance of the sea terminals
of Salerno, Ravenna and Tangiers,
which are operated by Group
companies that are notincludedinthe
consolidated financial statements.
The data presented refer to 2017,
with a comparison with one or more
previous years where this was deemed
useful to illustrate significant trend
lines.

The report consists of four chapters
outlining the Group’s profile and
its performance with respect to
environmental, social and economic
sustainability.

The annex contains a table showing
the correlation between the GRI
indicators and the content of the
report.
