WATER AND WASTE
MANAGEMENT

Water and waste-water manage-
ment is a topic that we take very se-
riously throughout the Group.

It is especially important at the
maritime terminals, which follow
targeted strategies to conserve this
precious resource and to reduce
discharges, by improving process
efficiency and re-using waste water.
At La Spezia, for example, a closed-

 

cycle biological plant for re-using
purified water and for treating
rainwater and the waste water from
vehicle washing has enabled us both
to save water and to cut our waste
and waste-water output.

In 2017, average water consumption
across the group fell by 13% year-on-
year.

Throughout the Group, waste is
separated out by EWC code, and
the material (iron, copper, oils, etc.)
is partially recovered. Recycled
waste thus becomes a resource,
yielding not only environmental
benefits but also economic value, in
line with the main principles of an

 

 

effective circular economy, which is
increasingly necessary.

Total waste production rose in 2017
compared to 2016, on account of
non-hazardous wastes (+13%) and the
volumes handled, while hazardous-
waste output fell (-3%).
