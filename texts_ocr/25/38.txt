LSCT

 

In 2014, LSCT conducted a study with a
Florence university spin-off company
to assess the direct and _ indirect
impact of the terminal's activities on the
environment around the port area.

MUaTeM ClMuiilar-]e-Mer:1u ele] aisle) (eM ial mele 1 cI)
evaluated, by calculating the equivalent
C02 emissions from the various sources
(direct and indirect)®.

The study considered measurements
and estimates of noise levels and air
quality (particulates, carbon monoxide,
sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide).
The study zone was mapped, first by
defining various categories of impact
‘receptors’, then evaluating their
vulnerability to the combined air-quality
and noise components. The study team
thus identified the most critical areas,
devising and implementing mitigation
initiatives that also took into account the
terminal expansion project.

Regarding atmospheric-pollutant emis-
sions, the La Spezia terminal is
pioneering the use of a bio fixative to
apply regularly along the roads in the
operating areas to reduce dust volatility
and enable the aromatic components
in the air to decompose. Combined with
daily sweeping of the yards and a focus
on the likely emission sources (vehicle
maintenance, etc.), this treatment helps
toreduce dust production andits impact.

LSCT has also made a systematic effort
to manage noise emissions, tailored to
the dynamics of the business, the type
of service offered, and the changing
scenarios, places and equipment.

Actions:

* an annual campaign to measure noise
emissions on the terminal perimeter

* monitoring subcontractors installing
and maintaining anti-noise devices
(silent blocks on trailers)

+ research and analysis of new acoustic
devices to fit to the machines for
better performance

: installing noise-absorbing barriers
around the operating area perimeter.

5Even though the local impactis not significant, assessing
the carbon footprint is important on a global level, as it
directly affects the climate.
