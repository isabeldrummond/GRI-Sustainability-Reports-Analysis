CONSUMPTIONS

 

Another key component of our en-
vironmental-protection and effi-
ciency strategy is our investment
in renewable energy.

In expanding our logistics centre

Table 1 - Energy production (solar)

and intermodal terminal at Melzo
(the Milan Rail Hub), we installed
1,000 metres of solar panels, which
generated over 140 MWh of clean
energy in 2017.

 

2017 compared to 2016
Energy production 141,577 Kw/h 510 GJ + 23%
CO, emission saving 75t + 33%

 

 

 

We consumed electricity to power
our vehicles, equipment, offices,
lighting systems and reefer towers.
Diesel consumption is largely due

to refuelling of operating vehicles
and is directly determined by the
volumes handled at the various
terminals.

 

 

 

2017 compared to 2016
Fuel consumption (diesel) 233,440 GJ -7%
Electricity consumption 174,927 GJ +0.5%

> of which non-renewable| 47,567,045 Kw/h | 171,241 GJ +0.4%
Total energy consumption 398,367 GJ -44%
