The ability to generate financial resources allows to
remain in the market and drives financial strength, in
the sense of economic sustainability. This leads to pro-
moting social sustainability, ie. meeting the expecta-
tions of stakeholders, as well as environmental sustain-
ability, that is minimising the environmental impact of
business operations.

The Company's financial resources consist of the result
from operating activities and the funding received
from the Parent Company, which has financial lever-
age of its own, and the surplus of loans received from
banks—evidence of the trust placed in our Company.
All this enables us to achieve the agreed goals and cre-
ates a virtuous cycle between the return on sales and
investments. We are working on ways to make and
receive payments together with credit institutions by
leveraging the opportunities offered by digitisation.
The Company holds regular meetings with lenders to
discuss its financial performance, financial position
and cash flows, and presents them with data from the

financial statements, the business plan, the budget,
and the Integrated Report on an annual basis. ®
Aspiag Service remains consistent with its choices
when it comes to sustainability also as part of its financ-
ing activities, and prefers working with lenders that
have implemented policies and decisions in this sense.
The Company's financial performance improved once
again in 2019. Net sales were up at both direct and fran-
chise retail stores, rising +4.2% and +4.7%, respectively.
Average spending was in line with 2018, and Eurospar
accounted for the lion's share of the total.

The economic value distributed by Aspiag Service in
2019, which particularly affects the Company’s suppli-
ers and employees, grew by 4.6%. Once again this year,
part of the economic value generated was distributed
to Shareholders as dividends. The value generated
and distributed within our trading area promoted the
growth of business operations as well as small- and
medium-sized firms in our community, in line with the
targets of SDG 8.
