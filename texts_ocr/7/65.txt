Aspiag Service’s environmental policy, endorsed by
the Managing Directors, governs the relationship
between the Company and the natural environment in
which it operates. Thanks to our efforts on this front,
we were Italy’s first Large Scale Distribution company
to achieve the ISO 14001* certification, which we are
gradually extending to our entire sales network and
is increasingly becoming a tenet of our approach to
sustainability. The certification was renewed also for
2019 and covers 43 stores as well as 2 offices. Besides
the certification, the Company has been pursuing

Energy

several other environmental initiatives over the years.
Among the most recent ones, in 2019 it distributed
free, 100%-recyclable BPA plastic water bottles to all
employees at Mestrino.

On that same day, it removed water bottles from vend-
ing machines and installed microfiltered cool water
dispensers in the site’s food courts. In the company
canteen, plastic cups were replaced with paper ones,
which are less polluting.

This initiative will be extended in the future also to the
employees at other offices. With respect to our envi-
ronmental strategy, we continue pursuing our strate-
gic guidelines in the following areas:

To monitor our stores, we use supervisory systems allowing to measure energy withdrawal and detect abnor-
mal energy consumption. The stores are remotely monitored and grouped into clusters based on brand, size, and
installed equipment, so as to identify consumption standards and monitor any potential anomalies by using dedi-
cated algorithms.

Average daily energy consumption was down 1.45% year-on-year, allowing to save €377,165 in energy costs. ©

The Company continues using renewable energy sources—specifically from photovoltaic systems—LED lighting,
which is still being implemented, and energy with guarantees of origin (“green energy”). We prevent frozen foods
from thawing by carefully managing them.

UNI EN 1S014001: this is an international standard of the ISO 14001 series that defines how to set up an environmen-
tal management system, setting out the requirements for the management system of any company. Achieving this
certification means that the company has in place an environmental management system appropriate for monitor-
ing the environmental impacts of its activities and that it strives to improve it.
