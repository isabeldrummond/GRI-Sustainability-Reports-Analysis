FOOD SAFETY

Food safety and quality are guaranteed by a careful
selection of suppliers and by the prior definition of
their structural and management prerequisites. These
prerequisites must ensure the utmost respect for the
hygiene rules in the production, handling and storage
of food throughout the supply chain.

Perishable goods and the entire internal production of
the butcher's department (minced and ready-to-cook
meat) are controlled through microbiological analysis
and superficial swabs on equipment such as food slic-
ers, tongs, cutting boards, knives and cleavers.

The result of the fight against vermin, as well as the
remote management service of the refrigeration
equipment in the retail stores, which consists of
remote access to read and check the storage tempera-
tures of refrigeration systems in all sales units, is avail-
able online.

Marketed products can be tracked through all stages
of distribution, as required by art. 18 of Regulation (EC)
178/02. Rapid procurement and distribution ensure
products stay fresh, as they are stored with state-
of-the-art equipment. 2019 saw an expansion in the
number of stores where organic products are sold
in bulk. The several internal inspections carried out

@ Voluntary quality analysis and controls

Samples analysed

are supported by additional inspections performed
by certified external bodies and include also those
conducted at the Meat Centre. In 2019, 363 cases of
non-compliance were found—down compared to the
previous year—which gave rise to €37,172 in adminis-
trative fines. During the year, there were no non-mon-
etary sanctions or cases settled out of court. Expenses
were up once again because of the new Quality
Department, which became operational in early 2019,
and the greater number of analyses performed. The
voluntary controls to ensure the health and safety of
our customers are in line with the target 3.d of SDG 3.
A working group on Food Safety - Quality Control has
been set up at Despar Italia’s office. This includes all
Despar franchisees in Italy in order to coordinate oper-
ations and create benefits across the board for private
label products. It is possible to manage all information
about, and any non-compliance issues related to, said
products from the Consortium’'s portal.

The Food Safety function has also worked together
with Federdistribuzione on the manual on good
hygienic practices for Large Scale Distribution compa-
nies, which was finalised this year and updates inspec-
tions as well as food storage practices.
