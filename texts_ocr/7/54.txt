The Despar Tribu App also underwent significant changes during the year. It has turned into a true
edutainment tool, entertaining customers with games while informing them about local products, ini
tiatives, events, and topics associated with sustainability and protecting the environment. An update
has allowed to automate coupons, making them easier to use for customers—which include 384,953
registered users in 2019. Customers can be reached quickly and directly through the app’s notifications,
which provide information on available games as well as news about, and any recalls of, our products,
making customers more loyal and bringing them closer to the Company.
