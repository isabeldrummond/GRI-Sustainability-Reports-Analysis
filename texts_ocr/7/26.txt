Inventory turnover ratios: show how
often inventories are restocked through-

out the year. They are calculated by
considering average inventory levels and
average outflows by warehouse.

 

With respect to warehouse handling, ECR GS1 (Efficient
consumer response - Global standard) experts contin-
ued providing training on pallet handling and safety:
the goal is to define a single certifiable standard. For
fruit and vegetable products as well as others, we use
100% reusable plastic crates as a partial replacement
for conventional one-way cardboard, wood and plas-
tic packaging. Reusable crates ensure higher quality,
fresher and more hygienic products as well as reduced
waste, and their use is being extended to more and
more product categories. In 2019, the Company used
13,914,475 reusable crates.

The synergy between the various deliveries—which in
some cases are made just in time—and the appropri-
ate technologies implemented allow to restock shelves
at a low cost and reduce inventories, striking a balance
between expiration dates, customer demands, and
promotional trends. Products are withdrawn a few
days before they expire in order to be recovered and
donated to local charitable organisations helping peo-
ple in need.
