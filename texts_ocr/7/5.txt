About this report

ABOUT THIS REPORT

The Integrated Report is the information tool intended
to illustrate how the Company creates value in the
short, medium, and long term in the context it oper-
ates in. The Integrated Report allows representing,
assessing, and monitoring in a consistent manner the
actions, resources—including intangible ones—and
results that are crucial to the Company.

INTEGRATED REPORT: WHY?

The Integrated Report tells how the Company creates
value from the resources it uses and reinvests. The deci-
sion to prepare an Integrated Report allows to show
the identity and results of Aspiag Service through the
six capitals, underlining the connections and resources
relevant to the Company’s strategic decisions.

PRESENTATION

The CFO leads the preparation of the Integrated
Report and presents it to the Board of Directors on
the occasion of the approval of the Annual Financial
Statements.

REFERENCES

The <IR> Framework of IIRC is the reference document
for the Integrated Report. The sustainability indicators
disclosed in this Report are reported according to the
GRI Standards under the “in accordance-Core option”:
they are marked with an icon on the side of the body
text. The interactive links to websites are highlighted in
green, and the terms marked with a * are illustrated in
the glossary at the bottom of the page.

ration of the Report, please see the Methodological
Notes (p. 80).

Our Integrated Report is not just a reporting tool, but
rather a process capable of affecting other processes
and decisions during its preparation as well as after its
release: in combination with other resources, it allows
the Company to coordinate its internal units, refine the
method used to report the value it creates, and convey
information to make decisions.
