Change in average daily consumption -1.45% 0.78% -5.85%

Note: the consumption shown was calculated on a like-for-like basis over the 3-year reporting period. Since the basis is not
homogeneous from one year to the next, the data for previous years differ from those presented in previous Reports.

Emissions

Our stores are rated AZ or A4. Aspiag Service is reducing emissions through several innovations that concern the
entire store. Heating and air conditioning units at the stores are always set based on outdoor temperatures. By
recovering cooking fumes, it is possible to heat up the air intake from outside and use less energy for heating pur-
poses. The heat generated by refrigeration systems is also recycled to heat up water for sanitary purposes as well as
for space heating. The refrigeration systems use low-impact refrigerant fluids, and the oldest systems are replaced
with new CO,-based ones. The data on indirect emissions (Scope 2) is reported by using two different methods.
The Location Based method reflects the amount of emissions generated specifically where energy is consumed.
This is multiplied by a conversion rate (Terna, last updated in 2017) that considers the country’s total energy mix,
accounting for both fossil and renewable energy volumes fed into Italy's grid in a given year.

The Market Based method measures how virtuous the company’s energy policy is through the purchases of
Guarantees of Origin. In this case, emissions are calculated by multiplying the energy use, less the amount of
Guarantees of Origin, by the Residual Mix factor provided by the AIB (Association of Issuing Bodies). As certified
green energy accounted for 84% of the total in 2019, emissions saw a 77% decline in real terms (ratio of 64,097 tonnes
of CO, eq. to the remaining 14,526 tonnes of CO, eq. net of the green energy purchased).
