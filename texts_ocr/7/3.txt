ASPIAG SERVICE « 2019 INTEGRATED REPORT

Dear Sir

and Madam

the work carried out in 2019 and the results we will dis-
cuss in this Integrated Report are the fruit of the com-
mitment and passion that Despar’s employees have
showed every day in the past year. | am writing this
at the end of 2019, as the leitmotiv that will guide us
and identify our brand in 2020 and beyond is already
apparent: the value of choice.

Every day, we take decisions that make our Company
not only successful, but also valuable, as the results we
are presenting to you show.

Once again in 2019, we decided to stay close to our
community through our CSR operations, as part of
which the value and dedication of Despar’s men and
women come to life. Our stores thus turn into venues
of aid and solidarity. We saw this during emergencies,
as a high tide swept through Venice in November 2019:
the generosity of our customers and the dedication of
Despar’s men and women allowed to raise €70,000 in
donations for the city in just a few days. Our choices
of value and the value of our choices: we see them in
our fund-raising efforts, through which we support all
those associations that represent a key asset in our 4
regions. By deciding to help them, we as a Company
become a reference for communities.

At Despar, choosing proximity and inclusion means
supporting also several entities and initiatives through
sponsorships, helping them increase the already price-
less value they add to the local community. Proximity
and inclusion: these key words are reflected in our
“tribe”, which is becoming bigger and bigger as well as
more and more vibrant with ideas, people, and projects.

The emphasis Despar’s employees place on sustain-
ability has allowed us to make improvements with
respect to the ISO 14001 certification, making our pro-
cesses increasingly more robust and effective. Our
decision of being a sustainable Company translates
into using plastics responsibly. This year, we introduced
the use of water bottles, environmentally-friendly
glasses, and micro-filtered water dispensers among
our employees—simple everyday gestures that allow
to achieve broader goals.

We want to maintain a high-quality presence in each
of the communities we serve. We have done this while
opening 21 new stores (8 direct stores and 13 franchise
stores), expanding yet again in Emilia Romagna with
a ground-breaking Interspar format, and inaugurat-
ing the magnificent Despar in Padua’s Prato della
Valle—an example of renovation that allows people
to do their groceries while breathing art and history.
Aspiag Service added not only new stores, but also
new employees: in 2019 the headcount rose yet again
to 8,236 employees, who represent Despar’s true
strength.

The value of choice: the decisions we have made in
nearly 60 years, be they small or big, right or wrong,
have made us who we are. They have turned us into an
increasingly recognised and recognisable Company
when it comes to our operations as well as each of
our people—those who choose to grow together and
make themselves invaluable to Despar through their
work every day.
