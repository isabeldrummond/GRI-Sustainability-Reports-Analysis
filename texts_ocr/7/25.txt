ASPIAG SERVICE + 2019 INTEGRATED REPORT

Logistics

Logistics flows of goods are optimised and subject
to controls in each stage of the distribution process,
ensuring daily freshness and product safety as well as
steady supply to the retail stores. As a case in point,
in 2019 the Group made 231,327 deliveries with 83,595
distribution trips. To transport our products, we use a
fleet of Euro 5 and 6 vehicles equipped with the tech-
nology required to store the various items at the right
temperature and optimise loads at all times. Aspiag
Service can rely on 9 platforms—including 4 Ce.Di.—
across the areas it serves that help streamline trans-
portation. The Ce.Di. in Mestrino (province of Padua) is
the management and administrative centre for all the
group's business activities and the operational base for
Veneto. Bolzano’s Ce.Di. is the registered office of the
Company and manages the Trentino-Alto Adige com-
mercial activities. Udine’s Ce.Di. oversees commercial
operations in Friuli Venezia Giulia; in 2019, it renovated
its cold storage facilities for fresh produce to boost effi-
ciency and the quality of the items handled.

The Ce.Di. in Castel San Pietro Terme (province of
Bologna) became operational in 2019 to serve the
Emilia Romagna region. Each Distribution Centre also
features a logistics platform for grocery products.
