Future outlook

Global trade lost momentum during the year and is projected to expand slowly over

the medium term.

The current weakness in international trade, especially
when it comes to manufacturing, and the mounting
uncertainty over recurring trade and political tensions
continue weighing on global economic growth, hold-
ing back investments (source: ECB). The situation is
made even tougher by the risks Coronavirus poses
at a global level to both healthcare systems and the
economy as well as the escalating conflict between
the US and Iran: the relevant impacts on oil prices
and global trade are yet to be fully appreciated. Some
respite comes from more clarity over Brexit and the
easing of trade disputes between the United States
and China (source: Istat).

The latest data point to slow global growth, which
will continue being supported by favourable finan-
cial conditions, rising employment, and the slightly
expansive fiscal policy of the euro area (source: Bank
of Italy), whose goal is to mitigate the downcycle and
firmly address structural issues such as the lack of
public investments, climate change, and social ten-
sions. In Italy, policy actions are aligned with European
ones and aim to boost domestic demand through
public investments while striving to reduce the debt/
GDP ratio: GDP growth is estimated at +0.4% in 2020
(source: 2019 Economic and Financial Document).
Against this backdrop, the retail industry is showing

positive growth (+0.8% compared to 2018) thanks to
the strong performance in the South (+0.9% com-
pared to -0.6% in 2018) and the growth of the discount
channel as well as structured groups. This comes at
the expense of small merchants, who are struggling
in the face of price competition.

Declining margins and the problems experienced by
certain players represent opportunities for others. In
2020, large scale distribution is expected to grow by
+1.4% compared to 2019 (source: Nielsen based on Iri
data), without considering the boost from the e-com-
merce channel: in 2019 online food purchases were up
+26% relative to 2018, accounting for approximately
2.5% of total grocery shopping, and are likely to con-
tinue rising in 2020 with an additional +30%.

With respect to current trends, prices could poten-
tially rise (+1%), following the approximately 0.5%
increase seen in 2019, and more shopping could hap-
pen at modern retailers rather than conventional
small ones. In 2020, the sales network will expand in
terms of square footage mostly in the discount and
supermarket segments, whereas hypermarkets will
continue shrinking (-0.9% at the end of 2019).
