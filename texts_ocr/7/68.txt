Waste

We strive to curb, recover, and recycle waste and packaging, as well as to dispose any hazardous waste. These opera-
tions reflect also the expenses incurred to protect the environment, including waste disposal costs, waste collection
fees, and land reclamation costs, which involve rehabilitating areas polluted by third parties and go hand in hand
with the development of new stores.

Note: Aspiag Service manages the collection of sorted waste at all retail stores. This is mainly for paper, cardboard, plastic, wood
or glass packaging, mixed packaging, hazardous waste, F.O.R.S.U. (Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste) and R.S.U. (Unsorted
Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste). Since sorted waste is collected by municipal companies that do not measure the production of
each user but only the total quantity collected, data on the dry and wet fractions are calculated empirically using:

+ the number of weekly collections;

+ the number of dumpsters/bins in use;

+a filling coefficient of the dumpsters/bins.

In cases where the reference municipalities do not collect certain types of waste, the Company relies on private disposers. For R.S.U.
collection containers (average volume of 1100 |), an average fill weight of 88 kg was assumed; for F.O.R.S.U. collection bins (average
volume of 240 |), an average fill weight of 120 kg was assumed.

Method of disposal:

Items referred to in points 1) and 2) public service waste collection - composting; landfillAvaste-to-energy plant. Item referred to in
point 3), 4) authorised private disposal companies - composting - recycling.

Item 4 covers polyethylene, wood, glass, iron and steel, waste vegetable oil, materials unsuitable for consumption or processing and
animal by-products.

Supply Chain

We promote the respect and protection of the environment throughout the supply chain, and incorporate environ-
mental guidelines into supplier screening procedures. During 2019, the Company audited certain suppliers of private
label products marketed by Aspiag Service to ensure their compliance with environmental laws and launch a pro-
cess to promote best practices throughout the supply chain.
