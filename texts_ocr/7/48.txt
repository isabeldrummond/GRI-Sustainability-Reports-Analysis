Some of the most significant new openings of 2019 were the Despar store in Trieste’s Piazza dell’Unita d'Italia
and the one in Padua’s Prato della Valle. These stores are in two of the world’s most striking locations and
stand out for the quality of the architectural heritage that was restored.

Despar in Trieste’s Piazza dell’Unita d'Italia

Even though it is very small, this Despar not only offers a large number of products, but also retains the ele-
gance of the store, as it was specifically designed to be welcoming and pleasant, but not chaotic. The new
store faces the square and was restored without any invasive work, so as not to alter the appearance and flow
of the location.

Despar in Padua’s Prato della Valle

The new Despar in Padua’s Prato della Valle sits inside Padua's former Foro Boario, which was restored and
renovated thanks to a series of interventions and new openings. Our store stands out for its extremely peculiar
structure and a layout that is fitting of the historic setting. Two large glass windows constantly bring in natural
light and give a view of the spectacular square. The indoor space is modern and elegant: the nearly 500 sq.m
surface area houses 7,000 items and 25 employees, nearly all of them new hires.
