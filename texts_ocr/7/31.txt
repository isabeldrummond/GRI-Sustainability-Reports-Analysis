ASPIAG SERVICE « 2019 INTEGRATED REPORT

Risks and opportunities

While carrying out our activities we are exposed to
both the risks associated with the external macro-
economic system and the risks arising from strategic
choices within the Company, which can affect the
creation of value over time. The directors, assisted
by the Supervisory Body and the Internal Audit and
Protection of Corporate Assets departments, monitor
the risk factors in order to identify and prevent events
that may adversely affect the corporate business.

For each type of risk, the likelinood of occurrence of
the event and, once taken the necessary measures to

mitigate it, the potential impact on value creation for
the Company, have been identified (matrix on page 31).
The following table shows, for each risk class, the
stakeholders concerned, the measures taken to mit-
igate each risk, and the indicators used to measure
them. We not only manage risks, but also seize the
opportunities that may arise from external or inter-
nal factors and can be key to our growth (promoting
healthy lifestyles, short supply chains, e-commerce,
raising awareness on environmental issues, expanding
into new areas, etc.).
