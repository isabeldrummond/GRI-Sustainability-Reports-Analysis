ASPIAG SERVICE « 2019 INTEGRATED REPORT

WELFARE AND CORPORATE DIVERSITY

Aspiag Service strives to create the best possible work-
ing conditions, putting itself on the line to achieve the
8.8 and 8.5 targets of the SDGs by providing equal
opportunities for all categories of employees as well
as full and productive employment. It does so by pay-
ing the same basic salaries to men and women as well
as promoting work-life balance by offering part-time
work. The Work-Life Balance helps employees get
back to work, including at the end of their parental
leave, with more than 90% of employees coming back
once their leave has ended. This proportion slightly
declines 12 months later.

Aspiag Service promotes and takes responsibility for
the well-being of all its employees through the Health
Project, which seeks to raise awareness about the
benefits of the contractual health insurance policy
by encouraging check-ups, specialist examinations,
medical treatments, and maternity leaves. The num-
ber of special agreements with healthcare providers
has increased, and in 2019 the project was expanded
to include franchisees. In addition, 2019 saw the com-

® Diversity and Welfare

pletion of the “Caregiving” project for all the stores in
the provinces of Padua and Vicenza. It aims to raise
awareness about existing tools to care for children and
disabled relatives on the one hand, and on the other
hand, to develop organisational approaches in order to
properly support the employees concerned.

The Company gave information booklets to employ-
ees and held meetings with experts in caring for chil-
dren, the elderly and the disabled. It also designed a
management course for store managers on how to
handle employees that need to care for such individu-
als at home. The project was mapped 12 months later
through surveys to monitor the results achieved over
time. The Company's workforce is also very diverse.
21% of employees are under 30; 54% between 30 and
50, and the remaining 25% over 50 years old. When
onboarding new employees, we promote the inte-
gration of disabled or disadvantaged individuals into
the workplace in collaboration with Employment
Integration Services.
