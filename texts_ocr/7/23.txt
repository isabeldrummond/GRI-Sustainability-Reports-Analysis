ASPIAG SERVICE « 2019 INTEGRATED REPORT

Business model

Our Business Model encompasses the various phases of the distribution system,
relationships with stakeholders, as well as the relevant risks and opportunities.

Aspiag Service manages supermarkets with a purely
food-based vocation and purchases fast-moving con-
sumer goods (both branded and non-branded prod-
ucts) from suppliers to resell them at its stores and to
franchisees. To provide the utmost value to custom-
ers, we work with diversified suppliers that meet high
quality standards.

Supply chain

Aspiag Service maintains its market position also
thanks to the sound management of the supply chain,
which encompasses all phases—from the selection
of suppliers to procurement, and from distribution
to retail sales—allowing the Company to effectively
achieve its own goals as well as those of stakeholders.

Purchases

 

Suppliers are selected according to a customer-ori-
ented approach, pursuing quality products, competi-
tive prices and transparency in relationships.

Procurement management is supported by processes
that help sharing information between the Company
and the supplier, which streamline the flow between
purchase orders and delivery of products to the retail
store. To take advantage of reduced waiting times,
greater programmability of supplies and delivery dis-
counts, we concentrate purchases by means of ESD
Italia, a central purchasing* and marketing group
which negotiates supply contracts with domestic con-
sumer goods industries on behalf of its shareholders.
At Aspiag Service, we offer the items on sale in catego-
ries that consumers perceive as correlated or replace-
able.Categories are managed by category managers

The balanced and efficient operation of Governance
bodies and the distribution system drives the
Company's mission, balancing the expectations of
shareholders and the other Stakeholders, the planning
and fulfilment of strategic goals, Stakeholder mon-
itoring, the maximisation of opportunities, and risk
mitigation.

The supply chain generates synergies between the
Company's employees and suppliers, curbs costs,
reduces environmental impacts, and offers customers
guarantees with respect to the quality of the process-
ing and transportation of products.

as a profit centre from the bargaining phase to shelf
allocation, maximising the performance and margin of
the items. In 2019 the new Quality Department became
operational. It audits suppliers and platforms as well
as assesses compliance with regulatory requirements
concerning manufacturing and the quality of products
and deliveries received from suppliers. Audits at retail
stores are carried out by the Food Safety function. The
Quality Control function analysed 176 fruit and vege-
tables items during 2019. Compliance audits for the
sale of organic products in bulk were also carried out
directly at the platform level by the certification body.
This year, at the Top Fresh Retailer awards hosted by
Fruitbook Magazine, Aspiag Service was rated as the
best Group in Italy’s North-east by fruit and vegetable
