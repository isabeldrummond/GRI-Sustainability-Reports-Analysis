40 Workers’ safety representatives (RLS)

The Company's Prevention and Protection Service con-
stantly analyses health and safety hazards, defining
the most appropriate prevention and protection mea-
sures for each one of them (e.g. operating procedures,
refresher training, new or different Personal Protective
Equipment). The findings of such analysis are formally
presented in the Risk Assessment Documents pre-
pared by each individual operating unit.

Each year begins with an analysis of the results
achieved in the previous one, starting with the analy-
sis of injuries and near-miss (including also outsourced
operations), and then of non-compliance cases, regular
audits, and any other information deemed relevant to
occupational health and safety.

In addition, as part of this exercise the Company also
sets goals for improvement, establishing for each one
of them the available financial and organisational
resources as well as the relevant timetable. In 2019

There was only one injury resulting in more than 180
days lost, as in 2018, and no deaths occurred. The occu-
pational disease rate remained in line with the previous
year, and so did the number of suspected occupational
diseases reported.

Every three months, all stores are briefed on the trend
in injuries through statistical data showing the causes,
place of occurrence, frequency, and equipment most
commonly involved in these events.

Throughout the year, the Company conducted specific
audits inside the stores where issues were found, with
the direct support of store managers as well as depart-
ment heads. Occupational health and safety training
is constantly monitored through the company's ERP.
