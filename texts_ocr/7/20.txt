Organisational Model 231/01

Since 2005, Aspiag Service has voluntarily adopted an
Organisation, Management and Control Model pre-
pared in accordance with Italian Legislative Decree
231/2001* and updated pursuant to Italian Law 3/2019
as well as Legislative Decree 124/2019, which intro-
duced the criminal offences of illicit traffic of influ-
ence and fraudulent billing. The Model encompasses
the Supervisory Body, the Code of Ethics, the Internal
Regulations and Mapping of Powers, the Protocol
Manual and the Penalty System, which represent risk

management tools. The Model, especially as far as the
Code of Ethics is concerned, has paved the way for
the best practices that the Company has been imple-
menting for some time now, and goes towards the
UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which
Aspiag Service uses as a reference (see page 33). At 31
December 2019, as in the previous two years, no law-
suits or other types of proceedings concerning anti-
competitive practices or antitrust or monopoly viola-
tions had been initiated against the Company.

THE SUPERVISORY BODY - COMPLIANCE OFFICE

The Compliance Office acts as Supervisory Body, regulating corporate liability for unlawful administrative acts
connected with offences. The Body is composed of an internal and external member pursuant to Italian Legislative
Decree 2317/01 and is appointed by the Board of Directors every two years. The Compliance Officer oversees the
operation and effectiveness of, as well as compliance with, the Model. The C.O. shall also adjust the Model accord-
ing to the Company's operations and potential regulatory changes, reporting any problems on a regular basis,
making preparations for the annual audits, and training employees on the Model. 84 employees received training
in 2019. With respect to updates or crime prevention efforts, the C.O. may perform risk assessments for individual
areas or operations at risk.

Aspiag Service’s employees can report any criminal offences or request information through the specific e-mail
address of the Supervisory Body: co_aspiagservice@despar.it.

CODE OF ETHICS www.despar.it/it/node/17/codice-etico/

The Code of Ethics sets out the rights, duties and responsibilities of any party, establishing the principles of trans-
parency, fairness, protection of Shareholders and creditors, and the professional ethics of Aspiag Service, which
guide the Company as well as represent contractual prerequisites for working or dealing with Aspiag Service.
Compliance with the Code of Ethics by all parties (Directors, Legal Representatives, employees, Auditors, suppliers,
etc.) ensures the regularity of Company operations, as well as prevents any irregularities and conflicts of interests.
In line with the principles set out in the Code of Ethics, the Company does not offer direct or indirect contribu-
tions, in any whatsoever form, to parties, movements, political and trade union organisations and committees,
their members and candidates, unless permitted by specific regulations and in compliance with the principle of
transparency.

INTERNAL REGULATIONS AND MAPPING OF POWERS

The Internal Regulations and Mapping of Powers govern the operations of the bodies vested with powers of man-
agement and representation. They are distributed to new hires and made available through all company bulletin
boards as well as the portal.

PROTOCOL MANUAL

The Protocol Manual plans the Company's decision-making process regarding activities that involve the potential
risk of unlawful acts and monitors, under the supervision of the Compliance Office, the various functions in charge
of sensitive activities.

PENALTY SYSTEM

The Penalty System monitors compliance with the Model, procedures and conduct. The violation of the obliga-
tions described therein always constitutes a violation of terms of contract and disciplinary offence from which the
Company does not intend to pursue any advantage.

Italian Legislative Decree 231/01: Legislative Decree of 8 June 2001 introduced a system of administrative liability
for companies, that is actually a system of criminal liability, for crimes against the Public Administration (corruption,
bribery, etc.) or corporate crimes (e.g., false accounting) committed by employees, executives or directors in the
interest or for the benefit of their companies.
