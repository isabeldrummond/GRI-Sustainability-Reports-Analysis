The core of the organisation is its business model, which leverages capitals (inputs) to convert them into outputs
through business operations. Business operations and the relevant impacts in turn affect the capitals. The 2018
outputs serve as the inputs for 2019. The chart does not show all indicators, but rather only some of those discussed
in the section on “Performances”.
