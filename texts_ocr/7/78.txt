In 2020 the Company will remain committed to
the environment and the local community. The
ISO 14001 certification, which covered 43 stores
and 2 offices as at 31st December 2019, will be
expanded to include 3 additional stores, and the
environmental policy will be extended through-
out the supply chain. The Company will make fur-
ther progress on packaging, which will increas-
ingly meet sustainability-related needs starting
with private label products.

In 2020 Aspiag Service will focus its resources
on researching packing materials, shoppers,
and containers to find solutions more and more
aligned with reducing the use of plastics. In this
regard, in 2020 single-use plastic products will
start being replaced with items made from recy-
cled materials.

The Company will also continue pursuing initia-
tives to support the community in parallel to its
growth efforts.

WHAT WE WILL DO +» ANNEXES

In 2019 the Company carried on with the SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference) project on the
efficiency of the supply chain with the goal of aligning metrics, processes, and KPIs. This interna-
tional standard is being gradually implemented by a cross-functional working group that involves the
Procurement, Logistics, and BPM departments. 2019 saw the implementation of an analytics project to
monitor the quality and quantity of deliveries at the grocery product warehouse in Mestrino (province
of Padua) using a standard and shared metric.
