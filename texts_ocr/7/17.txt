Governance

the corporate governance system—aligned with both national and international

best practices—is constantly strengthened in order to manage the complexity of the
situations in which the Company operates and the challenges to be faced to implement
a clear and sustainable development strategy.

Shareholders’ Meeting and Board of Directors

The Shareholders’ Meeting, chaired by the Chair of
the Board of Directors (Board) or by another person
appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting itself by a
simple majority, heads the governance structure.

The Board carries out its duties for both the ordinary and
extraordinary management according to the law, the
Company's Articles of Association and Organisational
Model 237/01. Appointing several Managing Directors

has not increased the cost of the corporate structure,
given that the Directors receive no payment for the
role they hold. The Board approves and supervises the
economic and financial planning of business opera-
tions through the Management Committee.

In order to facilitate relations with local institutions and
new areas of development, the Board meets in differ-
ent locations in our trading area.

Board of Statutory Auditors and Independent Auditor

The Shareholders appoint the Board of Statutory
Auditors and the Independent Auditor with the role
of supervising the Company's operation and its struc-
ture. The Board of Statutory Auditors, as well as having
management control functions, has a term of office
of three financial years and supervises compliance
with the law, the Company’s Articles of Association
and the correctness of the management methods
adopted, with particular focus on the organisational,
management and accounting structure. With regard
to accounting control, Aspiag Service appointed EY
S.p.A. as independent auditor, also with a term of
three financial years expiring with the approval of the
2021 financial statements.
