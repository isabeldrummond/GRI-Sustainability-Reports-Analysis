Customers at our stores are satisfied with the service and products offered. Specifically, they appreciate the clean-
liness of the store, the availability of staff members, the ease of access to the store, and the quality of fresh produce.
The company has consolidated its image and increasingly receives positive feedback.

End consumers can rely on a series of strict security protocols that Aspiag Service has put in place with respect to
privacy. In 2019, as in the previous two years, these allowed to prevent any customer data breaches. ®

2019 saw a change in the way we communicate with customers in the store, as we increasingly rely on
monitors and led walls. The monitors, which are mounted either vertically or horizontally and come in
different sizes, are installed in the aisles and departments to dynamically provide messages on promo-
tions, magazines, the environment, private label products, the Despar Tribu App, and much more. This
allows to engage and inform customers, employees, and even those who pass by the store in real time.
