PRIVATE LABEL PRODUCTS

The private label products, managed in collaboration
with Despar Italia, are products of third-party compa-
nies that are sold under the Despar brand. Private label
products compete on quality with branded goods and
come in different lines or brands. In addition, they place
special emphasis on sustainability, coming in a simple
and effective packaging—including for disposal pur-
poses—and are based on increasingly healthy recipes
(with a gradually lower salt and sugar content, in line
with the sustainability projects promoted by the entire
Group). Our private label offerings include all product
categories created exclusively for Despar by the best
producers on the market. They account for 24.6% of
turnover. In 2019, the Group finalised a check-list for
private label product suppliers in order to promote
and monitor their environmental sustainability strat-
egies. Said check-list is now annexed to contractual
agreements. In 2019, the Group conducted 38 audits of
private label product suppliers, inspecting 530 private
label items and 947 labels.

CENTRO CARNI - THE MEAT CENTRE

In 2019, Aspiag Service brought all the functions
of Bolzano's Centro Carni Superdistribuzione S.r.l.
in-house through a merger. As a result, Aspiag Service
took responsibility for the production and handling
of fresh meat at all direct stores and several franchise
stores as well as in the countries where the SPAR brand
has a presence. By centralising the processing of red
meat and cured meats, Aspiag Service can ensure
high quality standards in terms of natural and safe food
products. The label of all products features a tracking

The value of private label products

Private label products have always been the best way to convey values to our customers, such as
quality, convenience, innovation and attention to the environment and health. These values are exem-
plified by the “Friend of the sea” and “Dolphin Safe” labels on the canned tuna line and the increas-
ingly lower salt and sugar content in our recipes, showing our focus on procurement methods and the

 
 
  

    
 

number that allows to trace their lifecycle, including
information on the birth of the animal and its diet. The
meat production phases and the Production Centre
are ISO 22000 and OHSAS 18001 certified, respectively.
The products on offer go hand in hand with consumer
trends, replacing potentially allergenic ingredients
with safer ones and promoting organic, sustainable
and local food production. The entire supply chain of
the main meat categories is audited and sold under
the Passo dopo Passo brand.

SS re dopo Passo” supply chain

The “Passo dopo Passo” supply chain is a control programme which informs about the origin of meat,
fish, fruit and vegetables thanks to the traceability of the production chain. The stamp on the product
guarantees food safety and quality through controls from production to sale.
