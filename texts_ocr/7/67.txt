Electricity - market based 13,483 6,356 -
Heat from district heating 1,043 1141 1,199
Total 14,526 7,497 1,199

 

Note: all the values in the table are expressed in tonnes of CO, equivalent, with the exception of emissions from electricity consumption
which are expressed in tonnes of CO,.

The factors used to calculate emissions are taken from the “UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting” tables
published by DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs). As for the 2019 indirect emissions related to the electricity
purchased from Italy's national power grid, we used the emission factor developed by Terna (updated in 2017).

@ Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions - scope 3 (t of CO2 eq.) | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 |

 

Indirect (Scope 3) emissions related to logistics’ transport 14,678 14,896 14,203

 

Note: the Scope 3 CO, equivalent emissions deriving from outbound logistics (freight transport from distribution centres to retail
stores) were calculated using the number of km travelled by each vehicle as the primary data and using the emission factors expressed
in kg of CO, equivalent per km as indicated in the “UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting” tables published
by DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs). The choice of conversion factor depended on the type of vehicle
(articulated, rigid) and weight (> 3.5 - 7.5 tonnes, > 7.5 tonnes - 17 tonnes, >17 tonnes), and considered an average load per vehicle.
