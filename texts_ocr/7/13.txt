1930s

Aspiag Service's history began in 1932, when Adriaan van Well set up SPAR International in the Netherlands
by bringing together retailers and wholesalers. The company still manages the brand internationally to this
day. The name “Despar” is the acronym of a Dutch saying: “Everyone benefits equally from harmonious
cooperation”.

1950s

The “Despar” brand was shortened to “Spar”"—“fir” in Dutch—and spread throughout the world. 1n 1954,
Hans F. Reisch set up the first SPAR organisation in Austria (Handelsvereinigung SPAR Tirol/Pinzgau),
which in 1970 will become today's SPAR Austria (SPAR Osterreichische Warenhandels AG).

1960s

During the 1960s, Spar International was looking for partners in Italy. The following entities were
set up in the country's north-east between 1959 and 1961: Padis S.p.A. in Mestrino (province of
Padua), Scambi Commerciali S.r.l. in Friuli Venezia Giulia, and Amonn Service S.r.l. in Bolzano.
After two years of franchising, Spar Centrale Italiana was born in 1962, bringing back the original
“Despar” brand. In 1968 it turned into Consorzio Despar Italia.

1989 - 2000

In 1989, through Aspiag Management AG, the Spar Austria Group founded today’s Aspiag Service,

taking over the companies operating under the Despar brand in the Triveneto area and turning
them into offices and Distribution Centres (Ce.Di. - Centri Distributivi - in Bolzano, Mestrino, and
Udine). Starting in the 1990s and throughout the 2000s, Aspiag Service expanded through acqui-
sitions and expansions, bringing together international and local entities.

2000 - 2018

Since 2010 it has obtained major certifications: OHSAS 18001 in 2010, ISO 14001 in 2013 (first Large
Scale Distribution company). Business has grown rapidly in Emilia Romagna over the last few years.

2019

This year, net sales totalled €1.909 billion, with 241 stores and 8,236 employees. In 2019 the Company
Superdistribuzione S.r.l. was wholly acquired and merged into Aspiag Service.
