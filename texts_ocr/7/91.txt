Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that
the GRI disclosure of the Integrated Report of Aspiag Service S.r.I. for the year ended on December 31,
2019 has not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the requirements of the GRI
Standards, as described in the paragraph “Methodological Notes” of the Integrated Report 2019.
