SALES IN ITALY’S MODERN
RETAIL INDUSTRY
(source: Istat)

In 2019, the euro area's growth was estimated at +1.2%
(source: ECB) and saw a slowdown in the first half of
the year due to international trade tensions as well as
Brexit-related developments. Markets subsequently
stabilised, which had a positive impact on the fourth
quarter of the year.

Italy's GDP rose by 0.2% (source: Istat), weighed down
by political instability. With respect to domestic eco-
nomic activity, domestic demand showed feeble
growth, businesses significantly reduced their inven-
tories, and international trade made a positive con-
tribution. Against this backdrop, retail sales were up
0.8% year-on-year in terms of both value and volume
(source: Istat). This was driven by the diversified local
nature of retail operations (source: Istat). Italy’s south-
ern regions made a difference in 2019 following the
modernisation of distribution channels and the mea-
sures taken by recent Governments to support house-
hold incomes.

Large retailers reported +1.4% growth compared

to 2018, whereas their smaller counterparts faced
increased competitive pressures and were down 0.7%
year-on-year. Among large retailers, the best perform-
ers were discount stores (+4.5%), followed by non-food
stores (+1.8%) and supermarkets (+0.8%), whereas
hypermarkets continued declining with a 0.9% con-
traction compared to 2018 (source: Istat).

In 2019, the market still comprised several regional
entities and franchise chains, resulting in high local
saturation (source: Mediobanca).

However, Nielsen believes that business combinations
are not enough to win in the marketplace and that
the focus should be on the store as an innovative and
distinguishing feature of the brand, with offerings tai-
lored to consumer needs.

Recent food trends continued, but they are not the
only issue market players have to deal with: new tech-
nologies, environmental and social sustainability, and
multichannel retailing represent other current chal-
lenges that they must address.
