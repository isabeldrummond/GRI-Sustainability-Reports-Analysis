Starting from 2020, Aspiag Service will reposition
the brand according to a new strategy, in line with
the celebration of Despar Italia's 60-year anniversary.
This will involve a communication campaign on tele-
vision as well as digital and paper media. The cele-
brations will promote private label products and the
brand through travelling initiatives inside the truck
together with employees and franchisees, strength-
ening the identity and values of the Despar brand. The
Despar TribU App will also constantly evolve through
smart updates, expanding to include franchisees and
offering heart points for select product categories

After listening to employees, Aspiag Service will intro-
duce a number of innovations in 2020: it will begin
using the truck for recruiting purposes, turning it into
an additional venue for interviews in all regions. As for
store employees, inventory management processes
will speed up thanks to scales offering new function-
alities, while meter reading and the monitoring of
rejected products will be streamlined by extending the
functions of the PDAs. With respect to Occupational
Safety, the Company has activated a project to raise
awareness among employees about how to properly
handle loads manually. At each physical examination,
the Occupational Physician will give employees an
information booklet summarising and explaining the
procedures concerned.

To increasingly meet customer needs, employees will
participate in new training initiatives, such as those
concerning the delicatessen department as well as
the preparation of products together with chefs.

As for Despar’s private label products, 2020 will see
the revamp of the Verde Vera and Gemma Verde lines
as well as the addition of Enjoy as part of a strategy to
increase the share of turnover generated from private
label products.

In this sense, the Company will introduce a greater
number of items within growing market lines or in
product categories that are still lagging behind, as
well as improve its promotional efforts.

An additional 23 Semi-automated Defibrillators were
recently delivered, allowing to cover the Interspar
channel.

The main goal for 2020 is to transition the Occupational
Safety Management System implemented across all
operating units from the OHSAS 18001 scheme to the
new UNI EN ISO 45001 standard.

This transition will facilitate its integration with the UNI
EN ISO 14001 environmental certification scheme in
the future.

The staff management function will identify the best
organisational solutions to meet the needs of employ-
ees and branches, promote work-life balance, and
promote a positive working environment focused on
delivering the best possible service to customers.
