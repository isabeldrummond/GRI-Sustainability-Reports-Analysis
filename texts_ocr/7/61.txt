ASPIAG SERVICE « 2019 INTEGRATED REPORT

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

Aspiag Service offers several training, specialisation
and refresher courses to create a shared organisa-
tional culture, help employees grow professionally,
build a robust internal know-how, and, most impor-
tantly, align itself with customer needs. Employee
Training and Development offices work in synergy
towards these goals. The former provides workplace
safety training, the courses reserved for the employ-
ees of the various offices, and customer service train-
ing—including through e-learning platforms*, which
speed up learning times and methods as well as min-
imise the impact on operations. Both employees and
new hires are required to complete a substantial
number of hours of classroom training spe-
cific to the Company's business activities.

In 2019, to improve customer relations,
training was provided for the butcher's
departments at the counter served,
aimed at training the employee on
product characteristics, practices to

be adopted and more. Regarding the
management, the activities directly
involved store managers, vice store man-

e-learning hours

agers, and other technical roles. More than half of train-
ing activities are optional. Nearly a third of the training
provided concerns occupational safety. In addition, the
Company also holds courses on food and environmen-
tal safety. In 2019, following the increased spending
on training, the Company was able to benefit more
from external contributions and lower the average
training cost per employee. The Development office is
responsible for employee development projects, such
as those promoting the Company's values, the struc-
turing of Job Descriptions* for management positions,
and the Trainee Store Manager project.
In 2019 the Company conducted its regular corpo-
rate climate survey, and Company provided
training to butcher counter staff to better
inform them on the characteristics of
the products, the practices they should
adopt, and more. With respect to
management, training, the number of
respondents rose by 10% compared to
the previous edition. The findings were
shared with employees and their manag-
ers to identify future improvements.

The Trainee Store Manager project is a 960-hour training programme, both in the classroom and at retail
stores, whose aim is to train future store managers. After obtaining the title of Trainee Store Manager,

the programme provides a stage of operational support and a stage of work in intermediate roles. At the
end of these, the selected trainees will be given the opportunity to become Store Managers.
