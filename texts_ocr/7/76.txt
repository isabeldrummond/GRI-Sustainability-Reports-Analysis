Our strategy is supported by the constant increase in
turnover and retail sales area as well as the improved
efficiency of our cost structure. The solidity of the
European network we are part of is a further guaran-
tee for our future and will help us face our commit-
ments in the coming years. We will continue investing

OVOOOO®

to bolster our market presence, focusing especially on
the medium and long term, and renovating existing
stores in the regions we already serve. In this regard,
thanks to our consolidated sustainability strategy,
starting from 2020 we will be able to enter into a green
loan agreement at a discounted rate.

Note: sales forecasts are considered to be reliable based on the time span necessary for one-year investments to generate net sales,
due to the long administrative time required for new stores to start operating. The EBTDA and investment results outlined here are

linked to the achievement of company revenue targets.

Aspiag Service will continue seizing opportunities to
expand, even though its presence is already wide-
spread in the Triveneto area and growing in Emilia
Romagna, through new openings as well as improve-
ments, renovations, and acquisitions.

One of the main growth projects consists in extending
the new Interspar format introduced with the store
in Carpi: the rollout is set to continue with the one

OVOO®

in Casier (province of Treviso). In 2020, the Company
plans to open 7 stores in the Triveneto regions as well
as in Emilia Romagna, focusing especially on smaller
towns and the rehabilitation of degraded sites—
including the area of the former Maddalena in Trieste,
where the abandoned psychiatric hospital will be
replaced by a Eurospar.
