ASPIAG SERVICE « 2019 INTEGRATED REPORT

EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT

When a new employee joins the Company, he or she is
immediately engaged in an onboarding process that
involves training on the working environment, the com-
pany’s values/goals, and the organisation and opera-
tions of the relevant department.

The Company monitors and carefully manages each
employee throughout the employment relationship
by striving every day to reconcile the personal needs of
employees with the organisation: the ultimate goal is
to promote a positive working environment focused on
delivering the best possible service to customers. Every
day, Human Resources Management helps branches by
constantly providing support and discussing technical
and regulatory issues to define the most appropriate
organisational solutions through:

prevention activities: preliminary assessments of
organisational decisions in collaboration with the Sales
Area, including in the event of corporate transactions,
internal consulting on how to properly comply with
labour laws, as well as discussions and dialogue with
management at both the individual and group level
(branch, community);

contractual activities: discussions with the Sales
Area to define contracts as well as how to handle
individual cases and prepare appropriate contractual
documents;

training activities: addressing the roles of responsi-
bility for proper staff management.

The focus on staff management, including by engaging
in discussions with social partners, allows to maintain
a healthy relationship with employees and, therefore, a
low level of conflict: 2019 saw a limited number of legal
disputes (7 new lawsuits filed during the year) when
considering the number of employees. This figure is
well below the national average. Meanwhile, there was
a rise in the number of labour disputes settled volun-
tarily (41 out-of-court settlements). One again in 2019,
there were no judicial rulings associated with discrim-

inatory incidents and no cases of corruption, human
rights abuses or discrimination were reported through
the Company's whistleblowing channel. With regard
to significant organisational changes, the law explic-
itly provides for specific Company obligations for trade
union consultation. This is why the Company prefers
maintaining healthy long-term relationships with its
employees, based on trust and cooperation, and there-
fore prioritises permanent contracts. During 2019, tem-
porary contracts accounted for as little as about 10% of
the company’s total workforce— which is completely
normal when considering the new stores opened in
2019 and the resulting increase in the headcount.

Since 1st January 2019, Aspiag Service has been apply-
ing the new collective bargaining agreement for the
Large Scale Distribution industry, entered into by
Federdistribuzione and Trade Unions. It establishes
collective contractual rights, including with respect
to remuneration, and achieves full parity between
men and women also in the workplace. The Company
shares all these values and firmly stands by them also
through its Code of Ethics. In addition, the supple-
mental company-level agreement, which offers better
terms compared to the collective bargaining agree-
ment, still applies. It is divided into four types of con-
tract that are very similar to each other and refer to the
branches in Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions, Friuli
Venezia Giulia, the autonomous province of Trento, and
the autonomous province of Bolzano, respectively. To
reward the dedication of our store employees, these
4 company-level agreements include also a specific
incentive scheme under which all workers receive col-
lective annual bonuses upon the achievement of certain
results in terms of hourly productivity, the reduction in
inventory differences, and the financial performance of
the branch they belong to.

Finally, there is an M.B.O. (Management By Objectives)
scheme for directors and sales managers that is
intended to boost the Company's performance by
aligning individual and corporate goals.
