Building a better
working world

Our work has been performed in accordance with the principle of "International Standard on Assurance
Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) - Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical
Financial Information" (hereinafter "ISAE 3000 Revised"), issued by the International Auditing and
Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. This principle requires the
planning and execution of procedures in order to obtain a limited assurance that the GRI disclosure of
the Integrated Report is free from material misstatements.

Therefore, the extent of work performed in our examination was lower than that required for a full
examination according to the ISAE 3000 Revised ("reasonable assurance engagement") and, hence, it
does not provide assurance that we have become aware of all significant matters and events that would
be identified during a reasonable assurance engagement.

The procedures performed on the GRI disclosure of the Integrated Report were based on our
professional judgment and included inquiries, primarily with the Company's personnel responsible for
the preparation of the information included in the GRI disclosure of the Integrated Report, documents
analysis, recalculations and other procedures in order to obtain evidences considered appropriate.

In particular, we have performed the following procedures:

e analysis of the process relating to the definition of material aspects included in the GRI disclosure of
he Integrated Report, with reference to the criteria applied to identify priorities for the different
stakeholdersâ€™ categories and to the internal validation of the process outcomes;

e comparison of economic and financial data and information included in the GRI disclosure of the
ntegrated Report with those included in the Company's consolidated financial statement;

e understanding of the processes that lead to the generation, detection and management of
significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the GRI disclosure of the Integrated
Report.

n particular, we have conducted interviews and discussions with the management of Aspiag Service
S.r.l. and we have performed limited documentary evidence procedures, in order to collect
information about the processes and procedures that support the collection, aggregation,
processing and transmission of non-financial data and information to the department responsible for
he preparation of the GRI disclosure of the Integrated Report.

 

Furthermore, for significant information, considering the Company's activities and characteristics:

a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the GRI disclosure of the Integrated
Report, we carried out inquiries and acquired supporting documentation to verify its consistency
with the available evidence;

b) with reference to quantitative information, we have performed both analytical procedures and
limited assurance procedures to ascertain on a sample basis the correct aggregation of data.
