Voluntary compliance

Compliance is crucial for companies, especially if they
are large or engage in activities subject to multiple
rules.Besides regulatory compliance, Aspiag Service
has voluntarily put several auditing tools in place to
ensure quality and safety.

The ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 systems as well as

the voluntary food quality audits in accordance with
HACCP* systems characterise the high level of perfor-
mance of the services and products offered. Starting
from 2020, these different systems will be coordi-
nated by a single department responsible for all
Safety-related issues.

HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points): is a protocol aimed at preventing food contamination and is
based on the monitoring of those food processing phases which may entail a biological, chemical or physical hazard.
