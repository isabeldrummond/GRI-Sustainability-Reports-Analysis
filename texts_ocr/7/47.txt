NEW OPENINGS RENOVATIONS.

AND MODERNISATION

For an effective strategy it is essential to maintain
a high level of innovation and development. A big
improvement effort is carried out in the retail stores,
which are the meeting place between the company
and the customers, as well as the major example of our
manufactured capital. The Company sees innovation
as a competitive advantage: for this reason, innovative
proposals from employees as well as from the outside
are developed, since these are considered import-
ant for both the professional growth of everyone and
corporate growth. Our Growth activities, set out in a
Three-Year Growth Plan, pursue this goal through the
Company's expansion or the acquisition of other super-
market chains or individual stores. This involves ana-
lysing and measuring key indicators at the level of the
community and each individual municipality—study-
ing the resident population, tourist flows, and the pur-
chasing power as well as any untapped potential of the
local area, while accounting for the existing sales net-
work (both Despar and the competition) and planned
future openings. Relationships with entrepreneurs, the
public administration, local authorities, brokers, and
others drive the Company's expansion, acquisitions, or
leases as well as the award of real estate construction
contracts.

Another form of growth involves analysing existing
stores to assess whether it is possible to improve their
performance by renovating, expanding or moving
them to a better location. Innovation often involves
renovating historic properties in city centres and his-
torical or cultural landmarks while respecting their

surroundings. Similarly, we renovate urban areas or
former industrial areas to enhance them by opening
new stores.

The spaces inside the stores are revised on a regular
basis and seek to always provide a functional and com-
fortable environment without any obstacles, architec-
tural barriers, and unpleasant architecture. The sales
network continued expanding in 2019 as part of a sus-
tainable strategy that we have been pursuing for years
now: in the investment approval project, we include
the best solutions in terms of sustainability and rule
out technological solutions that are either unsustain-
able or not aligned with the Company's values.

We continued consolidating our presence in Emilia
Romagna through intense communication, sponsor-
ship and engagement efforts as well as by opening
new stores in Romagna. This did not mean leaving the
other regions behind: all of them saw new openings as
well as renovations or acquisitions—resulting in a pro-
portionate increase in employment within the trading
area and a type of growth in line with the Company's
sustainability practices.

In addition to developing its stores as usual, Aspiag
Service continues making significant investment also
to consolidate the future agri-food hub. It has also
invested heavily in technology to innovate its stores.
Our investing activities, which totalled €134.6 million
in 2019, go towards meeting the targets 11.3 and 11.4 of
the relevant SDG, as our stores are always intended to
be part of urban centres in a sustainable and inclusive
manner while protecting the existing cultural heritage.
