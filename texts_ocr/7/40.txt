CFO’s Comment on the Results

INCOME STATEMENT (RECLASSIFIED)

With €31.8 million in net profit and turnover up 4.6%,
our company continues performing positively, buck-
ing the trend of the reference market as consumption
remains stagnant.

The 2019 results show that both turnover and gross
margin received a boost from newly opened stores,
which bolster our presence throughout the trading
area. This growth was also positively affected by the
merger of Superdistribuzione S.r.l., a meat proces-
sor and cured meat producer, into Aspiag Service.
Business overhead expenses were up overall.

The increase in staff costs was associated with the
expansion of the sales network and the acquisition

of the Meat Centre as well as the entry into force of
the new national collective bargaining agreement.
Distribution expenses reflected the expansion of the
sales network and the resulting greater number of
parcels handled. Meanwhile, other operating costs
reflected a change in energy costs associated with
higher electricity rates, the new operations of the Meat
Centre, and greater maintenance costs following the
replacement of high-impact refrigerant gases.

Finally, EBT benefited from the positive performance
of financing activities as the Company secured better
terms on new and existing loans, laying the ground-
work for 2020.
