EMPLOYEE RECRUITING

The Human Resources Department carries out the
recruiting activity with regard to staff recruitment
for the headquarters and logistics. As for the recruit-
ment of sales staff, we have completed a project to
centralise this process, which involves deploying
recruiters across all the communities we operate in.
These work together with the sales area.
Recruitment techniques include phone interviews,
one-to-one interviews, group interviews, and speed
interviews (extremely short interviews allowing to
gather essential information on several candidates
at events such as job days or career days).

The experience at the headquarters or in the retail
stores can be done through employment or training
internships.

The latter, favouring the inclusion of young students
and new graduates, contribute to achieve Aspiag
Service’s objective of looking for talents whose
characteristics are in line with Company values, for

the purpose of also obtaining a source of content
and knowledge. This is why Aspiag Service works
together with universities, high schools, and pro-
fessional training providers as well as participates
in job days and recruiting or employer branding
events: these allow to create synergies between the
Company and young people through internships,
programmes for combined school-based and work-
based traineeships, education, and vocational train-
ing, unlocking the potential of each candidate in the
area that best suits their aptitudes and skills.
Besides employer branding events at universities to
recruit interns, Aspiag Service holds corporate pre-
sentations and speed interviews in schools to intro-
duce trainees enrolled in vocational programmes
and passionate about nutrition, catering, food and
wine to its stores. The number of applicants has
increased in 2019 also because of the relevant com-
munication directly within stores.
