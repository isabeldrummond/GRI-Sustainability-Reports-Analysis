BALANCE SHEET

To remain competitive and ensure the long-term via-
bility of our business, we endeavour to strengthen our
market presence and focus on sustainable investment
opportunities.

Accordingly, the Balance sheet shows this commit-
ment. With respect to assets, tangible fixed assets
reflected the expansionary policy pursued in the last
few years on the one hand, and on the other hand, the
investments made for the new agri-food hub, which
is nearing completion. As for current assets, invento-
ries were up because of the greater number of stores

and the liquidity deferred as a result of the increased
VAT credit. Likewise, with respect to liabilities, financial
payables rose, even if not proportionately, to support
investments in the sales and distribution network,
whereas trade payables were affected by the contribu-
tion from the merged entity.

Finally, equity grew as the company is constantly rein-
vesting profits (the dividend payout ratio is negligible),
which shows its willingness to expand into new mar-
kets and promote the future growth of the business.
