years now. Aspiag Service is in line with the sustainable

which sets out 17 goals—divided into 169 targets—to
promote fair and long-term global growth.

Our strategy as well as our operating-financial and
social-environmental performances disclosed in

promoted by the SDGs are deeply rooted inside the
