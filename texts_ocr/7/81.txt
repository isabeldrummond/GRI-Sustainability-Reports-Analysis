ASPIAG SERVICE « 2019 INTEGRATED REPORT

Methodological Notes

‘lo provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of how the information in this
Integrated Report is connected, we rely on guidelines and standards such as:

the International Integrated Reporting <IR>
Framework as published by the _ International
Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC);

the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards pub-
lished in 2016 by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
This report was prepared in accordance with the GRI
Standards: Core option;

UN 2030 Agenda's Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs);

the Italian Civil Code;

the accounting principles issued by the Italian
Accounting Standard Setter (OIC).

The Report follows the <IR> Framework for the con-
cepts of value creation and connectivity, the GRI for
the indicators covering socio-environmental issues,
and the UN 2030 Agenda (SDGs) for the path to
sustainability.

Aspiag Service's Integrated Report includes the vari-
ous content elements of the IIRC: organisational over-
view and external environment, governance (“About
us"); business model, risks and opportunities, strategy
and resource allocation (“What we do”); performance
(“What we did”); future outlook (“What we will do”);
basis of preparation and presentation (“Annexes”).
This reporting approach seeks to tell how the Company
creates value over time. The creation of business value
(page 34) starts with certain material indicators from
2018, which, when incorporated into and used by the
company’s business model, allow to achieve them and
the relevant impacts in 2019.

The impacts represent the topics that are significant
(or material) to the Company and stakeholders, such
as the impact of business operations in the context
Aspiag Service operates in.

The opening and closing indicators for the period and
the material topics are marked with different colours
that refer to the relevant capitals and are closely asso-
ciated with the company’s strategy, as the chapter
“Performance” show. For instance, the net investment
indicator (page 47) amounted to €130 million in 2018

and €134.6 million in 2019. The indicator is in light blue,
the colour associated with financial capital, and affects
the material topic “Financial performance”, which is
also in light blue.

The interactions resulting from this flow illustrate the
ideas of trade-off, i.e. the change (increase, decrease,
transformation) in available resources that turn into
new inputs for the subsequent reporting period, and
of connectivity—represented also through the matrix
on page 70. Our strategic objectives are in line with
the company’s mission, vision, and values as well as
the SDGs and stakeholder engagement (page 33). Our
reporting approach brings those aspects together to
provide stakeholders with a comprehensive picture of
the company.

As for the reporting process, the regular working group
set up to prepare the Integrated Report gathers quan-
titative and qualitative data that facilitate the shar-
ing of information. Additional information that is not
developed internally, such as information on the eco-
nomic context, is always reported by referencing the
source, and so are certain methods used to calculate
the data in the tables. The data in the 2019 Integrated
Report is compared to the years 2018 and 2017 to pro-
vide the reader with a comprehensive picture of the
Company's performance. The 2019 data include also
those of the merged entity Superdistribuzione S.r.l.,
whereas the 2018 and 2017 data referred exclusively
to Aspiag Service, in line with the Annual Financial
Statements. The way data is reported may change fur-
ther in the event of updates to the GRIs or according
to the different availability of data within the company.
The Independent Auditors EY S.p.A. verify and certify
the disclosures required by the GRI Standards.

This Report includes the Financial Statements in the
form of infographics (pages 38-43), which are based on
data from the Annual Financial Statements available in
