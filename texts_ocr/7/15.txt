SPAR Austria

The SPAR Austria Group (SPAR Holding AG) is the largest of the SPAR organisations worldwide and, in addi-
tion to being leader on the domestic market, has also established itself in other European markets such as
Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary and Italy. In addition, it has diversified its business by managing shopping cen-
tres through Spar European Shopping Centers (Ses) and selling sportswear and sports equipment (Hervis),

expanding its presence also in Germany, the Czech Republic and Romania.

SPAR Austria has adopted a forward-looking sustainability strategy. In 2019, the projects in this area were
aimed at reducing the sugar content in product recipes (approximately 1000 tonnes less since 2017), curbing
the use of plastics—by overhauling packaging to promote the use of paper, glass, and laser branding for
certain categories of fruit—and reducing energy consumption. At the Group level, this year food donations

prevented 5,393 tonnes of waste, amounting to €21.2 million, while sponsorships totalled €4 million.
