ASPIAG SERVICE « 2019 INTEGRATED REPORT

Environmental Management System

We foster responsible practices by providing training and information as well as raising awareness among employ-
ees about the environmental impact of our operations. We ensure compliance with environmental laws and regu-
lations—in order to minimise the relevant fines, which are normal when considering the number of our stores—as
well as allocate enough resources to guarantee the Environmental Management System remains operational at all
times and the resulting actions are implemented. With respect to the responsible management of environmental

resources, Aspiag Service carefully manages also water, which is taken primarily from Italy's water grid.

TERRITORY

By raising funds, offering sponsorships, and supporting
research efforts as well as associations, Aspiag Service
shows how important Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) is to the Company.

In 2019 several existing and new initiatives helped our
community:

the funds raised by selling Easter eggs and Christmas
presents allowed us to support charitable organi-
sations and associations in pursuing different kinds
of goals for the benefit of the community (research
and care institutions, foster homes, associations that
support children and families with disabilities). At the
same time, the Company actively helps the local com-
munity in the event of emergencies. This year, the “La
bellezza non affonda” (Beauty does not sink) fund-rais-
ing campaign allowed to donate €70,000 to Venice as
a high tide swept through the city.

by sponsoring events such as Trieste’s Barcolana,
the TedX conferences in Padua, Vicenza, Bolzano, and
Rovigo, and Padua’s Salone dei Sapori, Aspiag Service
was able to support the local community by playing a
leading role.

donations, through which we support projects for
the common good. The most significant projects
implemented this year were the inclusive park built by
the Robert Hollman Foundation in Padua, with rides
free of architectural barriers, and the renovation of the
University of Bologna's Botanical Garden—which was
possible also thanks to the first donation made during
the year.

Through this kind of efforts, Aspiag Service not only
provides an economic benefit to various initiatives
and associations, but also helps raise awareness about
them.

Aspiag Service donates edible but no longer market-
able goods to various charitable organisations. These
themes and activities also involve and develop our
employees, creating a sensibility and awareness that
spreads throughout the Company. Sponsorships,
donations, and fund-raising efforts increased in both
number and value during 2019. This focus on the com-
munity—and specifically food donations—is in line
with the SDG 12, which calls for reducing food waste
at the retail level. The benefits for the local community
include also the infrastructure we build to support not
only the store, but all members of the community, as
well as the indirect taxes we pay.
