Architecture

In addition to engines, the other principal technical area we are focusing on is the architecture. Our

architecture covers all principal technical specifications of future Ferrari models. We expect that innovation

requirements will arise principally from: the evolution of engine families; the level of hybridization and

electrification; modes of traction; the number of seats up to a real four-seater; and the body style, which
will vary much more significantly than in the past in light of the introduction of the Purosangue.

We expect that our core architectures will be the rear-mid-engine architecture and the front-mid-engine

architecture, each comprising several variants.

Rear-mid-engine architecture

The rear-mid-engine architecture is designed

to integrate multiple power units with a higher
specific power output than the 488 Pista. In this
architecture, combustion engines can be combined
with an electric motor to realize hybridization,
including a battery to enable electric range. In
combination, we have developed a new and highly
innovative 8-shift double clutch transmission
gearbox. Hybridization will impact the weight of
engines and therefore we will deploy new lightweight
technologies to compensate this impact. Package
efficiency will also be key to achieve a compact

car that reduces weight and inertia. In order to
apply the architecture to different powertrains, the
wheelbase may vary. The first example of this new
architecture is the SF90 Stradale.

Front-mid-engine

Front-mid-engine architecture

The front-mid-engine architecture, also a transaxle
powertrain concept, is even more flexible than the
rear-mid-engine architecture. This architecture is
able to accommodate an all wheel drive powertrain,
will allow for hybridization, and will have a flexible
wheelbase suited to a variety of engines as well

as seat configurations including two seaters and
four seaters. It will be accessible, spacious and
comfortable. Key to this architecture will be the new
suspension systems we are developing, with a high
range between comfort and sportiness.
