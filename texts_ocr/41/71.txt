Customer Satisfaction

We are devoted to the highest level of customer
satisfaction. We have a structured process to
assess the overall customer satisfaction on
product, service provided, events organized by

us and the overall customer experience with the
car. Specific KPls are constantly monitored and
analyzed by the Marketing Intelligence department.
The KPls are measured through bespoke surveys for
each car launch and collected for every new model,
from range vehicles to special and limited editions.
A similar approach is adopted for evaluating the
quality of service and satisfaction of our events.

The assessment process can involve proactively
submitting online questionnaires and conducting
telephone interviews with a sample of customers, or
the customers directly reaching out to Ferrari.

Product satisfaction is evaluated through three
different questionnaires in different time frames,
which enable Ferrari to collate customer comments
and feedback:

° Early stage: at the commercial launch of a new
Ferrari model, customer/prospect satisfaction is
monitored with Demo Test Drives of the new car
at dealer showroom (still not purchased).

* Second stage: after about 3-4 weeks of
ownership, the first customers of the new model
receive a survey, “Report200”, to gather their first
impressions of the recently purchased car. A brief
questionnaire, which is managed by the Ferrari
Customer Care, is conducted by phone with the
initial customers and ends after the first 200
replies have been collated.

* Third stage: a few months following the launch,
a third survey named New Car Buyer Satisfaction
(“NCBS”) is sent by email to customers. The
NCBS is a more complete, in depth and detailed
assessment on the car and is composed of more
than 100 online questions aimed at gathering a
thorough feedback of the vehicle.

Service satisfaction is evaluated through two
different indices: Customer Satisfaction Index
(“CSI”) and Ferrari Relationship Index (“FRI”).
The purpose of both indices is to evaluate
customer satisfaction in respect of sale and after-
sale service. CSI focuses more on the latest service
offered by the dealer, while FRI is designed for
gauging the long-term relationship established
between clients and Ferrari. All results are then
collated and analyzed through a statistical model
at our headquarters.

The results of the product and service satisfaction
analyses are used to outline any necessary action
plans for current models and, additionally, to
identify potential features to be added to the next
generation of vehicles. Recent surveys show that
customer satisfaction for Ferrari products and
services has constantly stayed at a very high level.

Starting from 2017, to improve the main events (such
as Cavalcade, Universo Ferrari, World Premiere,

etc) organized by Ferrari’s headquarters, the level of
customer satisfaction has also been evaluated. All
the results are collated and shared with Operative
Marketing. In addition, a similar approach has been
adopted for Ferrari Driving Courses worldwide (US,
Europe, Mainland China). In this case, the results
are collated and shared with the Corse Clienti
department and Hub representatives.
