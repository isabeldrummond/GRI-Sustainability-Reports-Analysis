Product development and technological

Our development efforts take into account the three
defining dimensions of Ferrari cars: performance;
versatility and comfort; and driving emotions.

Performance reflects features such as weight,
horsepower, torque, aerodynamic efficiency,
acceleration, and maximum speed, which all
contribute to determine the lap time on track.
We strive to ensure that every Ferrari is the best
performing car in its segment.

Versatility derives from spaciousness, accessibility
and mode of traction, including rear wheel drive

or all wheel drive and, in future, electric-powered
driving. Comfort results from the ease of the riding
experience and on board interface. Regulation will
affect development in this area - for example, a
prescribed electric range may be required in future
to access city centers.

Driving emotions is a key differentiator of Ferrari
cars. There are three elements to driving emotions:
sound, perceived acceleration and responsiveness
of the car. Sound is an important part of the
experience and very involving for the driver.
Perceived acceleration is the driver’s subjective
impression of the car acceleration beyond the
actual 0-100 or 0-200 km/h performance measured
in the car technical specifications. Responsiveness
requires that every driver command lead to a direct
and controllable reaction of the car.

These three dimensions variably interact in our
sports and GT cars. As we work on the future
product range, we strive to improve on each of
those dimensions, focusing for sports cars on
performance and driving emotions, and for GT cars
on versatility and comfort on board and fun to drive
- driving emotions.
