FERRARI N.V.

/ Vehicles emissions

decided to introduce the start & stop technology
as standard for the 488 family: the cars sold
afterwards decreased their CO, emissions by 6%).

We have the ambition to be producing by 2022 nearly
60% of the models with a hybrid powertrain

We have undertaken an important program to
develop hybrid and electric technology. One of
the more relevant topics of this generation, the
concept of the car in an era of climate change,
will likely be an opportunity for us. Innovation
runs within Ferrari, so the challenge of building

a Ferrari for a low-emissions future is one that

we are already embracing. In fact, we have the
ambition to be producing by 2022 nearly 60% of
the models with a hybrid powertrain. The SF90
Stradale, our first hybrid series-production car in
Ferrari history, launched in 2019, perfectly reflects
our commitment to this approach. The increased

offering of hybrid powertrains will allow us to meet
both specific regulatory requirements but also to
satisfy customers’ desires for significantly improved
emissions, while enhancing the driving emotions
that render Ferrari cars simply unique.

In 2019, we achieved a 35% reduction in CO,
emissions (compared to 2007) for our European
fleet through improvements in energy efficiency by
increasing the energy produced for the same level
of input and therefore reducing the cars’ energy
requirements.

According to our environmental commitment,

we also monitor other car-related air emissions,
adopting new solutions to improve performances.
In 2019, we introduced the GPF (gasoline
particulate filter) to reduce particulate emissions.
Moreover, the SF90 Stradale has been designed with
a new combustion chamber with central injector
that lowers exhaust gas emissions (NOx, CO, HC).

©) For the purpose of this graph, 100% of the Ferrari fleet in EU has been taken into account to determine the average specific emissions of CO,,
despite the phase-in criteria granted in the years 2010-2014. 2019: provisional fleet average emissions of CO,. 2018: preliminary data released

by the European Commission.
