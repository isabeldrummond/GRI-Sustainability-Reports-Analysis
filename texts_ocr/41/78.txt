Working environment

We know that the best individual and team performance is only achieved if employees
feel they are in the right environment. We also believe that the quality of our products
cannot be separated from the lives of the people working in Ferrari.

This is why the working environment and wellbeing
of the Company’s employees are among our most
important priorities, representing the key focus of
our “Formula Uomo” initiatives.

Our complex in Maranello, a state-of-the-art

work environment, was designed to reinforce

the synergistic relationship between work and
results. With the needs of our employees firmly in
mind, our manufacturing facilities are specifically
created to combine carefully designed lighting
systems, projected to maximize the amount of
natural light, and several external and internal
green areas. Thermal comfort throughout the
factory is also a crucial requirement; since 2013,
the in-plant foundry is equipped with a cooling
system that makes it air-conditioned and climate
controlled. Special measures aimed at reducing the
environmental impact and noise through the use
of advanced technologies are also in place. As an
example, the design of our Machining Department
is aimed at providing the workplace with maximum
acoustic comfort thanks to noise reduction
solutions (source and reverberation).

To promote an active lifestyle among our employees,
we rely on our “Formula Benessere” program, aimed
at providing preventative healthcare to employees
and their children. A gym is available for all the
employees at Maranello and employees at the
Modena plant have free membership in one of the
city gyms. Initially provided to the F1 racing team

as part of their training program for the Grand Prix
activities, the initiative was subsequently rolled out
to all employees.

As part of the “Formula Benessere” benefits,
preventative healthcare is provided to all
employees and their children. Medical specialists
are available for consultation in areas such

as ophthalmic, cardiology, osteopathy and
dermatology, among others. A free annual
check-up focusing on general health and fitness

is also provided to managers and children of

all employees aged 5 to 15. In 2019, “Formula
Benessere Donna”, a preventative healthcare
program specifically designed for women’s health,
was launched. All female employees are offered
the opportunity of undergoing a free gynecological
examination as well as mammary and thyroid
gland ultrasound scans.

benefitted from “Formula Benessere” service in 2019

Our attention to the promotion of health and safety
among our employees goes beyond what is required
by law, and to this effect, special workshops are
organized for employees to raise awareness on the
importance of these topics.

To foster a sense of belonging among employees

and their families and to offer concrete support

to working parents with the demanding duties of
childcare during school holidays, we have launched
the program “Formula Estate Junior”. This initiative
consist of a free day camp for employees’children
aged 3 to 13, with various programs including sports,
outdoor activities, excursions and workshops. The
program, at its 10" edition, has a duration of 11
weeks (with a shorter 4-day version taking place
