FERRARI N.V.

/ Stakeholder engagement

We rely on a significant number of suppliers

who play an important part in the success of the
Group: for the sourcing of certain key components
with high technological specifications, we have
developed strong synergistic relationships with
some of our suppliers, which are considered “key
strategic innovation partners”.

We continue to invest heavily to minimize our
environmental impact. Our vehicles must comply
with extensive regional, national and local laws
and regulations, as well as industry self-regulations
(including those that regulate vehicle safety).

We are a dual-listed Company, therefore, the
financial discipline, enhanced through the
relationship with shareholders and investors,
further supports the Company in pursuing its
business targets.

Furthermore, we collaborate with universities and high
schools to provide scholarships to talented students.

40 Sustainability Report 2019

In 2019, we carried out various stakeholder
engagement activities in order to enhance the
voice of our stakeholders. We engaged with our
employees by explaining what sustainability stands
for within Ferrari while taking into consideration
their priorities. We also engaged with our top
investors to better understand what they consider
to be the main ESG drivers for Ferrari, as well as
Participating in a variety of ESG questionnaires such
as the SAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment
(CSA) and the CDP Climate Change questionnaire.
All these activities allowed us to further strengthen
our materiality analysis.

Considering the rising environmental and social
changes, these engagement activities are an
important part of the sustainability approach that
helps us identifying our sustainability risks and
opportunities, as well as supporting management in
achieving the Company’s objectives.
