INDEX

In a ceremony attended by Ferrari Chairman John
Elkann on November 6, 2019, Amatrice’s new
Istituto Omnicomprensivo Multi-school Campus,
was officially named in honor of the late

Sergio Marchionne. Ferrari will continue its
relationship with the Istituto Sergio Marchionne,
which was originally built in the aftermath of the
earthquake that devastated Central Italy in 2016
and will be offering top students an educational
experience in Maranello.

Ferrari has established collaborations with leading
universities worldwide that include the possibility
for students to develop Bachelor and Doctoral
theses as well as other research projects.

Ferrari is partner of the Motorvehicle University of
Emilia-Romagna (MUNER), an association which
was strongly advocated by the Emilia-Romagna
region. It was created thanks to a synergistic
connection among the universities of Modena and
Reggio Emilia, Bologna, Ferrara and Parma along
with car companies in the region that represent
the excellence of Italian brands, which of course
includes Ferrari.

| Creating and sharing value with the community |

The Motorvehicle University of Emilia-Romagna
hub aims at attracting the best university students
from all over the world, with the goal of training
and introducing into the corporate world the
engineers of tomorrow. The training offer is
composed of two different master’s degrees,
Advanced Automotive Engineering (AAE) and
Advanced Automotive Electronic Engineering
(AAEE), during which all the partners of the
initiative participate in educational activities
through seminars, laboratories and lessons, and
by inviting students to visit production plants.

We invest a lot in this activity, to the point that
some of our Maestri hold a few classes sharing
their exclusive Ferrari knowledge. In 2019, the
number of enrollments in the two master’s degrees
increased, with about a fifth of the students
coming from foreign countries. The goal of this
project is to foster the creation of a critical mass
of professionals with the skills needed for the
automotive of the future. October 24, 2019, saw
the graduation of the first 25 students of MUNER.
