We are aware of our responsibility towards the
community and our efforts are directed to support
the development of the local community, mainly
through collaborations with local universities
and thanks to the industry network in the Emilia-
Romagna region. We believe that promoting

the education of young talents is an essential
step to reinforce the connection with local
communities. Shaping brilliant engineers with

a specific academic background that focuses

on new technologies within the automotive
industry, and in particular innovative solutions
for state-of-the-art performance in luxury cars, is
also a prerequisite for the Group to seize future
opportunities.

Ferrari aims to promote education in the local
community also at secondary school level. Ferrari has
established long-term relationships with technical
schools in Maranello and other towns nearby. The
main collaborations consist in: participating in
Orientation committees; establishing “school-work”
projects for students; bringing the testimony of Ferrari
technicians in classrooms; implementing training of
trainers (TOT) activities; donating Ferrari equipment;
and participating in public tenders to finance technical
classrooms and labs in collaboration with local
schools. The aim of these initiatives is to support
schools in providing the new generations with the
skills and tools needed to meet the rapid technological
changes taking place in society.
