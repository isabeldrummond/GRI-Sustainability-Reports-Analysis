We continue to make significant investments in safety at work: improvements in the existing structures

and specific training have allowed us to achieve significant results. Mandatory health and safety training

is provided to all new hires during the second day of the induction program, while periodic sessions are
developed for all employees. We provide employees who test our cars with specific on-track driving training

to make sure they have all the skills required to perform emergency maneuvers, if necessary. As shown in the
table above, in 2019 the hours of training are in line with 2018, mainly due to the mandatory periodic training
update for employees started last year. In addition, a constantly updated dynamic health protocol is in place
and a specific health and safety section is part of the training program of the Department Team Leaders.

Particularly effective has been the program to highlight the so-called “near misses”: events that could have
caused accidents but did not because of the preventative actions of employees. Moreover, most of the
buildings are provided with a defibrillator along with the standard health and safety equipment.
