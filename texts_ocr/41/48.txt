Whistleblowing

Violations of the Code of Conduct are determined
through periodic activities carried out by our
Internal Audit and Compliance Departments,
through the analysis of the reports received in
accordance with the Ethics Helpline Management
Procedures and through checks which form part of
the standard operating procedures.

The Ethics Helpline is a dedicated channel that
allows employees, suppliers, dealers, consumers
and other stakeholders to request advice about the
application of the Code of Conduct, and to report
any concerns about alleged situations, events,

or actions that they believe may be inconsistent
with the Code of Conduct. Stakeholders can also
report alleged violations anonymously if permitted
by local law. The Ethics Helpline can be accessed
either by phone or by web intake (with multiple
languages available) and is an essential element of
the management process, in accordance with the
Code of Conduct, in relation to raised concerns. It
is managed by an independent provider, available
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Furthermore, Ferrari employees may also seek advice
concerning the application and interpretation of
the Code of Conduct by contacting their immediate
supervisor, Human Resources representatives or the
Legal and Compliance Departments.

Internal Audit, with the support of the Legal
Department, Human Resources and other
business functions possibly involved, assesses all

| Proactively fostering best practice governance

the allegations received. The results and potential
disciplinary actions are then reported based on the
necessary escalation process (the relevant internal
functions are notified of the violations).

On November 15, 2017, Italian law for whistleblowing,
which contains provisions for the protection of
reporters of crimes or irregularities that have

come to light in the context of a public or private
employment relationship, was definitively adopted
(Law n. 179/2017). The law concerns the protection
of workers, public or private, who report or denounce
crimes or other illegal conduct which they have come
to know about in the context of their employment
relationship. Our whistleblowing procedures are in line
with the provisions of Law n.179/2017.

The violations of the Code of Conduct have been
categorized according to the Principles of the
Code of Conduct. Accordingly, Managing Our
Assets and Information includes: Communicating
Effectively, Protecting Ferrari Assets and
Maintaining Appropriate Records. The category
Interacting with External Parties comprises
Avoiding Conflicts of Interest and Supporting
Our Communities. Conducting Business covers
Sustainably Purchasing Goods or Services,
Transacting Business Legally and Engaging in
Sustainable Practices. Finally, Protecting Our
Workforce includes behaviors related

to Maintaining a Fair and Secure Workplace,
and Ensuring Health and Safety. For all Code of
Conduct violations, the disciplinary measures
taken are commensurate with the seriousness of
the case and comply with local legislation.
