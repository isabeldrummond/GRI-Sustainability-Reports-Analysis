FERRARI N.V.

 

Brand Activities

Ferrari is one of the world’s leading luxury brands.

We engage in brand development and protection
activities through licensing contracts with selected
partners, retail activities through a chain of
franchised or directly managed stores, licensed theme
parks and the development of a line of apparel and
accessories sold exclusively in our monobrand stores
and on our website www.store.ferrari.com.

Ferrari owns and manages two museums, one in
Maranello and one in Modena, which attracted
more than 600,000 visitors in 2019.

Licensing, Entertainment

and Theme Parks

We enter into license agreements with a number
of licensees for the design, development and
production of Ferrari branded products.

We carefully select our licensees through a rigorous
process and we contractually seek to ensure that
our brand and intellectual property are protected
and that the products which will eventually bear
our brand are of adequate quality, appearance

and market positioning. Ferrari branded products
include consumer electronics, sportswear, toys,
video games, watches and other accessories, as well
as theme parks.

In 2019, we commenced our participation in
eSports (i.e., electronic sports) with the launch of
an entertainment platform and the selection of

a team which took part in two of the main world
championships: F1 Pro Series 2019 and SRO
E-Sport GT Series, which our team won.

30 Sustainability Report 2019

A significant portion of our revenues from licensing
activities consists of royalties we receive in connection
with Ferrari World, our theme park in Abu Dhabi.
Ferrari World opened on Yas Island, on the North
East side of Abu Dhabi’s mainland, in 2010. Ferrari
World’s iconic sleek red roof is directly inspired by
the classic double curve side profile of the Ferrari GT
body, spanning 200,000 square meters and carrying
the largest Ferrari logo ever created. Ferrari World
Abu Dhabi offers an all-around Ferrari experience to
children and adults alike.

Our second theme park, Ferrari Land Portaventura,
opened in April 2017 near Barcelona, and includes
Red Force, the tallest and fastest roller-coaster in
Europe. In the long-term we aim to open one theme
park in each of the main geographic areas where we
operate, including North America and Asia.

Retail

Through our network of stores (franchised or directly
managed), we offer a wide range of Scuderia Ferrari
branded products, including a line of apparel and
accessories exclusively sold in our stores and on our
website. All products sold in our stores and on our
website are either directly sourced from our selected
network of suppliers or manufactured by our licensees.

As at December 31, 2019, there were a total of 44
retail Ferrari stores, including those in Maranello,
Milan, Rome, Macau, Miami, Los Angeles,
Johannesburg, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, of which 24
are franchised stores (including 15 Ferrari Store
Junior) and 20 stores owned and operated by us.
