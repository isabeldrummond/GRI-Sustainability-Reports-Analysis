Plants and circuits

Environmental management
systems

We have invested heavily to minimize our
environmental impact since 2001, when the
Company was given the ISO 14001 certification
for our plants in Maranello and Modena. In 2016,
we obtained the renewal of the certification of our
environmental management system according to
the new standard ISO 14001:2015. In addition,

in 2007 we obtained and renewed the Integrated
Environmental Authorization. As mentioned in
our Environmental Policy, our effort is to minimize
the negative impact of our activities on natural
resources and the global environment.

The Mugello Circuit S.p.A. obtained and renewed
the certification for the environmental management
system with ISO 14001 and the EMAS
(Eco-Management and Audit Scheme).

Efficient energy use

Our culture embraces a rational use of energy,
which is mainly used for the manufacturing of cars
and engines. Over the years, the Group has strived
to lower its energy consumption and to minimize
its environmental impact, adopting innovative
solutions and using renewable energy sources for its
manufacturing facilities. In 2008, we installed our
first solar panels and subsequently increased capacity
in 2011 and 2015. Since 2014, Ferrari S.p.A. has
been purchasing electricity with Guarantee of Origin
certificates.

1 21 GWh of energy produced
by Ferrari’s trigenerator

In addition, from 2009, we started using electricity
along with hot and cold water generated by the
trigeneration plant). In 2019, the trigeneration
plant produced 83% of the electricity needed for
the Maranello plant, while the remaining 17%
originated from renewable sources”).

() Even if the trigenerator plant was bought by Ferrari in September 2016, data referring to energy consumption and emissions consolidate

trigenerator plant data for the whole 2016 for comparative reasons.
