Our Journey to Sustainability

In 2019, Ferrari made significant and manifold
strides on its journey to sustainability. This progress
was driven by a strategy designed around the five
pillars outlined below and cut across every area

of the Group as well as its product and processes
interventions and innovations.

Exceeding expectations: drive technological
innovation while pursuing excellence in design and
craftsmanship to fuel the passion of our customers
and fans.

Innovation is part of Ferrari’s DNA, so we support
and promote it both inside and outside the confines
of the Company.

Our greatest source of innovation is our employees.
Through programmes such as Pole Position,

we encourage them to think creatively and to
communicate their ideas and solutions with regard
to improving our products, methods and working
environment. The response from our employees

in 2019 was extraordinary with around 20,000
suggestions and proposals submitted, almost
double the previous year’s figure.

Another inexhaustible source of inspiration is the
Scuderia Ferrari’s involvement in the Formula 1
World Championship. Competing with the other
teams at such an extremely high level acts as a
constant stimulus to produce new technological
solutions which are then transferred to our road
cars, the hybrid propulsion unit being a case

in point.

Ferrari also supports and promotes innovation
outside the Company, through partnerships and
synergies with other bodies and entities, including
some from different sectors to our own. Proof

of this comes from our many collaborations

with universities and research centres. The latter

work with Ferrari to translate the most advanced
theoretical research into solutions useful to its
industrial processes. Start-ups too offer extremely
interesting opportunities to foster a virtuous circle
of innovation.

Proactively fostering best practice governance:
maintain Ferrari’s corporate governance and risk
management systems aligned with best practices
to ensure an ethical business conduct while
providing superior and sustainable returns to our
shareholders.

Car manufacturers are subject to rapidly

changing legislation and standards across the
world. The European, US and Chinese markets in
particular are being impacted by new regulations
implemented in response to legitimate concerns
about vehicle safety, fuel consumption, noise levels
and environmental impact.

Ferrari is committed to creating a culture

of sustainability to address the complex scenario
the global automotive industry is now facing.
This culture demands efficient corporate
governance and risk management, a proactive
decision-making process and openness to change,
all extending not just to our Company processes
as a whole but through our entire supply chain.

A focus on excellence in terms of the quality,
design and performance of our products, must be
and is being flanked by responsible management
of our relations with commercial partners,
suppliers and dealers, who we encourage

to adopt and share sustainable practices.
Specifically, all of our suppliers must comply

with our Code of Conduct which is as much a
condition of collaborating with Ferrari as the high
quality standards of the goods or services they
provide to us.
