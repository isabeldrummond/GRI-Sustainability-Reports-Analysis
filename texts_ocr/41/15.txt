Ferrari is among the world’s leading luxury brands focused on the design, engineering,
production and sale of the world’s most recognizable luxury performance sports cars.

Our brand symbolizes exclusivity, innovation, state-of-the-art sporting performance
and Itakan design, craftsmanship and engineering heritage. Our name and history
and the image enjoyed by our cars are closely associated with our Formula I racing
team, Scuderia Ferrari, the most successful team in Formula 1 history. From the
inaugural year of Formula I in 1950 through the present, Scuderia Ferrari has won
238 Grand Prix races, 16 Constructor World titles and 15 Drivers’ World titles.

We believe our history of excellence, technologicalinnovation and defining style transcends
the automotive industry, and is the foundation of the Ferrari brand and image.

We design, engineer and produce our cars in Maranello, Italy, and sell them in over
60 markets worldwide through a network of 166 authorized dealers operating 187

points of sale as of the end of 2019.

We believe our cars are the epitome of
performance, luxury and styling. Our product
offering comprises four main pillars: the sports
range, the GT range, special series and Icona, a
line of modern cars inspired by our iconic cars of
the past. Our current product range (including
cars presented in 2019, for which shipments will
commence in 2020) is comprised of five sports

F8 Tributo commencing in the fourth quarter of
2019 and shipments of the other cars expected to
commence in 2020.

Whilst broadening our product portfolio to target
a larger customer base, we continue to pursue

a low volume production strategy in order to
maintain a reputation for exclusivity and scarcity
among purchasers of our cars and we carefully
manage our production volumes and delivery
waiting lists to promote this reputation. We

divide our regional markets into EMEA, Americas,
Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and Rest
of APAC, representing respectively 48.3 percent,
28.6 percent, 8.3 percent and 14.8 percent of units
shipped in 2019.

We focus our marketing and promotion efforts in
the investments we make in our racing activities and
in particular, Scuderia Ferrari’s participation in the
Formula 1 World Championship, which is one of
the most watched annual sports series in the world,
with approximately 405.5 million unique television
