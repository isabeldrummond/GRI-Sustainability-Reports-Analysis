Our Governance and Sustainability Committee

The Governance and Sustainability Committee is
responsible for, among other things, assisting and
advising the Board of Directors, and acting under
authority delegated by the Board of Directors, with
respect to:

(i) the identification of the criteria, professional
and personal qualifications for candidates to
serve as Directors,

(ii) periodic assessment of the size and composition
of the Board of Directors,

(iii) periodic assessment of the functioning of
individual Directors and reporting on this to the
Board of Directors,

(iv) proposals for appointment of executive and
non-executive Directors,

(v) supervision of the selection criteria and
appointment procedure for senior management,

(vi) monitoring and evaluating reports on the
Group’s sustainable development policies and
practices, management standards, strategy,
performance and governance globally, and

(vii) reviewing, assessing and making
recommendations as to strategic guidelines for
sustainability-related issues, and reviewing the
annual Sustainability Report.

The Governance and Sustainability Committee
currently consists of Mr. John Elkann (Chairperson),
Ms. Giuseppina Capaldo and Mr. Eddy Cue. Effective
as of July 24, 2019 Mr. Eddy Cue was appointed
member of the Governance & Sustainability
Committee instead of Mr. Sergio Duca.

The Governance and Sustainability Committee is
elected by the Board of Directors and is comprised

of at least three Directors. More than half of the

Corporate Governance Code, and at most one of the
members may be an executive Director.

In 2019 the Governance and Sustainability Committee
met once with 100 percent attendance of its members
at such meeting. The Committee reviewed the Board
of Directors’ and Committee’s assessments, the
Sustainability achievement and objectives, and the
recommendations for Directors’ election.
