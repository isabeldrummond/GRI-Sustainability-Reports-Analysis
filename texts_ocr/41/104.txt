Raw Materials

Car makers consume large amounts of raw materials and a conscientious planning of the manufacturing
process is essential to the management of scarce resources.

Among the most used materials in our cars are light alloys, such as aluminum: to reduce the sourcing of
aluminum, specific initiatives to reuse scraps have been developed (see “Our Environmental Responsibility -
Waste management”).

We measure and monitor the presence of hazardous substances in our homologated vehicles, as required
by local regulations. Every Ferrari homologated vehicle, therefore every component installed, follows

the REACH prescriptions. Every Ferrari vehicle is compliant to 2000/53/EC (End-of-life Directive), as
applicable.

Our suppliers are requested to comply with 2011/65/UE (ROHS Directive) and 2000/53/EC (End-of-life
Directive), and to provide, through the International Material Data System, all the information related to
the composition of substances used in the manufacturing process. Our internal systems automatically reject
non-compliant components.
