Vehicle Safety

Vehicle safety is among our top priorities and Ferrari
cars are always designed and manufactured with

the safety of our customers and other road users in
mind. Given the nature of our cars, the electronic
equipment is developed with an integrated approach,
ensuring the best balance between safety, control
and best-in-class performance, to further enhance
the Ferrari driving emotions.

All of our range models are subject to a series of tests
to obtain approval from the relevant authorities.
Moreover, we start assessing all our new models

at an early stage of planning and design to identify
areas of improvement.

To guarantee the highest level of passenger safety, we
develop both passive and active safety systems.

Passive safety requirements are the initial guidelines
assigned to the engineers in order to define the
design of every component, from car framework to
all the retain components (airbags, seat belts, etc.).
Moreover, specific devices are installed in racing
cars to obtain FIA (Federation International de
Automobile) approval.

With the aim of solving issues beforehand and
reducing the environmental impact of these activities,
all tests are reproduced in a state-of-the-art virtual
environment before conducting them with real cars.

Regarding Active safety, we believe that the future
developments of vehicle safety will be linked to
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and
human-machine interface (HMI), capable of

preventing or mitigating crash occurrences. We

are currently assessing the implementation of the
most recent trends and developments in terms of
simplifying and easing the interaction between the
car and the driver to avoid any distraction. In 2019,
we extended ADAS to our entire fleet, after the initial
introduction on the GTC4Lusso in 2018.

In 2019, we launched the SF90 Stradale, the first
hybrid series-production car in Ferrari’s history.
This new model encapsulates the most advanced
technologies developed in Maranello, including
the HMI, which with its track derived “eyes on the
street, hands on the steering wheel” philosophy
takes on a truly central role. The result is an HMI
(Human-Machine Interface) that is a complete
departure from previous models. The “hands-on-
the--steering-wheel” philosophy has consistently
driven the development of the human-machine
interface in every Ferrari F1 car and its subsequent
gradual transfer to its road-going sports cars. The
SF90 Stradale’s steering wheel completes that
transfer process from the racing competition and
also ushers in a new era by introducing a series of
touch commands that allow the driver to control
virtually every aspect of the car without ever taking
their hands off the wheel. The Head Up Display

is another part of the innovative HMI and allows
various data to be projected onto the windshield
within the driver’s field of vision so that their
attention is not distracted from driving.
