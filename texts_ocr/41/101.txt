Biodiversity and noise pollution

Our plants and racing circuits, as of December 2019, are not located in any protected or highly biodiverse
areas and, to our best knowledge, they do not have a significant environmental impact on such areas.
Moreover, our plants and racing circuits are not adjacent"®) to any protected or highly biodiverse areas.
This analysis is conducted annually and is based on the World Database on Protected Areas‘"”).

However, the Mugello racing circuit is located in an extremely important natural landscaping area.

 

Therefore, the main tribune has been constructed using eco-active materials with zero impact on the
surrounding zone to help reduce both pollutants and bacteria.

With regard to the noise produced in proximity of the Fiorano and Mugello circuits, the acoustic
monitoring of the plant perimeter is regularly carried out and Mugello Circuit complies with the 2019
authorization received by the appropriate authorities.

(18) For this analysis, a distance of 3 km or less has been considered as “adjacent”.

(”) The database considered for the analysis is managed by the United Nations Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-
WCMC) with support from IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas.
