INDEX

Particularly driven by growth in the GT segment,
Ferrari has developed the next generation of human
machine interface (HMI) technologies.

Using state-of-the-art technologies we will be
guided by the Formula 1 derived concept of “eyes
on the street, hands on the steering wheel”, for a
focused, safe and enjoyable drive. The new HMI
includes several new technologies, including a new
head-up display, a new innovative cluster, a new
steering wheel that features new commands and a
new infotainment system, as well as tools aimed at
positively enhancing the passengers’ experience.

While we do not intend to develop self-driving

cars, we will adopt certain features of autonomous
driving technology in response to regulatory
developments and customer preferences, especially
in the GT segment. For example, in 2018 we
launched initial functionalities for Advanced
Driving Assistant Systems (ADAS) such as predictive
breaking and automatic cruise control on current
models, and further innovations will be introduced
in future models.

Ferrari is carefully monitoring the evolution of
autonomous driving technologies, including sensors
and artificial intelligence, and we will select and
customize those innovations compatible with the
Ferrari experience. These technologies will also have
an important impact on the electronic architecture

of our cars.
