FERRARI N.V.

Integrity of Business Conduct

The foundation of Ferrari’s governance model is
the Code of Conduct that reflects our commitment
to a culture dedicated to integrity, responsibility

and ethical behavior. Ferrari endorses the United
Nations (“UN”) Declaration on Human Rights,
the International Labor Organization (“ILO”)
Conventions and the Organization for Economic
Co-Operation and Development (“OECD”)
Guidelines for Multinational Companies.
Accordingly, the Code of Conduct is intended to be
consistent with such guidelines and aims to ensure
that all members of the Ferrari Group workforce
act with the highest level of integrity, comply with
applicable laws, and build a better future for our
Company and the communities in which we do
business. The complete Code of Conduct can be
found on our website at

http://corporate.ferrari.com/en/governance/code-conduct.

Ferrari’s integrity system comprises the following

primary elements:

* Principles that capture the Company’s
commitment to important values in business and
personal conduct;

* Practices that are the basic rules that must guide
our daily behaviors required to achieve our
overarching Principles;

* Procedures that further articulate the Company’s
specific operational approach to achieving
compliance and that may have specific
applications limited to certain geographical
regions and/or businesses as appropriate.

Our Code of Conduct is approved by the board of
directors of Ferrari N.V. and applies to all board
members and officers, as well as full-time and part-
time employees of the Ferrari Group.

The Code of Conduct also applies to all temporary,
contract and all other individuals and companies
that act on behalf of the Ferrari Group.

 

The Code of Conduct is completed with the
following Ferrari Practices: (i) Conducting Business,
(ii) Interacting with External Parties, (iii) Managing

our Assets and Information and, (iv) Protecting our
Workforce. These Practices, which further explain the
Code of Conduct, can be consulted by all employees
on the Company intranet.

Internal Audit investigates possible violations of the
Code of Conduct during standard periodic audits
and through specific Business Ethics Compliance
(BEC) audits. In 2019, BEC surveys were carried
out to measure employees’ awareness on: Code

of Conduct, Whistleblowing Procedure, Gift and
Entertainment Expenses Management. In light of
the results, dedicated training activities have been
implemented accordingly.

The Company’s governance model includes policies
for respecting Human Rights, which prohibit child
and forced labor and pay attention to safe working
environment for our employees.

Anti-Bribery and Corruption

Ferrari’s Code of Conduct includes, among others,
rules related to anti-bribery, anti-corruption,
competitive behavior and conflicts of interest. Ferrari
is committed to the highest standards of integrity,
honesty and fairness in all internal and external
affairs and will not tolerate any kind of bribery.

The laws of virtually all countries in which Ferrari
operates prohibit bribery. Ferrari’s policy is that
no one - director, officer, or other employee, agent
or representative - shall, directly or indirectly, give,
offer, request, promise, authorize, solicit or accept
bribes or any other perquisite (including gift or
gratuities with the exception of commercial items
universally accepted in an international context of
modest economic value, permitted by applicable
laws and in compliance with the Code of Conduct
and all applicable practices and procedures) in
connection with their work for Ferrari at any time
or for any reason. A violation of anti-bribery and
anti-corruption laws is a serious offense for both
companies and individuals, which can result

in significant fines, reputational damage and
imprisonment of individuals.
