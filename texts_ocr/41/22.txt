Sports Range

Our sports cars are characterized by compact
bodies, a design guided by performance and
aerodynamics, and often benefit from technologies
initially developed for our Formula 1 single-seaters.
They favor performance over comfort, seeking to
provide a driver with an immediate response and
superior handling, leveraging state of the art vehicle
dynamics components and controls. In our sports
car class, we offer five models: the SF90 Stradale,
our first series production car which features PHEV
technology that combines a V8 engine (780 hp)
with three electric motors that allow the car to
reach 1,000 hp; the F8 Tributo and the F8 Spider
are equipped with a mid-rear V8 engine (720 hp),

a 4 time winner of the engine of the year award; the
812 Superfast and the 812 GTS are equipped with a
front V12 engine (800 hp).

GT Range

Our GT cars, while maintaining the performance
expected of a Ferrari, are characterized by more
refined interiors with a higher focus on comfort
and on-board life quality. In our GT class, we offer
three models equipped with our V8 engine, the
Ferrari Roma (620 hp), combining sportiness and
elegant design; the Ferrari Portofino (600 hp) and
the GTC4Lusso T (610 hp), the first Ferrari 4 seater
equipped with a V8 turbo engine. We also offer
one GT model equipped with our V12 engine, the
GTC4Lusso (690 hp), our sport-luxury 4 seater and
4 wheel drive.
