Building a better
working world

Therefore, the extent of work performed in our examination was lower than that required for a full
examination according to the ISAE 3000 Revised ("reasonable assurance engagement") and, hence,
it does not provide assurance that we have become aware of all significant matters and events that
would be identified during a reasonable assurance engagement.

The procedures performed on the Report were based on our professional judgment and included
inquiries, primarily with company’s personnel responsible for the preparation of the information
included in the Report, documents analysis, recalculations and other procedures in order to obtain
evidences considered appropriate.

In particular, we have performed the following procedures:

e Analysis of the process relating to the definition of material aspects included in the Report, with
reference to the criteria applied to identify priorities for the different stakeholders categories and
to the internal validation of the process outcomes;

e Comparison of economic and financial data and information included in the Report with those
included in the Group's consolidated Annual Report as of December 31°, 2019, on which we
issued our audit report on February 18", 2020.

Understanding of the processes that lead to the generation, detection and management of
significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the Report.

In particular, we have conducted interviews and discussions with the management and the
personnel of Ferrari S.p.A. and we have performed limited documentary evidence procedures, in
order to collect information about the processes and procedures that support the collection,
aggregation, processing and transmission of data and information to the department responsible
for the preparation of the Report.

Furthermore, for significant information, considering the Group's activities and characteristics:
- at Group level

a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the Report we carried out
inquiries and acquired supporting documentation to verify its consistency with the
available evidence;

b) with reference to quantitative information, we have performed both analytical
procedures and limited assurance procedures to ascertain on a sample basis the correct
aggregation of data.

- For Ferrari S.p.A. production facility located in Maranello (Modena), which we have selected
based on its activity, relevance to the consolidated performance indicators and location, we
have carried out a site visit during which we have had discussions with management and have
obtained evidence about the appropriate application of the procedures and the calculation
methods used to determine the indicators.

Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that
Sustainabilty Report of Ferrari Group for the year ended on December 31*, 2019 has not been
prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the requirements of the GRI Standards, as
described in the paragraph “Methodology and Scope" of the Sustainability Report.
