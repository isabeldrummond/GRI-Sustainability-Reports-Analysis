FERRARI N.V.

 

Our environmental responsibility

Our most significant environmental efforts are deployed through efficiencies in the
manufacturing processes and a program for the reduction of polluting emissions.

We assemble all of our cars and manufacture all the
engines used in our cars or sold to Maserati at our
production facility in Maranello” (Italy).

The Carrozzeria Scaglietti plant, located in Modena
(Italy), is where we manufacture aluminum bodyworks
and chassis. The two plants cover a cumulative area of
approximately 716,000 m?. We also own the Mugello
racing circuit in Scarperia, near Florence (Italy), which
covers an area of 1,700,000 m? (of which 1,200,000
m? of green or tree-covered areas).

We directly operate 20 retail stores and maintain
offices for our foreign subsidiaries and other
smaller facilities in Italy, such as the Museo Enzo
Ferrari (MEF) in Modena and the Ferrari museum
in Maranello. The environmental impact of these
additional facilities is deemed negligible and is
excluded in this chapter’s data.

The monitoring and management of the
environmental performance of our productive
plants is assigned to a team that reports to our
Chief Technology Officer. Their effort is aimed

at minimizing the impact of our activities on

the environment, particularly in relation to the
energy consumption of production facilities. A
different team is in charge of overseeing regulatory
developments while monitoring the emissions of
Ferrari cars.

Part of the environmental impact of our
activities are related to the product lifecycle.
Ferrari cars are perceived as collectibles and
therefore the number of cars demolished each
year is very scarce. In addition, the products
are generally not considered means of
transportation.

Conscious of the risks and opportunities related
to climate change, as one of the more relevant
defining factors for long-term value creation, we
plan to progressively develop our environmental
governance, strategy, metrics and goals, in

line with TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures) and other relevant
recommendations.

() Maranello production facility is composed by the main offices and production buildings, the “Nuova Gestione Sportiva” building and the

adjacent Fiorano track (of approximately 3,000 meters).
