fields. The project consists of three main tools,
with a common goal of knowledge sharing

and strategical know-how growth, while also
improving the network of opportunities in the
innovation ecosystem. The internal event called
Smart Technology Trends Roundtable offers
employees the opportunity to take a deep dive
into new topics through dedicated lectures from
universities, research or other industry experts,
therefore creating a conducive environment for
brainstorming new ideas.

The two editions of 2019 covered stimulating
topics that fostered creativity, know-how and the
generation of new ideas. The second tool, Smart
Technology Trends journal covers a large number
of innovation topics, analyzing new technologies in
the automotive, cross or start-up worlds. Finally,
an Innovation Newsletter with tips and highlights
is completing the overview on artificial intelligence,
sensors, future mobility, connectivity, human
machine interface technologies, and many other
topics of interest.

Design

Design is a fundamental and distinctive aspect
of our products and our brand. Our designers,
modelers and engineers work together to create
car bodies that incorporate the most innovative
aerodynamic solutions in the sleek and powerful
lines typical of our cars. The interiors of our cars
seek to balance functionality, aesthetics and
comfort. Cockpits are designed to maximize the
driving experience, tending towards more sporty
or more comfortable, depending on the model.
The interiors of our vehicles boast elegant and
sophisticated trims and details that enhance

the ergonomic layout of all main controls, many
of which are clustered on the steering wheel.

A guiding principle of our design is that each
new model represents a clear departure from
prior models and introduces new and distinctive
aesthetic elements, delivering constant innovation
within the furrow of tradition.

| Exceeding expectations |

For the design of our cars we have relied historically
on Italian coachbuilders such as Carrozzeria
Touring, Vignale, Scaglietti and Pininfarina. These
partnerships helped Ferrari in defining its design
language at the forefront of design advance.

 

Throughout the years this area of excellence has
been recognized repeatedly by a long series of
awards being bestowed upon Ferrari road cars.

In 2010 we established the Ferrari Design Centre,
our in-house design department, with the objective
of improving control over the entire design process
and ensuring long-term continuity of the Ferrari
style. The mission of the Ferrari Design Centre is

to define and evolve the stylistic direction of the
marque, imprinting all new products with a modern
stamp, according to a futuristic, uncompromised
vision. The name and logo “Ferrari Design” denotes
all concepts and works from Ferrari Design Centre
(see “—Intellectual Property”). Ferrari Design handles
all aspects of automotive styling for the Ferrari
road cars product range, encompassing the styling
of all bodywork, external components and interior
trim, applied to series production models for the
GT and sports car range special editions, limited
editions, Iconas, one-off models, concept cars

and some track-only models. Ferrari Design also
includes a Color & Trim unit which manages the
choice of materials and finishes for both exterior
and interior trim and, in addition, is responsible
for the Tailor Made program in conjunction with
the Product Marketing department. Ferrari Design
is also involved in the styling and conceptual
definition of Ferrari branded products produced by
our licensees (see “—Brand Activities”). In 2019, we
created the Advanced Design team, a laboratory
that aims at defining the brand’s design vision,
developing new concepts and formal languages
through so far unexplored methods and tools, and
trying to achieve simplification and formal purity
while staying true to the Ferrari DNA which has
characterized its history.

In September 2018 we opened a new building for the
Ferrari Design Centre, which is our first facility fully
dedicated to the Ferrari Design. The new building
hosts two Ateliers and the Tailor Made department
