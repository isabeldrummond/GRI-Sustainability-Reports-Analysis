FERRARI N.V.

/ Responsible Supply Chain

Ferrari encourages the adoption and sharing of
sustainable practices among our business partners,
suppliers and dealers. All suppliers must respect the
Ferrari Code of Conduct, which includes the set of
values recognized, adhered to and promoted by our
Company. The Code of Conduct was updated to
include specific guidelines relating to the respect of
human rights and conflicts of interest. The Group
made its best effort to ensure that the Code of
Conduct is regarded as a best practice of business
conduct and followed by third parties, including
long lasting relationships and business partners
such as suppliers, dealers, advisors and agents.

The selection of suppliers is based not only on the
quality and competitiveness of their products and
services, but also their adherence to social, ethical
and environmental principles.

Relevant suppliers are assessed through a risk
analysis that aims at identifying critical suppliers,
thanks to a mix of a financial-economical (the first
step of the supplier assessment is always the financial
stability) and industrial assessments. Their growth
capability is analyzed to identify where we need to
support the development of our business partners to
help them meet the requests of the Group.

The Supplier Risk Committee (SRC) meets on a
quarterly basis and, using the data provided by the
Supplier Risk Manager, is responsible for: ensuring
that operational procedures used by Purchasing
Department to qualify new vendors are aligned to
Group Policy and Guidelines; reviewing the situation
of critical suppliers and approving current action
plan and mitigating actions, requesting further
action plans to mitigate risks that could come from
supply relationships or existing critical situations
(e.g. bank guarantees in case of advances to the
supplier for fixed costs such as R&D and tooling);
approving any exceptions, if needed. The approval
of the SRC is binding with regard to supplier
evaluation in case of High Risk suppliers profile.

We have established long lasting relationships with
suppliers that produce key components for our
cars, especially those focusing on innovation. This
synergetic relationship aims at putting together

high-level know-how to develop exclusive best-in-
class solutions for Ferrari. We currently rely on 14
key strategic innovation partners, including for the
supply of transmissions and brakes. We have also
developed strong relationships with other industrial
partners for bodyworks and chassis manufacturing
and for powertrain and transmissions, among

other things. Pursuant to our make-or-buy strategy,
we generally retain production in-house whenever
we have an interest in preserving or developing
technological know-how or when we believe

that outsourcing would impair the efficiency and
flexibility of our production process. Therefore,

we continue to invest in the skills and processes
required for low-volume production of components
that we believe improve product quality.

Products sold through Ferrari’s wholesale network,
stores (franchised or directly managed) and on our
website are either developed directly or produced
through licensing agreements.

Conflict minerals

Ferrari supports the goal of preventing the
exploitation of minerals violating human rights.

As part of Ferrari’s commitment to respect and
promote human rights and the sustainability of its
operations, Ferrari selects suppliers based not only
on the quality and competitiveness of their products
and services, but also on their adherence to social,
ethical and environmental principles, as outlined

in Ferrari’s Code of Conduct. Many geopolitical
experts believe that conflicts may increasingly arise
over access to raw materials. For this reason, Ferrari
places a high priority on responsible sourcing and
the integrity of its suppliers.

The cars we produce contain various metals, which
may include tantalum, tin, tungsten and/or gold
(collectively, “3TG” or “Conflict Minerals”).

Ferrari has developed strategies addressing Section
1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as subsequent
rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and
