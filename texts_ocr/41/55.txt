FERRARI N.V.

 

Research, Innovation and Technology

Innovation is in our DNA and we will continue pushing boundaries to respond to

customers’ desires, always setting new standards in the “Ferrari way”

Innovation drives products and processes, which
represents one of our key differentiating factors.
This is why we are focused on developing new
technologies and distinctive designs.

Participation in the Formula 1 World Championship
with Scuderia Ferrari is an important source of
technological innovation, which is then transferred
or adapted into our road cars, such as the hybrid
configuration of the SF90 Stradale. Moreover, our
development efforts take into account the three
defining dimensions of Ferrari cars: performance,
versatility and comfort, as well as driving emotions.
In addition to these internally driven factors,
regulation is key in determining the direction of
technical innovation.

One of our other main focuses is on innovating our
working methods, which involves stimulating the
creativity of our employees. With this in mind, we
have implemented programs designed to encourage
the development of ideas and solutions that will
improve products, methods and the working
environment. Pole Position Evo, for instance,
rewards ideas put forward by individual staff
members. In 2019, we received around 20,000
suggestions from employees, more than doubling
from the previous year.

In recent years, several of our innovations have
been renowned, for instance, by winning the
International Engine of the Year award for four
years in a row (2016 - 2019). Additionally, in 2018,
Ferrari’s engine was voted the best engine of the
past 20 years.

Our focus on excellence requires a strong
collaboration with our suppliers, and a handful

of them are considered “key strategic innovation
partners”. Collaborations with leading universities are
also in place to foster the development of new ideas.

Technological breakthroughs are further enhanced
through design. In 2010, the Ferrari Design Center
was established as a best-in-class in-house design
department to improve control over the design
process and to ensure long-term continuity of the
Ferrari style. A guiding principle of the Ferrari style
is that each new model represents a clear departure
from prior models and introduces new and
distinctive aesthetic elements, delivering constant
innovation within the furrow of tradition. Our
designers, modelers and engineers work together
to create car bodies that incorporate the most
innovative aerodynamic solutions within the elegant
and powerful lines typical of Ferrari cars.

The Design team has been presented with several
design awards such as the “Red Dot: Best of the
Best” award, which was granted for five years in a
row (2015 - 2019).

We continue to regularly launch new cars with
enhanced technological innovations and design
improvements. Our plan is to launch 15 new models
between 2019-2022, 5 of which were unveiled
during 2019, with the purpose of maintaining the
product portfolio’s leading position and to respond
quickly to market demand and technological
breakthroughs. A clear example of this is the SF90
Stradale, our first hybrid series-production car.
