FERRARI N.V.

Parts

We supply parts for current and older models of
Ferrari to our authorized dealer network. In addition
to substitution of spare parts during the life of the
car, sales are driven by clients’ demand for parts to
customize their cars and maximize performance,
particularly after a change in ownership and to
compete in the Ferrari Challenge and other client
races. We also supply parts to Ferrari models
currently out of production, with stocks dating back
to 1995. The stock of parts for even older models is
currently owned and managed by a third party which
in some cases also manufactures out-of-stock parts
based on our design. The sale of parts is a profitable
component of our product mix and it is expected to
benefit from the increase in the number of Ferrari

cars in circulation.

After-sales

Dealers provide after-sales services to clients,

either at facilities adjacent to showrooms, or in
stand-alone service points across 230 facilities
worldwide. After-sales activities are very important
for our business to ensure the client’s continued
enjoyment of the car and the experience. Therefore,
we enforce a strict quality control on our dealers’
services activities and we provide continued training
and support to the dealers’ service personnel.

This includes our team of “flying doctors,” Ferrari
engineers who regularly travel to service centers to
address difficult technical issues for our clients.

We sell cars together with a scheduled program

of recommended maintenance services in order to
ensure that these cars are maintained to the highest
standards to meet our strict requirements for
performance and safety.

Our 7 Year Maintenance Program (free of charge for
customers since 2011 on any new cars) is offered

to further strengthen customer retention in the
official network and has been coupled with the
possibility to extend the statutory warranty term

68 Sustainability Report 2019

of our standard warranty terms through the Power
warranty coverage program up to the 15" year of
life of the car.

After the 7" year of life, a car (if in perfect
maintenance condition) can be included in

the Main Power warranty coverage program
(Maintenance and Power) through to the car’s 15"
year of life. Between the 10° year of life and the
Classiche eligibility (20 year old car) Ferrari provides
its customers, in addition to standard maintenance
items, also certain specific maintenance kits (Ferrari
Premium) to preserve car performance and safety
systems. When a car follows the full maintenance
program up to the 20" year of life, it automatically
obtains the Ferrari Classiche certification.

While we do not have any direct involvement in
pre-owned car sales, we seek to support a healthy
secondary market in order to promote the value of
our brand, benefit our clients and facilitate sales of
new cars. Our dealers provide an inspection service
for clients seeking to sell their car which involves
detailed checks on the car and a certification on
which the client can rely, covering, among other
things, the authenticity of the car, the conformity
to original technical specifications, and the state
of repair. Furthermore, we offer owners of classic
Ferrari cars maintenance and restoration services
through the 73 “Officina Ferrari Classiche”
workshops, part of our service network.

In addition, owners of our classic cars can seek
assistance in car and engine restorations at our
Ferrari Classiche department in Maranello.
