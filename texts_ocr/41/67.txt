FERRARI N.V.

/ GT Racing activities

These track activities reach their climax at the Finali
Mondiali, an annual gathering of all Ferrari client racing
programs under Corse Clienti, which last year took
place from October 24 to 27 at the Mugello Circuit

to celebrate the winners of the Challenge Series. The
new Ferrari 488 Challenge EVO and 488 GT3 EVO
were unveiled to our sporting customers from all over
the world, while over the weekend 43,000 spectators
in the stands were treated to the traditional Ferrari
Show, with the 488 GTE celebrating 70 years of Ferrari
victories at Le Mans, and the F60 celebrating the 90th
anniversary of Scuderia Ferrari.

During the 2019 season, the Competizioni GT
department supported both the Ferrari 488 GTE
and the Ferrari GT3 cars that competed in the most
important international championships. The 488
GTE, with a team composed of Alessandro Pier
Guidi, James Calado and Daniel Serra, won the Le
Mans 24 Hours competition in the WEC, and the
same team also won the Petit Le Mans competition,
the last round of the IMSA series. The 488 GT3,
gave clear proof of its exceptional competitiveness
and reliability, allowing Ferrari to grow its
impressive record of victories, with 285 since its
debut and 67 titles across various international
series. In 2019 the new program, Club Competizioni
GT, was successfully launched. The initiative is

aimed at bringing back to the track the most
beautiful Ferrari GT racing cars of the last 30 years

 

and is dedicated to clients who love on-track racing
and wish to unleash their cars’ maximum potential,
without short, time-constrained testing sessions and
outside of competitive race settings.

Dealer network

We sell our cars exclusively through a network of
authorized dealers (with the exception of one-

offs and track cars which we sell directly to end
clients). In our larger markets we act as importer
either through wholly owned subsidiaries or, in
China, through a subsidiary partly owned by a local
partner, and we sell the cars to dealers for resale to
end clients. In smaller markets we generally sell the

66 Sustainability Report 2019

cars to a single importer/dealer. We regularly assess
the composition of our dealer network in order to
maintain the highest level of quality. At December
31, 2019, our network comprised 166 dealers
operating 187 points of sale.

We do not presently own dealerships and, while our
strategy does not contemplate owning dealerships,
we retain flexibility to adapt to evolving market
requirements over time.

We believe that our careful and strict selection of the
dealers that sell our cars is a key factor for promoting
the integrity and success of our brand. Our selection
criteria are based on the candidates’ reputation,
financial stability and proven track records. We

are also intent on selecting dealers who are able

to provide a purchase and after-sales experience
aimed at exceeding our clients’ high expectations.
Furthermore, our dealers are committed to promote
and market our cars in a manner intended to
preserve the Ferrari brand integrity and to ensure the
highest level of client satisfaction.

While dealers may hold multiple franchises, we
enjoy a high degree of prominence and level of
representation at each point of sale, where most of
the client interface and retail experience is exclusive
to Ferrari. Our network and business development
team works with all dealers to ensure our operating
standards are met. Our rigorous design, layout and
corporate identity guidelines guarantee uniformity
of the Ferrari image and client interface. Through
our in-house Ferrari Academy we provide training to
dealers for sales, after-sales and technical activities.
This ensures that our dealer network delivers

a consistent level of market leading standards
across diverse cultural environments. We train and
monitor dealers intensively. We collect and observe
data relating to their profitability and financial
health in order to prevent or mitigate any adverse
experience for clients arising from a dealer ceasing
to do business or experiencing financial difficulties.
Our regional representatives visit dealerships
regularly to monitor and measure performance

and compliance with our operating standards. We
have the right to terminate dealer relationships
