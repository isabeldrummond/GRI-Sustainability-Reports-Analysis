Design

Design is a fundamental and

distinctive aspect of our products Our development efforts take

into account the three defining
dimensions of Ferrari cars:
performance; versatility and comfort;
and driving emotions.

These three dimensions variably
interact in our sports and GT cars.

and our brand.

Our designers, modelers and
engineers work together to create car
bodies that incorporate innovation
and tradition. In 2010 we established
the Ferrari Design Centre, our in-

house design department.

Open Innovation

Innovation runs within Ferrari and we are well
aware that partnerships and synergies with external
entities of different sectors have to be established
to face the future challenges of the automotive
industry. By getting access to the most advanced
researches and studies, we aim to develop new
practical solutions for our industrial processes

and technical products. We believe that open
innovation is a proficient tool capable of help us
crossing the boundaries between different sectors
and technologies. Below are just a few examples on
how we lead innovation in our Company.

Ferrari has established partnerships with universities
and research centers to convert the most advanced
theoretical researches, especially in technology,
engineering and computer science, into practical
solutions for our industrial processes. Ferrari

also collaborates with research centers and

other organizations to find common solutions to
technological problems, combining state-of-the-art
expertise from different sectors.

The spreading of cross-fertilization and high-
end know-how between different companies is
becoming more relevant for the emergence of
innovative ideas. Ferrari is one of the founding
members of CRIT, a private company specialized

in the research and analysis of technical and
scientific information and in the development

of research project activities. The aim of CRIT

is to spread collaborative innovation between
different enterprises and to share different needs
and knowledge in order to generate new ideas and
access enabling technologies.

A more fertile environment for innovation could
also be created by generating a virtuous circle
between big companies and start-ups. Ferrari, with
the help of specialized partners, is scouting start-
ups to develop specific innovation projects that will
result in the realization of prototypes.

By working in close contact with key suppliers to
foster innovative solutions and by sharing different
expertise, Ferrari is able to overcome several
challenges in many different fields. An example

of this approach can be found in the partnership
created with suppliers for the realization of a state-
of-the-art 1:1 scale static and dynamic simulator
that is able to replicate the behavior of Ferrari’s
vehicles in all the relevant driving conditions.

Since several added-value ideas are also generated
within our Company, we have launched the

pilot project “Internal Open Innovation” with

the objective of spreading “innovation pills” to
allow access to everyone’s ideas in all technical
