Training and talent development

Along with the need to hire, develop and retain talents, we are aware that we must
manage human capital as a critical resource to achieve the best possible results.

The success, prestige and appeal of our brand
depends on the ability to attract talents and

retain them. In particular, top drivers, racing
management, engineering talent and all the
employees that make Ferrari unique have to be
rewarded, based on their ability, determination, and
expectations. This is why we offer career progression
opportunities tailored to each individual’s strength
and ambition, and our Company’s requirements,
underpinned by substantial investments in training.
A total of over 57,600 hours (up 11.8% vs. 2018)

of training have been provided right across the
Company’s employees in 2019. What makes
Ferrari’s craftsmanship unique is the direct transfer
of knowledge and expertise from senior to junior
workers, which in our manufacturing process

takes place directly on the job since we believe in
constantly maintaining excellence through “learning
by doing”.

More than 5 7, 6 0 0 hours of training

delivered across the Company’s employees in 2019,
up 11.8% vs. 2018

Human capital development ensures that our
Company has the appropriate skill set to execute the
business strategy and improve employee attraction,
retention, as well as motivation, and, as a result,
enhance productivity and the quest for innovation.
Training requests, for employees who receive a
regular performance and career development
review, are identified during this review process in
order to address the needs of both our Company
and employees.

A Training Plan with three specific objectives
is in place:

To protect and pass on the strategic and specific
know-how of Ferrari

Among all training initiatives, in Ferrari we are very
proud of our “Scuola dei mestieri”, started in 2009.
It is a unique in-house technical training project
which increases the professionalism of junior talents
and motivates senior employees, recognizing their
competencies by asking them to become Maestri
and pass on Ferrari’s unique heritage to the next
generation. The initiative combines different
didactic methodologies, including on the job
sessions and in-classroom training, both focused on
the consolidation of competencies and skills, with a
particular focus on innovation.

While the Maestri transfer their know-how to

other employees, we have also internally developed
the “Department Team Leaders”, who are expert
workers in our R&D and Manufacturing processes.
In the last few years, we have decided to invest
strongly in the team leaders’ professional and soft
skills. We are creating a cross-functional group with
the objective to become the point of reference for
the rest of the team. Department Team Leaders
(now around 125 employees) are also responsible
for the Pit Stop and Pole Position programs among
their shift colleagues.

In 2019, we consolidated the activities started

in the previous year, with the three main areas

of focus being: product innovation (mainly

with regard to hybridization, HMI and new
components, in a cross functional training),
process innovation (as in the case of low bake
painting and additive manufacturing) as well

as support and induction of new colleagues.
Additionally, in 2019 we started a specific training
focusing on managerial and organizational skills
necessary to meet our strategic plan.
