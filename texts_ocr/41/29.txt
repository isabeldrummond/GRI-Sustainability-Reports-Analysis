FERRARI N.V.

/ Formula 1 Activities

The Team Agreements cover the 2013-2020 racing
seasons and govern the terms by which the racing
teams take their share of commercial profits.

 

The FIA sets both the sporting and technical
regulations for the competitions. In return for
their participation in Formula 1 races the teams
receive a share of a prize fund based on the
profits earned from Formula 1 related commercial
activities managed by FOWC, including in
particular, television broadcasting royalties and
other sources. Shares in the prize fund are paid to
the teams, largely based on the relative ranking of
each team in the championship. We use our share
of these payments to defray part of the costs
associated with Scuderia Ferrari, including the
costs of designing and producing the race cars
each year and the costs associated with managing
a racing team including the salaries of the drivers,
who are typically among the most highly paid
athletes in the world. New regulations were
introduced in 2019, relating to aerodynamics,
drivers’ weight, fuel allowance and the
requirement for drivers to wear biometric gloves
for additional safety. The discussions to establish
the sport’s regulations which will apply from 2021
onwards continued during 2019. The new rules
were approved by the World Council on October
31, 2019, with the understanding that they will be
subject to further discussions between F1, the FIA
and the teams over the coming months, which
may lead to further changes between now and
2021. Please see 2019 Annual Report

“Risk Factors—Our revenues from Formula 1 activities
may decline and our related expenses may grow”.

Improvements in technology and, from time to
time, changes in regulation require the design

and production of a new racing car every year.
Therefore, in addition to our long-term research
and development efforts, we begin designing our
cars each year in the Spring, in anticipation of the
start of the racing season the following March.
While the chassis we build each year are designed to
be used throughout the racing season, the majority
of other components fitted on our cars are adjusted
from race to race depending on the characteristics
of the circuits.

28 Sustainability Report 2019

To maximize the performance, efficiency and safety
of our Formula 1 cars, while complying with the
strict technical rules and restrictions set out by the
FIA, our research and development team plays a key
role in the development of our road cars and their
engines. We often transfer technologies initially
developed for racing to our road cars. Examples
include steering wheel paddles for gear-shifting,

the use and development of composite materials,
which makes cars lighter and faster, and technology
related to hybrid propulsion.

Our road cars (especially our sports car models)
have benefited from the know-how acquired in the
wind tunnel by our racing car development teams,
enjoying greater stability as they reach high speeds
on and off the track. Our research and development
team focused on combining minimal lap times
with maximum efficiency, leading to advances in
kinetic energy recovery system, or ERS, technology.
Current advanced ERS features two electric motor/
generator units in every car, which allow the car to
recover, store and deploy energy generated both by
the vehicle during braking and by the exhaust gases
through a turbocharger.

The high brand visibility we achieve through
Participation in the Formula 1 World
Championship has historically enabled us to
benefit from significant sponsorship. Philip Morris
International has been Scuderia Ferrari’s partner
for over forty years and currently remains our Title
Partner. Starting from October 2018, the “Mission
Winnow” logo has appeared on the cars’ livery
and drivers’ overalls. Mission Winnow is a Philip
Morris International global campaign aimed at
driving change by constantly searching for better
ways of doing things. Shell has also been a long
term Sponsor and Technical Partner of Scuderia
Ferrari (supporting the team continuously since
1996).

The other partners of the Team are divided into
three different categories (Sponsor, Official
Supplier and Supplier) and include Ray-Ban,
Kaspersky lab, UPS, Lenovo, Weichai, Mahle,
Hublot, AMD, OMR and Alfa Romeo among
others. Visibility and placement of a sponsor’s
