Personalization Program
“Carrozzeria Scaglietti”

With our “Special Equipment” program,

we offer clients additional customization

choices for their cars. Our specialists are able

to guide clients in creating a very customized

car through a wide catalog of special items

such as different types of rare leathers, custom
stitching, special paints, special carbon fiber, and
personalized luggage sets designed to match the
car’s interior.

The “Tailor Made” program provides an additional
level of personalization in accordance with the
expectations of our clients. A dedicated Ferrari
designer assists clients in selecting and applying
virtually any specific design element chosen by the

option, various door panel configurations, steering
wheel inserts and state of the art custom high
fidelity sound systems. Commencing with the the
SF90 Stradale, we have also introduced the “Assetto
Fiorano” configuration, which provides numerous
exclusive features for those who seek radical
performance and design.
