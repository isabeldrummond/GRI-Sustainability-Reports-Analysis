attendees including clients, prospective clients,
and fans.

In November 2019, clients were invited to the Stadio
dei Marmi in Rome for the world premiere of the
new Ferrari Roma, an event in the “La Nuova Dolce
Vita” spirit of the new luxury model.

Driving events

Driving events serve the dual objective of allowing
clients to enjoy the best emotions of driving a
Ferrari, and to foster client loyalty and repeat
purchases by creating enhanced opportunities to
experience new Ferrari cars. The Ferrari community
is a passionate group supported by a wide array of
experiences tailored to the dreams of modern car
owners, classic car connoisseurs, and racetrack
enthusiasts.

We see nurturing our clients’ passion for driving

as a key asset for our future commercial success,
particularly in markets where racing traditions are
less pronounced. We offer to our prospective and
existing clients interested in new Ferrari models our
Esperienza Ferrari program, which consists of driving
sessions with a team of highly qualified and skilled
Ferrari instructors and technicians. In addition we
also offer to our clients on-track driving courses
(Corso Pilota), catering to different levels of skill

and experience and teaching essential driving skills
for high performance cars. In our newer markets,
such as China, we also offer complimentary driving
courses on-track to any new car buyer.

In addition to on-track racing, we organize various
on-the-road driving events, both under proprietary
formats (Ferrari Cavalcade, including the Cavalcade
Classiche and the International Edition) and with our own

| Exceeding expectations |

branded presence within established driving events.
For example, in the Ferrari Tribute to Mille Miglia and
the Ferrari Tribute to Targa Florio modern Ferrari cars
take part in their own dedicated competition before
the start of the main racing events.

Another exclusive driving experience was initiated
in October 2019, led by experts of the Ferrari
Classiche Academy, and aimed at classic car
enthusiasts and clients interested in learning more
about Ferrari’s Classiche certification program
and the storied archives at our Officine Classiche
restoration department. The initiative also offers
the opportunity to experience on-track driving of
these celebrated models on our own Fiorano

race circuit.

GT Racing activities

In addition to several track day activities, organized
by local sales departments and dealers to allow
clients to enjoy their cars on ad-hoc rented tracks,
Ferrari has a central department responsible for
professionally organizing races and racing courses,
Corse Clienti. The Corse Clienti activities take place
on some of the world’s most famous race tracks,
and include both competitive races, such as the
Ferrari Challenge Championships (Europe, UK,
North America and the Asia-Pacific series), and
non-competitive events, such as with XX Programme
and F1Clienti activities, dedicated to clients who

own respectively, non-homologated GT laboratory
cars and F1 single-seaters previously used by the
Scuderia Ferrari in the Formula 1 Championship.
Ferrari Challenge and XX Programme/F1 Clienti
events are run together in the so-called Ferrari Racing
Days, which are open to the public and intended for
a wider audience, and in 2019 were held in Laguna
Seca, Shanghai and Nurburgring.
