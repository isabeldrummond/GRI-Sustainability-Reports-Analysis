During the course of 2019, no injuries have been
recorded for agency workers in the Maranello and
Modena plants, and Mugello racing circuit.

During the last year, no cases of diseases arising from
a work situation or activity, or from a work-related
injury have been recorded. Due to the nature of the
activity conducted in Ferrari plants, workers are not
considered exposed to high risks relating to specific
diseases. Regularly, every employee undergoes a work-
related medical examination, as prescribed by law.
