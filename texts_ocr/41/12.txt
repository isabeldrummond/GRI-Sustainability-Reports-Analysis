Creating and Sharing value within the community:
encourage strategic partnerships and the creation
of positive externalities for all stakeholders

Ferrari is a global Group with deep roots in the
Motor Valley community and our first goal is to
promote activities designed to fuel education.

Its longstanding relationship with the local area
extends to schools, such as, for example, the
Alfredo Ferrari Technical High School in Maranello,
which it supports and with which it shares work
commencement and orienteering projects. Ferrari
is also involved with the MUNER (Motorvehicle
University of Emilia-Romagna) Project which pools
the knowledge of the various universities of Emilia
Romagna and the know-how of Motor Valley’s
leading companies. Ferrari’s relationship with the
local area is also further strengthened by the two
Ferrari Museums which attracted over 600,000
visitors to Modena and Maranello in the course of
the year, acting as a driver for the tourist industry in
the entire area.

The Group’s commitment to education also
quite literally took physical shape in the Istituto

| Our Journey to Sustainability |

Omnicomprensivo school building in Amatrice
which was officially opened last November by
Chairman John Elkann and named in honour of
the late Sergio Marchionne. Ferrari provided a
large part of the funds required for its construction
by auctioning a LaFerrari after the earthquake
devastated Central Italy in 2016.

As a hugely iconic brand all over the world, Ferrari
also aims to make its presence felt beyond Italy’s
borders. Once again, the focus is on education
through a network of relationships with prestigious
universities whose students are given the
opportunity to collaborate with the company on
degree theses, doctoral dissertations and research
projects.

Ferrari is using these five pillars to pursue its
development in a manner open to innovation and
the sharing of ideas and projects to help both its
employees and technology growing and flourish.

In other words, development in which sustainability
plays an essential role in mapping out the
Company’s future but also that of the car sector as
a whole.
