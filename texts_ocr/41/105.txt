FERRARI N.V.

Vehicle’s end of life

We are not directly involved in product take back
programs due to the nature of our business: the
number of Ferrari cars demolished each year is very
scarce as Ferrari cars are perceived as collectibles,
which the Group also supports through its “Ferrari
Classiche” services, and the active preowned
market.

The Ferrari Classiche department aims to provide
Ferrari customers with a point of reference for
managing their historic Ferrari vehicles with the
objective of keeping as many of these classic

cars on the road as possible. Services include the
certification of the authenticity of classic Ferrari
cars and vehicles of particular historical relevance,
the management of Ferrari restoration and repair
activities, as well as the management of Ferrari
spare parts, including when these are no longer
available on the market. The department also
provides advice on repair operations carried out on
Ferrari Classiche cars within its network.

Ferrari Classiche aims to create a platform of
information and technical expertise to preserve

and enhance over time the awareness and value of
Ferrari’s heritage and brand. We view the surviving
Ferrari vehicles of historical value as the tangible
legacy and incarnation of our brand. The Ferrari
Classiche department also supports and encourages
the direct participation of clients in strategic
historical events.

The Ferrari Classiche department in Maranello
consists of an office of specialists and a workshop
in which historic cars are restored and repaired. In
addition, in order to provide an enhanced service
to owners away from the proximity of the main
workshop in Maranello, starting in 2017 Ferrari
Classiche authorized a new service network with
73 “Officina Ferrari Classiche” workshops to date,
primarily for vehicle repairs and the certifications’
inspections or revalidation, and the network is
expected to expand in future periods.

104 Sustainability Report 2019

The originality of the car with respect to the

initial specifications is checked via a technical
inspection, performed either at the Ferrari
Classiche facility in Maranello or at an authorized
Officina Ferrari Classiche, and benefits from a
comprehensive archive containing drawings of each
of the individual chassis and details of historical
components. Based on the evidence gathered
during this inspection, the car is then presented to
an expert committee, chaired by the founder’s son,
Piero Ferrari, for the certification.

At the Maranello workshop, Ferrari Classiche
carries out full restorations using either original
components and spare parts or replicas
manufactured in accordance with the original
specifications. Our service offers our clients the
opportunity to restore any classic Ferrari to its
original pristine conditions.

The Ferrari Classiche department also provides
basic technical and instructional support to the
Ferrari Classiche Academy, a new driving school
project that launched in 2019 for vintage Ferrari
cars, including the Ferrari 308 and 550 Maranello.
