FERRARI N.V.

 

Production Process

Our production facilities are located in Maranello
and in Modena, Italy (see “—Properties”). Our
production processes include supply chain
management, production and distribution logistics
of cars in our range models and special series, as
well as assembly of prototypes and avanseries.

Notwithstanding the low volumes of cars produced,
our production process requires a great variety

of inputs - over 40,000 product identifier codes
sourced from approximately 750 total suppliers

- entailing complex supply chain management

to ensure continuity of production. Our stock

of supplies is warehoused in Ubersetto, near
Maranello, and its management is outsourced to a
third party logistics company.

62 Sustainability Report 2019

Most of the manufacturing process takes place in
Maranello, including aluminum alloy casting in our
foundry, engine construction, mechanical machining,
painting, car assembly, and bench testing; at our
second plant in Modena (Carrozzeria Scaglietti) we
manufacture our cars’ aluminum bodyworks. All
parts and components not produced in house at
Ferrari are sourced from our panel of suppliers.

Unlike most low volume car producers, we operate
our own foundry and machining department
producing several of the main components of our
engines, such as engine blocks, cylinders heads and
crankshafts. We believe this accelerates product
development and results in components that meet
our specifications more closely.
