| Proactively fostering best practice governance

We believe that we compete primarily thanks to our brand image, the performance and design of our cars,

our reputation for quality and the driving experience we offer our customers.

Risk management and Compliance

 

Quality and safety of products and customers

 

Supply chain responsible management

 

Health and safety

Key risks and risk trends

NON-COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, REGULATIONS,
LOCAL STANDARDS (INCLUDING TAX) AND CODES

 

We are subject to comprehensive and constantly evolving laws, regulations and policies throughout the

world. In Europe, United States and China, for example, significant governmental regulation is driven by

environmental, fuel economy, vehicle safety and noise emission concerns, and regulatory enforcement has

become more active in recent years.

Human capital

Key risks and risk trends

ATTRACTION, DEVELOPMENT AND
RETENTION OF TALENTS

 

Our success depends on the ability of our senior
executives and other members of management to
effectively manage individual areas of the business
and our business as a whole. If we are unable to
attract, retain and incentivize senior executives,
drivers, team managers and key employees to
succeed in international competitions or devote the
capital necessary to fund successful racing activities,
new models and innovative technology, this may
adversely affect the potential enthusiasm of Ferrari
clients for the brand and their perception of our cars,
which could have an adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

A detailed description of how we respond to
these risks can be found in the section “Risk, Risk
Management and Control Systems” of the 2019
Annual Report.

Responsible Supply Chain

Our focus on excellence, in terms of luxury,
quality, aesthetics and performance, requires us
to implement a responsible and efficient supply
chain management in order to select suppliers
and partners that are able to meet our high
standards. Notwithstanding the low volume

of cars manufactured, our production process
requires a great variety of inputs entailing a
complex supply chain management to ensure
continuity of production. We source a variety of
components (among which transmissions, brakes,
driving-safety systems and others), raw materials
(such as aluminum or special steel), supplies,
utilities, logistics and other services from numerous
suppliers.
