INDEX

We require all franchisees to operate our
monobrand stores according to our standards.
Stores are designed, decorated, furnished

and stocked according to our directions and
specifications.

We use multiple criteria to select our franchisees,
including know-how, financial condition, sales
network and market access. Generally, we require
that applicants meet certain minimum working
capital requirements and have the requisite
business facilities and resources. We typically
enter into a standard franchising agreement with
our franchisees. Pursuant to this agreement, the
franchisee is authorized to sell our products at

a suggested retail price. In exchange, we provide
them with our products, the benefit of our
marketing platform and association with our

corporate identity.

Brand Diversification Strategy

In November 2019, management presented the
principles of its brand diversification strategy,
recognizing Ferrari as a unique brand with a dual
identity: exclusive, but also inclusive in relation to our
F1 fan communities. To ensure long term profitable
growth, Ferrari intends to focus its offering on
product categories that enhance the vibrancy and
vitality of the brand through the following pillars:

* “Brand Extension” pillar, a refined collection of
products that will embody Ferrari’s DNA;

° “Entertainment” pillar, to reach out to a wider
and younger customer base while leveraging
Ferrari’s unique racing roots; and

* “Car Adjacencies” pillar, a collection of exclusive
luxury products and services to complement the
Ferrari experience.
