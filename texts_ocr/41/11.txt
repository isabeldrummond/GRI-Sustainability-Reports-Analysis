FERRARI N.V.

/ Our Journey to Sustainability

Being the employer of choice: provide an
inclusive, educational and inspiring work
environment to unleash everyone’s passion,
creativity and talent.

Behind every Company’s success story are the men
and women who work there every day. In Ferrari,
the pursuit of excellence in its products goes hand-
in-glove with the pursuit of a quality working life,
the wellbeing and the professional development of
our employees. In recent years, this has been the
fulcrum of a growing number of specific, carefully
crafted programmes.

The first programme targets skills development

as the prerequisite for successfully tackling future
challenges. Last year, we achieved a record of over
57,600 hours of training, an increase of 12% on
2018. The educational options on offer also grew
in parallel due to our partnership with Harvard
Business School, which has made one of the most
advanced online learning platforms in the world
available to our employees.

Another area of Ferrari excellence is its wellbeing
and welfare programme for employees and

their families. This spans a series of services

and opportunities ranging from study grants to
recreational activities and free medical visits as
part of “Formula Benessere”. The latter was further
extended in 2019 with “Formula Benessere Donna”
specifically designed for women. In the course

of the year, Ferrari employees and their children
availed themselves of over 4,500 medical and
specialist check-ups.

Reducing environmental footprint: increase our

environmental awareness to continuously set and
implement related programs and actions.

10 Sustainability Report 2019

With the presentation in May 2019 of the SF90
Stradale, Ferrari’s first production hybrid model,
we embarked upon a new phase of hybridising

the range. On the one hand, this technological
solution ensures Ferrari complies with both legal
requirements and the desire to combat emissions
shared with our clients, while on the other, it will
raise the driving pleasure and fun behind the wheel
that makes our car unique to new heights.

Our commitment to reducing our environmental
impact is nothing new, however, and has already
produced impressive results. In 2019, the Group
achieved its objective of reducing the CO, emissions
of its European fleet by 35% compared to 2007
levels. We are now aiming for an even more
ambitious target of reducing emissions by 15%
compared to 2014 across the entire fleet by 2020.

In 2019, Ferrari delivered another important result
which saw it decouple its economic growth from
the carbon footprint of its premises in Maranello
and Modena. The CO, emissions of those premises
remained generally on a par with the previous
year, despite a net increase in output. This was

as a result of investment in plant, the application
of circular economy principles to certain
processes, and meticulous management of energy
requirements. 87% of the latter were also covered
by the trigeneration system in Maranello, while
almost 95% of the remaining energy shortfall was
purchased from certified renewable sources.

That said, we have no intention of resting on our
laurels with these results. In the course of 2020,
we will begin calculating our carbon footprint on
a subset of products and processes, an essential
factor in tackling our goal to become ultimately
carbon neutral over the longer term.
