FERRARI N.V.

Privacy and data protection

Customer personal data and information is one of
Ferrari’s cornerstones and a key component of our
competitive advantage.

We care about processing personal data in a safe
and transparent manner, as it is a fundamental part
of our accountability towards our customers. We
strive for safeguarding our network against security
risks and incidents, preventing cyberattacks in order
to guarantee the security and confidentiality of our
Customers’ information.

We act in accordance with the current legislative
framework that governs the processing of our
personal data at global scale, including but not
limited to the General Data Protection Regulation
“GDPR” (EU Regulation no. 2016/679).

Data protection law requires, among others,
the application of increased transparency
obligations, the introduction of common records

of processing activities, the appointment of a

Data Protection Officer “DPO” and - where
advisable - privacy impact assessments before
processing personal data.

Within this context, we have adopted a progressive
approach to ensure compliance with data
protection and privacy law requirements, such as
the implementation of ICT and security systems
(e.g. system collecting consents and privacy notices,
back-end systems managing direct personal data
etc.), the enhancement of internal policies and
procedures (e.g. data breach policy, data retention
policy etc.), the guarantee of an effective and
prompt response to requests from data subjects,
the update of privacy notices, drafting of operating
instructions for authorized persons within the
Company as well as the designation of internal
privacy referents within Company departments.

Regular training sessions, aimed at raising the
awareness on the data privacy regulations and
requirements, are organized and addressed to
those employees involved in the processing of
personal data.
