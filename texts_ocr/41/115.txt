Ferrart Driver Academy

The Ferrari Driver Academy was founded with
the aim of providing young drivers with a training
program that will ultimately reward them with a
career in a F1 Prancing Horse car.

The Ferrari Driver Academy focuses on fostering
the growth and training of talented young drivers
who are hand-picked from the international motor
racing arena. The aim is to provide these drivers
with a 360-degree preparation for a future in the
world of Formula 1 or GT racing. In addition,

the project also encompasses initiatives designed
to promote motorsport in Italy and abroad with
partnerships to support youth championships in
Europe, America and Asia.

The first driver to enter the program was Jules
Bianchi in December 2009. The Academy’s line-

up for 2020 will count nine drivers: Giuliano Alesi,
Callum Ilott, Mick Schumacher, Marcus Armstrong,
Robert Shwartzman, Enzo Fittipaldi, Arthur Leclerc,
Gianluca Petecof and Dino Beganovic. Charles

Leclerc joined at the beginning of 2016 and within
two years won the GP3 and F2 championships.

Two years ago, he raced in Formula One with Alfa

Romeo Sauber and from 2019 he is racing for
Scuderia Ferrari as an official Driver.

 

The Ferrari Driver Academy’s mission is to train

drivers, not merely from a racing point of view, but
also to develop them personally and professionally
through a program that spans several years. The
focus is on developing both the person and the
professional at a time in their life when they are
growing rapidly, by providing them with all the
required tools to make the right choices at the right
time. Hence the idea of creating a “Campus” where
the young drivers can live and breathe motorsport
and, even more importantly, Ferrari, 24 hours a day.

In 2019, we had a successful year in Formula
3 Championship, with Robert Schwartzman
clinching the title and Marcus Armstrong
obtaining second place.
