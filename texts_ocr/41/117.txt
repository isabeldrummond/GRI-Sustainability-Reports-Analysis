Methodology and scope

Through our Sustainability Report, we aim to
provide our stakeholders with non-financial
information, illustrate our sustainability strategy
and our corporate social responsibility initiatives
in 2019 (from January 1%, 2019 to December
31%, 2019) to ensure transparent and structured
communication with our stakeholders.

This Sustainability Report was prepared under
the supervision of Ferrari Group’s Chief Financial
Officer, in compliance with the “GRI Sustainability
Reporting Standards” established in 2016 by GRI
- Global Reporting Initiative, and in accordance
with the GRI Standards: Core option. Several
operating departments of the Group have been
actively involved in the process of data gathering
and report drafting, in order to shape this
Sustainability Report. This has been shared with
the Executive Officers of the Group and with the
Governance and Sustainability Committee of the
Board of Directors.

With regard to the financial data, the scope of
reporting corresponds to that of Ferrari N.V.’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regarding the qualitative and quantitative data

on social and environmental aspects, the scope

of reporting corresponds to Ferrari N.V. and our
subsidiaries consolidated on a line-by-line basis
(as indicated in the note 3 “Scope of consolidation”
of 2019 Annual Report). Environmental data

and information is reported for our principal
manufacturing facility in Maranello, for our second

116 Sustainability Report 2019

plant in Modena and for our Mugello racing
circuit. Any exceptions, with regard to the scope
of this data, are clearly indicated throughout the
Sustainability Report.

Directly measurable quantities have been

included, while limiting, as far as possible, the

use of estimates. Any estimated data is indicated
accordingly, additionally certain totals in the tables
included in this document may not add due to
rounding.

During the reporting period, we did not face any
significant change concerning the organization’s

size, structure, ownership or supply chain.

The reporting frequency will be annual.

 

The Report is subject to a limited assurance
engagement in accordance with the criteria
established by the principle ISAE 3000 (Revised) by
EY S.p.A, which, at the end of the work performed,
released the Independent Auditors’ Report.
