Innovation principles

We believe there are five key guidelines to innovation
at Ferrari:

1.

Focus on the three key
defining dimensions
previously described
above

2.
Leveraging on
Formula 1
know-how

3.

First mover positioning
in core areas such
powertrain and
aerodynamics

4.

Customization of
technologies available
on the market

(such as the turbo
technology)

5.

Pursuit of synergies
(arising from common
architectures within our range)

In addition to these internally driven factors,
regulation is key in determining the direction of
innovation.

Combustion engines

We believe internal combustion engines will
remain important in Ferrari’s powertrain mix
and therefore we continue to invest significantly
in new combustion engine technologies and the
development or use of bio-fuels. In 2018 we won
the “Engine of the Year” award for the newest
edition of our V8 turbocharged engine mounted
on the 488 Pista.

Going forward, Ferrari will have three engine
families: we will maintain and develop the V12
naturally aspirated engine family, long the pinnacle
of Ferrari engines; we will implement the next
technological step ups for the V8 family; and we
will develop a completely new V6 family based on a
specific and innovative architecture.

The industry effort to combine greater power
outputs with lower emissions and consumption
often leads to a higher turbo lag. Through a
technological breakthrough, Ferrari has engineered
a turbo engine with turbo engine performance but
with the response of a naturally aspirated engine.
For example, the specific power output of the 488
Pista was increased to 184 horsepower without
meaningful turbo lag.

In the future, we intend to use hybrid and electric
technology, as well as Formula 1 technology, to
increase specific power output without turbo lag.

We are deploying considerable resources for the
development of hybrid and electric powertrains,
which will be mounted on an increasingly larger
proportion of our car models; this is intended to
improve performance and driving experience while
also satisfying customer preferences and regulatory
requirements regarding emissions. With the SF90
Stradale we developed the first series production
car in our range with Plug-in-Hybrid Electric Vehicle
(PHEV) technology.
