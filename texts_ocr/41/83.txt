Talent Recruitmentand Employee Retention

The excellence, that our products and our brand embody, ts what attracts and retains

the best talents worldwide.

At Ferrari, recruitment and selection is about sourcing
the right qualities and skills that will represent the
backbone of our future success. Our recruitment
process provides a platform to engage with future
employees, to assess competencies through a
structured selection process and to prepare for post-
recruitment integration and development.

The mission of the recruitment team is to identify,
evaluate and bring onboard the individuals which
are aligned with our requirements and values

We received in excess of 45,000 applications during
2019, including specific as well as spontaneous
applications from around the world for engineering,
technical, marketing and financial positions.

We also undertake exchange programs with top
universities around the world to engage with
students, professors, career offices and a network
of professionals in order to identify talents for the
future. We offer company insight presentations,
testimonials by Ferrari staff, selected case studies
at university campus and, for partner universities
we offer the opportunity to visit the Ferrari
facilities. These activities allow us to transmit the
key values of the company, and therefore to engage
directly, or indirectly through communications
and social media, nourishing our recruitment
pipeline. In 2019, alongside our graduate project
“Ferrari F1 Engineering Academy”, active since
2015, we launched three more Academy programs:
“Ferrari GT Manufacturing Academy”, “Ferrari
GT Engineering Academy” and “Ferrari GT
Marketing and Sales Academy” with dedicated
communication at universities, integrating on-line
testing as well as dedicated assessment centers
managed in Maranello to ensure that the most

suitable applicants have the opportunity to join
the Ferrari team.

To ease employees into their new jobs, Ferrari
provides a two-day induction program. The first day
is dedicated to introducing the Company culture
and mission, as well as guiding new employees
through the corporate offices and production
plants. The following day is focused on health and
safety training.

To promote a responsible behavior during

the assembling phase of cars and engines, we
launched many years ago the “Pit Stop” and
“Fiorano Race” initiatives, where colleagues on

the same shift are assigned to “teams”, with key
performance indicators in place for the improvement
of quality, efficiency and environmental sustainability.
The teams are then ranked based on the data, with
the best performers being rewarded. Furthermore, we
organize the “Pole Position Evo” program to evaluate
individual performances.

We reward our employees, excluding senior
management, through a productivity bonus called
“Premio di Competitivita” based on yearly shipments
and adj. EBITDA results, as well as a product quality
index adjusted for individual absenteeism rates. In
2019, each employee received around Euro 5,500.

A huge part of our employees receive a regular
performance review based on performance and
leadership behaviors, which ends with a final
evaluation from their assessors at the end of the
year. Workers undergo a different review, which is
based on regular assessments aimed at developing
their internal career path.
