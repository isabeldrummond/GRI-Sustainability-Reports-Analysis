FERRARI N.V.

Ferrari Line-Up Strategic Pillars

Our product offering comprises four main strategic
pillars: the sports range, the GT range, special series
and Icona. Our current product range includes

five sports cars, four GT cars and two special

series cars, as well as our Icona cars, introduced

in September 2018 with the Ferrari Monza SP1

and SP2. We target end clients seeking high
performance cars with distinctive design and state
of the art technology. Our broad model range is
designed to fulfill the strategy of “Different Ferrari
for different Ferraristi, different Ferrari for different
moments”, which means being able to offer a highly
differentiated product line-up that can meet the
varying needs of new customer segments (in terms
of sportiness, comfort, on-board space, design) and
that can allow our existing clients to use a Ferrari in
every moment of their lives. Our diversified product
offering includes different architectures (such as
front-engine and mid-rear engine), engine sizes

(V8 and V12), technologies (atmospheric,
turbo-charged, hybrid, electric), body styles

(such as coupes and spiders), and seats (2 seaters,
2+2 seaters and 4 seaters).

We are also actively engaged in after sales activities
driven, among other things, by the objective of
preserving and extending the market value of the
cars we sell. We believe our cars’ performance

in terms of value preservation after a period of
ownership significantly exceeds that of any other
brand in the luxury car segment. High residual value
is important to the primary market because clients,
when purchasing our cars, take into account the
expected resale value of the car in assessing the
overall cost of ownership. Furthermore, a higher
residual value potentially lowers the cost for the
owner to switch to a new model thereby supporting
client loyalty and promoting repeat purchases.
