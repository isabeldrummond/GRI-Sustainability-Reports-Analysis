Total waste for 2019 was equal to 11,175.4 tons,

in line with 2018, notwithstanding a production
increase. This result was mainly achieved through
two initiatives that were introduced in 2018: the
first is that we started recovering sand from the
foundry to sell it as a by-product to a third party
player that transforms it in a new product, following
a circular economy principle. The second activity is
the use of a longer-lasting cooling lubricant. Since
the inception of these two activities, there has been
a waste reduction of 10.2%.

In September 2019, we removed single-use plastic
in our restaurant, which resulted in a reduction of
plastic waste by 8 tons.

In 2019, the seventh consecutive edition of KiSS
Mugello took place. This is the environmental and
social sustainability program of the Italian Grand
Prix that aims to raise awareness on the importance
of sustainability during major sporting events, as
well as in everyday life.

The main environmental initiatives consisted in

a plan to improve the quantity and quality of
recycling during the Grand Prix: a project to reduce
plastic water bottles, the collection and recovery

of exhausted lubricant and food oils, and a plan to
encourage spectators to use public transport and

shared cars to travel to the circuit. Approximately
39% of waste was recovered during the event.

In collaboration with Banco Alimentare, more than
2,700 meals were collected and donated. A special
and exciting Pit Walk was organized, dedicated
exclusively to local non-profit organizations. KiSS
Mugello has been recognized as one of the best
Practices at international level for sustainability in
sport events by WWF, GREEN SPORT ALLIANCE and
UEFA, who included it in the report “Playing for Our
Planet. How Sports Win from Being Sustainable”. The
Mugello Circuit was the first circuit in the world to
obtain the prestigious “Achievement of Excellence”,
the highest level of environmental sustainability claim
issued by FIA (International Automobile Federation).

Since 2011, the Mugello racing circuit is proactive
in terms of environmental sustainability themes. A
252 kWp photovoltaic system has been installed on
the main tribune, which in 2019 generated almost
150,000 kWh of annual production.

Logistics

We produce all of our vehicles and spare parts

in our Maranello and Modena plants, however,
our network of third party dealers comprises 187
point of sales around the world. A meticulous
work is constantly carried out to optimize logistical
operations with the aim of reducing the impact on
the environment and associated air emissions.

4) For a better reporting of the total waste generated by the Group, waste generated by Ferrari S.p.A. and managed through third-party
warehouses, not included in the previous Report, have been added to 2018 data.
