INDEX

logo reflects the level of sponsorship fees.
Historically, our sponsors have sought advertising
opportunities on the chassis of our cars, on
clothes worn by our team members and drivers,
and in the right to associate their brand to Ferrari
in their marketing activities and communications.

We use the platform provided by Formula 1 fora
number of associated marketing initiatives, such

as the hosting of clients and other key partners

in Ferrari Formula 1 Club Hospitality to watch

and experience the Grand Prix races with Scuderia
Ferrari, and our Formula 1 drivers’ participation in
various promotional activities for our road cars. We
often sell older Formula 1 cars to customers for use
in amateur racing or collection.

More generally, Formula 1 racing allows us

to promote and market our brand and technology
to a global audience without resorting to
traditional advertising activities, therefore
preserving the aura of exclusivity around our brand
and limiting the marketing costs that we, as a
company operating in the luxury industry, would
otherwise incur.

The Mugello Circuit

We acquired the international Mugello circuit in
Scarperia, near Florence, in 1988. We have renovated
its buildings, 5.2 km race track and other testing and
racing facilities, making Mugello what we believe to
be one of the world’s finest circuits of its type, with
FIA Grade 1 and FIM Grade A certifications, the
highest level of homologation for a racetrack.

We promote the Mugello circuit to event organizers
who regularly rent the circuit to host leading car
and motorbike races, including the MotoGP World
Championship since 1992. In 2019, the circuit
hosted 16 race weekends and 250 days of track
activities. Almost 121,000 spectators attended the
2019 MotoGP World Championship (71,000 on the
Sunday), one of the largest audiences ever recorded
in the 29 years of the Mugello circuit’s history.

In 2011, the Mugello circuit won its fifth “Best
Grand Prix” award, the highest honor given in
the motor sport world to MotoGP organizers.
The Mugello circuit is the only track race to have
received this award five times.
