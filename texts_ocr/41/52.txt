Exchange Commission (collectively, the “Conflict
Mineral Rules”), requiring companies to determine
whether 3TG in their supply chain originated

from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
its adjoining countries (collectively, the “Covered
Countries”), and whether the procurement of
those minerals supported the armed conflict in
this region. Due to the complexity of our supply
chain, we are dependent upon suppliers to provide
the information necessary to correctly identify

the smelters and refiners that produce the 3TG
contained in our products and take appropriate
action to determine that these smelters and refiners
source responsibly.

We strive to ensure that legitimate business
activities and the livelihoods of individuals in
Covered Countries are not harmed by our efforts.
To this end, we promote responsible sourcing in
Covered Countries.

In accordance with the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidance,
we have established an internal management
system in relation to the supply of Conflict
Minerals, with the objective, inter alia, of (1)
minimizing the trade in Conflict Minerals that
directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed

| Proactively fostering best practice governance

groups anywhere in the world; and (2) enabling
legitimate minerals from conflict and high risk
regions to enter Ferrari’s global supply chain,
thereby supporting the economies and the local
communities that depend on the export of such
minerals. We have strengthened our engagement
with suppliers, communicating our position on
responsible sourcing and our expectations in terms
of responsible supply chains. In addition, we have
established a control and transparency system
over our 3TG supply chain. Such system includes
surveying our suppliers about the 3TG in their
supply chain.

Among other things, we:

* expect our suppliers to assure that the 3TG in
their products do not directly or indirectly finance
or benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries;
and

* require all of our 3TG suppliers to conduct the
necessary due diligence and provide us with
adequate information on the country of origin
and source of the materials used in the products
they supply to us.

In 2018, 93% of Ferrari’s direct suppliers by
purchased value submitted responses to our survey.
We are strongly committed to increase the coverage
of our analysis and the response rate through
targeted actions.
