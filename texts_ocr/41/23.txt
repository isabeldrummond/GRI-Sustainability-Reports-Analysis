FERRARI N.V.

Special Series

From time to time, we also design, engineer and
produce special series cars which can be limited

in time or volume and are usually based on our
range sports models but introduce novel product
concepts. These cars are characterized by significant
modifications designed to enhance performance
and driving emotions. Our special series cars are
particularly targeted to collectors and, from a
commercial and product development standpoint,
they facilitate the transition from existing to new
range models. Our current special series cars are the
488 Pista, powered by a 720 hp V8 engine, and its
retractable hard top version, the 488 Pista Spider
(720 hp).

Icona

In September 2018, we introduced a new pillar

of our product portfolio: the Icona, a unique
concept that takes inspiration from the iconic cars
of our history and reinterprets them in a modern
fashion, pairing timeless design with state-of-the-
art materials and technology. The first examples of
this strictly limited-edition product line-up are the
Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2, which are inspired by
the classic collectible barchetta cars, the 750Monza
and 860Monza.

Limited Edition Hypercars,
Fuori Serie and One-Off

In line with our tradition of hypercars starting with
the 288GTO in 1984 up to the Enzo in 2002 and
the LaFerrari Aperta, our latest hypercar launched
in 2016, we also produce limited edition hypercars.
These are the highest expression of Ferrari road

car performance at the time and are often the
forerunners of technological innovations for
future range models, with innovative features and
futuristic design. Furthermore, in connection with
certain events or celebrations, we also launch very
limited edition cars (our fuori serie). These models
can be offered globally, or may be limited to specific
local markets. Based on an exotic product concept
not available on the standard Ferrari model range,
these cars feature completely unique design and
specifications compared to our other models.

Finally, in order to meet the varying needs of our
most loyal and discerning clients, we also produce a
very limited number of one-off models. While based
on the chassis and equipped with engines of one

of the current range models for homologation and
registration purposes, these cars reflect the exact
exterior and interior design specifications requested
by the clients, and are produced as a single, unique
car. Some of the most iconic models emerged from
our One-Off program include the SP12 EC (inspired
by the 512 BB and created in 2011), the F12 TRS (a
radical two-seat roadster created on the platform of
the F12berlinetta in 2014), the SP38 (a superlative
mid-rear V8 turbo taking inspiration from the
legendary Ferrari F40), the 458MM Speciale (the last
mid rear model with a V8 natural aspirated engine

in 2016) and the P80/C, a real track car taking
inspiration from past Ferrari Sport Prototipo models.
