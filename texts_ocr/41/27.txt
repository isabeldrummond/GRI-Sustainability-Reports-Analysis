hormula 1 Activities

Participation in the Formula 1 World Championship
with Scuderia Ferrari is the core element of our
marketing effort and an important source of
technological innovation for the engineering,
development and production of our sports, GT

and special series cars. The Formula 1 World
Championship is the pinnacle of motorsports with a
total global TV cumulative audience of 1.922 billion
in 2019, the highest number since 2012, which
represents an increase of 9% compared to 2018. In
terms of unique television viewers, during 2019 the
sport remained stable in the top 20 markets at
approximately 405.5 million (+0.3 percent)

(Source: Formula 1 Press Office).

In 2019 the number of users across Formula 1’s
social media platforms again grew significantly, with
the total number of followers on Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram and YouTube reaching 24.9m (+32.9
percent compared to 2018). Again in 2019, Formula
1’s social media channels were the fastest growing

of all major sports leagues in the world.

Formula 1 cars rely on advanced technology,
powerful hybrid engines and cutting edge
aerodynamics. While Europe is the sport’s
traditional base, longstanding non-European venues
such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico and
the United States have recently been joined by racing
venues in China, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates,
Singapore and Azerbaijan. A new venue in Vietnam
has been launched in 2020, while the Dutch Grand
Prix has returned after several decades. This provides
participants in the Formula 1 World Championship
exceptional visibility on the world stage.

Scuderia Ferrari has been racing in the Formula 1
World Championship since the series was launched

in 1950, and won its first Grand Prix in 1951. We
are the only team that has competed in each season
since launch and the oldest and most successful

in the history of Formula 1, with 238 Grand Prix
wins. Throughout our racing history, we have won
15 Drivers’ Championships and 16 Constructors’
Championships, more than any other team. Many
of the best known drivers in the sport’s history

have raced in Scuderia Ferrari’s distinctive red cars
including Alberto Ascari, Juan-Manuel Fangio, Mike
Hawthorn, Phil Hill, John Surtees, Niki Lauda, Jody
Scheckter, Gilles Villeneuve, Michael Schumacher
and Kimi Raikkonen. Our drivers’ line-up in 2019
comprised four-time World Champion Sebastian
Vettel, who joined Ferrari at the beginning of 2015,
and Charles Leclerc, the first graduate of the Ferrari
Driver Academy training scheme to race for our
Formula 1 race team.

For Scuderia Ferrari, 2019 was very much a year of
reorganization, with many team members taking on
new roles, including Mattia Binotto, who stepped up
to the role of Team Principal, and one half of the driver
line-up was renewed. During the past season, Scuderia
Ferrari achieved three wins, nine pole positions, 19
podiums and 504 points. Its drivers led for a total of
406 laps, approximately a third of the total number of
race laps over the entire season, and the team finished
second in the Constructors’ Championship.

Participation in the Formula 1 World Championship
is regulated by bilateral Team Agreements entered
into between Formula 1 World Championship
Limited (FOWC), Formula 1’s commercial rights
holder, and each competing Formula 1 racing team
(including Scuderia Ferrari) and by regulations issued
by the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile
(FIA), the motorsport’s governing body.
