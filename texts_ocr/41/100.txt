Water management

We are well aware of the importance of a responsible management of water and, even if our plants are not
located in areas exposed to high or extremely high overall water risks"), nor our production process can

be considered water intensive, we have developed a series of initiatives to reduce water consumption in our
manufacturing processes, such as cooling systems with water recirculation (e.g. cooling towers).

All the water sourced comes from municipal water supplies and wells: as of today, no water bodies are
directly affected by the withdrawal of water.

WATER WITHDRAWAL BY SOURCE

Surface water 0 0
Wells 460,230 501,665
Municipal water or other water utilities 166,011 166,900
Total 626,241 668,565

 

We treat our wastewater in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. All the wastewater of our
plants is always monitored and channeled in the public sewage system and not directly into water bodies.
The water used in some of the industrial processes (such as washing solutions or paint washing), before its
discharge in the public sewer system, is treated by an industrial water treatment plant where it undergoes the
necessary chemical, physical, and biological treatments.
