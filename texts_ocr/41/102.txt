Vehicles environmental wmpact

Part of the environmental impact of our activities is related to our product
lifecycle. Ferrari cars are perceived as collectibles and therefore the number of
cars demolished each year is very scarce. In addition, the cars are generally not

considered means of transportation.

Vehicles emissions

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations
that, among others, are related to car emissions
and fuel consumption. Ferrari vehicles must
comply with extensive regional, national and local
laws and regulations, as well as industry self-
regulations (including those that regulate vehicle
safety). However, we currently benefit from certain
regulatory exemptions because we qualify as a Small
Volume Manufacturer or similar designation in
most of the jurisdictions where we sell our cars
(for more details refer to the “Regulatory Matters”
paragraph of 2019 Annual Report).

Ferrari has set a target to reduce CO, emission by 1 5 %
on its entire fleet by 2020 (compared to 2014)

We continue focusing on researching technologies
that further reduced emissions, such as hybrid
engines. We started working with hybrid technology
back in 2011, when we introduced the HY-KERS
(Kinetic Energy Recovery System) technology in our
F1 cars, which was transferred in 2013 to LaFerrari,
our first road car to use hybrid technology. Further
enhancing the hybrid technologies in 2014, we
introduced hybrid power units in our F1 cars and,
in 2019 we launched the SF90 Stradale, our first
hybrid series-production car.

Through innovations in areas such as
turbochargers, engine downsizing, transmission,

electric steering and hybrid technologies, we
continue to target further reductions in CO,
emissions and have set a target to reduce by 2020
CO, emissions by 15%”) (compared to 2014) on our
entire fleet.

Consistent with our mission to develop cutting edge
sports and GT cars, product development efforts
continually focus on improving core components
such as the powertrain, car dynamics and the use
of materials such as special aluminum alloys and
carbon fiber. The expertise acquired in these fields
has recently enhanced our efforts to combine
improved performance with reductions in CO,
emissions.

These efforts, through the investment of huge
resources, allow the reduction of CO, emissions
and fuel consumption thanks to the development
of CO, emission reducing technologies. The

main technologies deployed so far in the Ferrari
fleet are: the 8-gear Dual Clutch Transmission,
optimized smart alternator, brake by wire with
regenerative braking strategy and weight reduction,
improved aerodynamic rims for drag reduction,
gasoline direct injection (200-350 bar), start

& stop with improved direct start, increased
compression ratio, multi-spark ignition, low friction
synchromesh device, downsizing, finger follower
valve actuation with rollers, variable displacement
oil pump with variable feed pressure and smart
cooling (transmission). As an example, in 2015 we

© The target considered the expectations until 2020 of Group’s homologated shipments and the CO2 emissions values according to

requirements set by the European Union.
