termination of numerous licensing agreements and the
exit from merchandise categories that do not reflect
the Company’s inherent values.

We ended the Formula 1 World Championship in

a position that fell short of what our remarkable
history deserves. We are conscious that we need

to do more and better and will be intensifying our
efforts and the investments necessary to achieve our
sole objective: to win the Championship.

The GT Racing Season ended on a very positive
note once again with a tally of 25 international
titles crowned by our 36" victory in the 24 Hours
of Le Mans. Ferrari’s track car range is now more
competitive than ever, thanks to the new 488 GT3
EVO 2020 and 488 Challenge EVO, unveiled during
the Finali Mondiali at Mugello.

We are also increasing our commitment to
sustainability in every area of the Company. Aside
from hybrid and first steps in electric technology, our
work has been focusing on energy consumption in
our facilities. In fact, we are pleased to say that this
year there was a decrease in energy consumption

comprehensive carbon footprint to enable us to
set ambitious targets to become ultimately carbon
neutral over the longer term. In the course of the
year, we also further invested in one of our most
important assets, our people, by making 12% more
training hours available.

The extraordinary results we achieved this year are

a tribute to all those who make up the Ferrari Group.
We would like to thank all of them for their outstanding
personal and professional contribution, and for the very
clear passion and sense of responsibility displayed in
their work each and every day.

We also take this opportunity to thank you, our
shareholders, for remaining our trusted partners
and supporters in this crucial period of growth and
innovation for Ferrari.

We cannot close this letter without referring to the
Covid-19 that, at the time of writing, affects us all
worldwide and particularly in Italy. Our priority

is and will always be to safeguard the health and
wellbeing of all Ferrari employees while assuring to
the extent possible our responsibilities towards our
business partners, clients and all other stakeholders.
