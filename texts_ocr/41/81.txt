FERRARI N.V.

/ Training and talent development

—

To shape and prepare the managerial class of the
future for the business, innovation, management
and human capital development challenges.

In 2019, 40 Ferrari talents, from all across the
organization, started the second edition of the
Ferrari Corporate Executive MBA, organized in
partnership with the Bologna Business School. The
objective of the masters program is to improve the
management skills of the attendees, to let them gain
experience on the most recent innovation trends and
to convey the Ferrari leadership model. This master’s
degree offers a unique, tailor-made program to form
a critical mass within the management class that
will be able to grasp the challenges of the future,
while at the same time preserving the tradition of
Ferrari. During the course of the studies, innovation
talks, leadership scrums and site visits to production
plants are carried out. This master’s degree will

help to develop a group of managers with a shared
approach to leadership, while respecting and valuing
individual differences. A group on which Ferrari can
rely on to tackle future challenges.

To foster and support the inclusion, growth and
development of our people.

In line with business and Company requirements
and coherently with the needs expressed in the
Performance & Leadership Management system,
training activities were provided in the managerial,
technical and linguistic fields, using various training
tools such as: online courses, classroom courses,
coaching programs and teambuilding activities.

The innovation of 2019 was gaining access

to the Harvard Manage Mentor e-learning
platform. The training offer, provided through
this platform, has been customized according

to our needs and the following three lines of
development: to integrate this platform with

the Performance and Leadership Management
system, to give employees, especially newcomers,
the basic managerial skills that we consider
essential requirements and to adapt professional
development paths based on employees’

career levels.

In addition, an online training campaign is launched
every 3 months and includes all the corporate
mandatory trainings dedicated to new employees.
These kind of campaigns are repeated periodically
to provide a training update to all employees.
Among the mandatory courses, a session is
dedicated to our Code of Conduct that covers also
anti-corruption and human rights topics. In 2019,
a similar mandatory online campaign was launched
on GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
training.

In 2019 we consolidated the activities started the
previous year: we introduced the new employees to
the “Ferrari way” to ensure know-how continuity
and continued to build employee skills in order

to meet the challenges of the future: 15 new cars
between 2019-2022, 5 of which were presented
during 2019, including the SF90 Stradale, our first
hybrid series-production car.
