FERRARI N.V.

 

Chent relations

Our clients are the backbone of our business
together with our brand and our technology.
We do not promote our brand or our cars
through general advertising. Our main brand
marketing and promotional activities have two
principal targets.

Firstly, we target the general public. Our most
significant effort in this respect is centered on our
racing activities and the resonance of Scuderia
Ferrari (see “—Formula 1 Activities”). We also
engage in other brand-promotional activities,
including participation in motor shows and other
public events.

Secondly, we target existing and prospective clients,
seeking to promote clients’ knowledge of our
products, and their enjoyment of our cars both

on road and on track, and to foster long-term
relationships with our clients, which is key to our
success. In 2019, more than 70 percent of our new
cars were sold to Ferrari owners.

By purchasing our cars, clients become part of a
select community sharing a primary association
with the Ferrari image and we foster this sense
of fellowship with a number of initiatives. We
strive to maximize the experience of our clients
throughout their period of interaction with
Ferrari - from first contact, through purchasing
decision process, to waiting-time management
and ownership.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we launched
the MyFerrari App, an app created to enhance our
clients’ connection to the Ferrari world through
the direct distribution of tailored content. This
new channel enables clients to directly access
features and services, expanding their relationship
with both the brand and their preferred official
Ferrari dealer.

Client events

We organize a number of client events in Maranello
as well as other locations.

Our factory in Maranello is the core of our client
engagement strategy and a symbolic hub attracting
clients and prospects worldwide. Upon invitation,
clients and prospects can visit the factory, witness
some of its workings and experience several Ferrari
core values such as heritage, exclusivity and
customization. At the factory, clients also have

the opportunity to configure their cars through

our personalization and bespoke program (see “—
Ferrari Line-Up Strategic Pillars-Personalization Offer” ).

Every new model launch is carefully staged

and selected clients and prospects have
preferential access to the new car. The new model
Presentation begins with the release of images
providing a preliminary view of its design.

Clients are then invited to a preview or world
premiere. A public model presentation generally
follows at motor shows where clients are provided
access to the Ferrari stand. Further country and
regional events follow before delivery of the first
cars to dealers.

In May 2019, clients from all over the world were
invited to the world premiere of our first series
production Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)
- the SF90 Stradale - with a presentation and gala
dinner hosted at the Fiorano race circuit.

In September 2019, Ferrari launched “Universo
Ferrari” exhibition, the first ever immersive
exhibition dedicated to the world of Ferrari,
set in a dedicated location overlooking the
Fiorano Circuit. This new event format hosted
the premieres of two new Spider models - the
812 GTS and F8 Spider, and had over 14,000
