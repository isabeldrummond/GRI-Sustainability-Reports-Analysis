Intellectual Property

We own a number of registered designs and utility
patents. We expect the number to grow as we
continue to pursue technological innovations and
to develop our design and brand activities.

We file patent applications in Europe, and around
the world (including in the United States) to
protect technology and improvements considered
important to our business. No single patent is
material to our business as a whole.

We also own a number of registered trademarks,
designs and patents, including approximately 493
trademarks (word or figurative), registered in several
countries and across a number classes. In particular,
we ensure that the maximum level of protection

is given to the following iconic trademarks, for
which we own approximately 4,000 applications/
registrations in approximately 140 countries, in

most of the main classes for goods and services.

The names of our sports, GT, special series and
Icona car models and Formula 1 single-seater
models are also registered as trademarks (and
logotypes) and we also register their domain names
and the carsâ€™ design.

The protection of intellectual property is also
increasingly important in connection with our

design and brand activities. Therefore, we adopt

and follow internal processes and procedures to
ensure both that all necessary protection is given

to our intellectual property rights and that no

third party rights are infringed by us. In addition,

we are particularly active in seeking to limit any
counterfeiting activities regarding our Ferrari branded
products around the world. To reach this goal we
closely monitor trademark applications and domain
names worldwide, actively interact with national and
local authorities and customs and avail ourselves of a
network of experienced outside counsels.
