TIM Sustainability Report 2019
HUMAN RIGHTS

° [GRI 418] associated with the privacy of the Group’s employees, customers and suppliers, and the protection of their
personal data;

° associated with freedom of expression, in particular online, supported by access to telecommunications technologies;
° potentially violated by added value services (for example, services with content reserved for adults and gambling);

° of children and young people to be protected from (cyber)bullying or harassment;

° associated with environmental protection (in particular electromagnetic fields);

° of the communities in which TIM carries out business, with particular attention to vulnerable groups of people (e.g.
disabled people, minors, the elderly, women).

The Policy sets out the unfiltered and anonymous reporting mechanisms in line with the requirements of the company
procedures (specifically, that relating to “whistleblowing”), available on the Group’s website.

The efficiency and monitoring of the Human Rights Policy, approved by the Chairman of TIM, is ensured by the Human
Resources, Organization & Real Estate Department, responsible for its observance as regards the involvement of TIM’s
people; the Procurement Department, responsible for seeing it is complied with by suppliers; the Compliance Department,
which monitors the risk of non-compliance with the reference legislation; and the Sustainability Reporting, Monitoring and
Relationship Department, responsible for updating the Policy.

(In)Formation and training on human rights

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] Following the publication
of the Policy, in 2015 a classroom training course was organized and attended by representatives of the various company
departments. The course was held by an external company expert in sustainability tissues and was attended by the
General Manager of Amnesty International Italy.

Moreover, an online course was created for everyone in the company, available from the end of 2015. The course, updated
in autumn 2018, is available on the TIM Academy e-learning platform for Group employees and - from July 2019 - for all
stakeholders (in Italian only) at the URL? https://dirittiumani.gruppotim.it?.

Both the workshop and the online course highlighted, among other things:

* what Human Rights are and the main international Institutions that govern them;

* businesses and Human Rights, focusing on any impact their business activities may have on Human Rights;

° the importance of businesses that operate in the telecommunications industry in the defence of Human Rights;

° TIM and Human Rights: what can be done - in the case of doubt - by individuals of the Group for the protection of
Human Rights;

° how and when to use the reporting mechanism.

In 2018 in Brazil TIM Partecipagdes made a version of the course respecting the local context available to all its employees
on the “Conexdo TIM” platform. Among its aims were to broaden knowledge of the subject among employees, in
particular to highlight how Human Rights feature in day to day work.

TIM also continued to promote diversity through its internal communication channels; during the TIM Talks week,
promoted by the Human Resources department for employee development, diversity was one of the topics discussed.
