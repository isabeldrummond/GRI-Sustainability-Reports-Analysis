TIM pays particular attention to the issues of inclusivity and valuing diversity,
for their positive impact on the ability to generate innovation and improve
performance, increasing people's productivity and the quality of their working
ife. TIM has been engaged in inclusivity since 2009 and was one of the first
Italian companies to set up an Equity & Inclusion Management program. TIM
is the first Italian company and first telco provider in the world in the Thomson
Reuters Diversity & Inclusion Index, reaching sixth place worldwide in 2018
and 2019.

TIM also works on social digital inclusion, especially in terms of economic
benefits and specific measures for certain categories of customers, such as
deaf, blind or visually impaired customers, customers with low income who
are in a situation of "economic hardship" and "social card" holders.

n addition, TIM guarantees to support customers residing in areas affected
by natural disasters (seismic events, floods), both in the phase of emergency
management and in the medium/long term, to protect their needs.

TIM Participagdes supports an economically sustainable telecommunications
policy that enables us to provide society with digital inclusion in a competitive
environment. We achieve this with policy documents addressed to national
policymakers and contributions to public consultations promoted by
government authorities.

The Educacdo Conectada innovation policy in Brazil is integrated with other
public policies and the goals of the country's National Education Plan (NEP).
TIM acts through the TIM Institute, encouraging and providing education to
state school students in science and mathematics that reflects the current
state of knowledge in these fields.
