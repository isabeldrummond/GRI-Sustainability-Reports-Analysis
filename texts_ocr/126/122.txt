TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

My TIM App: structured planning of actions, both in order to promote the app to new customers and to launch a new
in-app communication channel involving already existing users ("Fique por Dentro" - similar to Instagram stories);
My TIM Website: conclusion of the migration of the main functions to a new version that allows reactive behavior
(process started with prepaid customers in 2017);

Captive Meu Plano (Capture My Plan): relaunch of the web channel platform focused on the prepaid segment,
restructuring with usability improvements and launch of new functions;

Naked portal: improvements in its use as a digital channel for the self-provisioning (self-supply) of customers.

[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] TIM Participagées also relates to its customers via twitter, facebook and
instagram (the latter was launched in March 2019 and had gained more than 245,000 followers and over 27,000
comments at the end of December 2019). In December 2019, "@TIMBrasil" (http://twitter.com/TIMBrasil) counted over
755,000 followers and its facebook page (www.facebook.com/timbrasil) over 2.8 million likers.

In 2012, TIM Participagdes also activated a further channel “@TIM_AJUDA” (https://twitter.com/TIM_AJUDA), which
allows to communicate with customers via Twitter. In December 2019, this account had more than 276,000 followers and
over 248,000 tweets.

[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] TIM Participagdes carries out three types of nationwide customer
satisfaction surveys, by means of interviews:

the survey relating to both own consumer customers and competitors' consumer customers - conducted "hot" every
month since June 2017 (online panel), with data consolidation every quarter - which measures the general satisfaction
of customers with the Company and its contact points (e.g. sales structures, call centers, digital channels, coverage
and quality of the technical network and, with regard to internet connections, tariff plans and offers, billing);

the Call Center Satisfaction Survey, carried out once a month “cold” through telephone interviews, involving Company
mobile customers who have contacted the call center in the last fifteen days. Since June 18, 2018, the sample size of
this survey and of the target audience has been reduced, limiting it to the post-paid segment and to call centers
dedicated to companies. Since January 19, 2019, the survey has focused only on call centers dedicated to companies;
The Transactional Survey Call Center is now the main channel for call center surveys as it covers all customer contact
activities (front end). This is a transactional survey because TIM's mobile customers (who use the services provided
through prepaid, post-paid and "control?" channels, as well as companies) evaluate the call center immediately after
"contact", via IVR (Interactive Voice Response).

3The Company decided to suspend this survey in December 2018 and maintain the transactional survey (consumer mobile customer call

centers) it was closer to reality, as it was carried out immediately after telephone contact with the customer (the suspended survey, on the
other hand, could take place up to fifteen days after contact).
