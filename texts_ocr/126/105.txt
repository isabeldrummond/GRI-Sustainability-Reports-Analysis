TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

The renewal of the Collective Bargaining Agreement 2019/2020 dealt only with the economic clauses of the 2018/2020
Agreement, which in addition to dealing with salary floors, salary readjustment, also readjust benefits such as Food
Allowance, Day Care Assistance etc.

Adjustments were made above the inflation rate of the country forecast for the period. This rate is used in Brazil as a
reference for the adjustment of wages and economic clauses (was 3.28% between August 2018 and September 2019
period).

Another relevant action has been the readjustment applied to store employees, far exceeding the expectation (the
inflationary readjustment index) as this readjustment was 8%. This strategy led to increased competitiveness in the hiring
market for the store segment.

The Collective Bargaining Agreement was approved at assemblies in all 26 states of the country, with a 98% approval
rating of 2,000 voting employees.

TIM Brasil maintained its model of proximity in the constant relationship with unions throughout the year, which
facilitates the moment of renewal of the agreement and a relationship of building solutions aimed at its employees.
4.5% of employees are members of unions. Collective bargaining agreements covered 100% of employees.

Health and safety

GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 403] The 2019 materiality analysis confirmed the protection of health and safety
as a material topic for the entire Group.

GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 403] Within the Italy, the regulatory provisions for occupational health and
safety, in addition to defining the necessary criteria for risk identification and assessment, provide that adequate
participation and consultation of workers through the Workers’ Safety Representatives has been implemented.

The Health and Safety at Work Management System implemented by TIM ensures that the Company complies in full
with national legislation and agreements reached with trade unions; it also establishes numerous initiatives aimed at
ensuring comparison tables are put in place to maintain high safety standards.

TIM’s Safety Management System Model involves the full involvement of all players that participate in the safety process:
company management, operational coordination figures, appointed doctors, workers and Workers’ Safety
Representatives (WSR).

 

GRI 403-1] In relation to the latter, the legislation requires that they are or appointed by the workers within the framework
of the Company Trade Unions. In this sense, the percentage of covered employees is 100%. [GRI 403-4] The number and
method of designation or election of workers’ safety representatives, together with the salaried working hours and the
tools used to fulfil their duties are agreed during the collective bargaining process.

[GRI 403-4] the corporate relationship model in terms of safety, which has always been based on participation logic,
includes about 80 Workers' Representatives for Safety throughout the country, who support five Committees made up
of a mix of company/trade union members with specific workers’ health and safety functions. These Committees present
at national and local level, according to the agreements stipulated with the trade union organizations, play a participatory
and collaborative role aimed at guaranteeing joint analyses and discussion by the company party and the union party of
all matters relating to health and safety at work, on a national and local level.

In this context, the “Health, Safety & Environment” (HSE) department supports Company organization in the
management of health, safety and environmental issues by assessing risks and identifying the most appropriate
prevention and protection measures and in line with technological development.
