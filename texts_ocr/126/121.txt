Customer satisfaction

[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] The 2019 materiality analysis highlighted the Group’s
relationship with its customers as a material topic.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] The nature of the telecommunications market is increasingly marked
by great competitiveness and digitalization which, together with simplification and compliance with customer
expectations in terms of content and services, are key elements of the competitive arena.

All this drives companies to change their business models and customer experience has become the lever used to
compete and the main activity of players who lead in the market with strategic positioning. An excellent customer
experience is the guiding factor for increasing loyalty and the perceived value of the brand, and in attracting new
customers.

In this area, TIM has begun a transformation process focused on improving customer experience and strengthening the
relationship with the brand. The “TIM around the Customer” project includes various initiatives based on transparency,
simplicity and respect for the customer. In this field, improvement plans have been launched with targeted actions and
various initiatives that, with the aim of transforming the culture, involve all employees in innovative ways: “make the
difference”, “idea sharing” and a story about customer experience (where employees are the actors).

To drive this transformation TIM has developed an extensive listening system, which picks up on customer experience in
the different “moments of truth” of the customer journey’, for example: web browsing, purchasing a service, calling
customer care, reporting a malfunction, posting on social media.

 

 

[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] Of the surveys conducted, the monitoring of the Customer Satisfaction
Index (CSI), based on the ACSI standard (American Customer Satisfaction Index), is particularly significant. The aim is to
collect information on the quality perceived by TIM customers and customers of the main competitors. Monitoring the
CSI has earned certification of conformity with the UNI 11098:2003 standard and has been included in the managerial
(management by objectives) and collective incentive system.

The 2019 results of the CSI are improving compared to the high levels recorded in 2018 (71.40, +0.3% compared to 2018)”.
In particular, on fixed broadband consumer (broadband), the increase in the CSI compared to 2018 was 3.1%, thanks to
improvement actions with a positive impact on the customer experience. With regards to the mobile market, TIM remains
the leader among the "traditional" operators. The ties customers demonstrated with respect to the Group are also seen
in the high propensity to loyalty, in an increasingly competitive context where the consumer’s experience is enriched
through comparison with different markets.

TIM’s ever-greater focus on “continuous improvement” of processes and the customer experience can also be seen
through the Net Promoter Score (NPS) of customers who speak with the telephone assistance service, which have been
confirmed to be extremely positive (NPS above 10)?.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] In Brazil, in 2019 TIM Participagdes confirmed the significant
investments in the development of the digital environment, to improve both the quality of services offered to its
customers and customer experience in general. It further enhanced the “My TIM App” channel which, in December 2019,
had 9.9 million unique users per quarter and 51 million accesses per month.

The My TIM App evolution process has continued, focused on improving performance and enriching the service portfolio,

as shown by the following initiatives:

* SQUAD: agile work began in August 2019 for the development and monitoring of new features and improvements in
digital channels;

1The customer journey is the set of experiences that a customer has when interacting with a company for a specific need, from the first contact
with the company, through a specific channel, until, going through one or more touch points provided by the company itself or by other
consumers, the expected result is achieved or not.

? For mobile+fixed broadband consumer customers, the CSlwas 71.80 in 2017 and 71.20 in 2018.

3 The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is an indicator based on international standards and used in various industrial sectors. The NPS is based on the
potential recommendation of the operator in relation to the experience accrued. On a scale of 0 to 10, “promoters” are customers expressing
votes of 9 or 10, “detractors” are those providing a score of 0 to 6, whereas the rest of the customers are considered as “passive” and are not
countered towards calculating the NPS. The NPS is calculated as the difference between the percentages of the "promoters" and
"detractors".
