TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE GROUP

Particular attention is paid to organizations that deal with issues relating to:
° — the development of fixed and mobile ultrabroadband networks;
° — digitalization of public utility services;
° — use of public funds;

° — the spread of digital culture.

With full respect for the principles of transparency and accountability, TIM responds flexibly to requests, regardless of
how they are received from local institutions.

Joint projects between TIM and local authorities are managed in a way that defines the roles and duties of each party,
formal control mechanisms and measurement tools. TIM promotes the formation of joint control committees, i.e.
committees formed of representatives of all the parties involved.

The composition and objectives of the committees are determined according to the specific requirements of the project
and provide for the presence of stakeholders without any kind of discrimination, including gender discrimination.
Monitoring and constant interaction with the decision-making centers of local institutions take place by means of
meetings, hearings, the presentation of position documents and involvement in workshops as well as in the work of
regional commissions and specialist working groups. TIM frequently organizes communication initiatives on specific issues
of local interest.
