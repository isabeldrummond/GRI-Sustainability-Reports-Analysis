consolidation of social and environmental aspects of the supply chain as a material topic for the Group.

Digital represents the new collective progress factor which, in different ways, offers new opportunities that greatly impact
the economy and society.
Suppliers have a direct influence on the communities and areas within which they carry out their activities, to which must
be added the involvement of organizations that oversee the environmental and social aspects related to these activities.

GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] The procurement process adopted by the TIM Group is based on
the competitive comparison of the technical and economic characteristics of the offers presented by the selected
suppliers, based on corporate procedures that comply with business ethics.

Products and services are acquired at the best market conditions and must meet particular requirements of functionality,
quality, safety and respect for the environment, in complete compliance with current laws and legislation.

 

 

GRI 102-9] The purchasing departments focus on specific sectors, so as to provide accurate responses to the
requirements of internal customers and stakeholders.

Brazil, and are mainly aimed at the following categories of products and services:

11% compared with 2017), of which 3,682 for the Domestic BU1 (-2% compared with 2018 and -7% compared with the
2017 total), 871 for Brazil (-12% compared with 2018 and -21% compared with 2017)”.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] The selection of the TIM Group’s suppliers involves a pre-
contractual qualification stage, in which the economic/financial and technical/organizational characteristics are assessed.
If the result of this assessment -which also includes consideration of the business ethics and respect for Human Rights,
workers’ rights and the environment -is positive, the suppliers are registered on the Group Supplier Database.

[GRI 412-3] In all the contracts signed, there is a specific clause which makes it mandatory for the supplier to accept the
principles expressed in the Group’s Code of Ethics and Conduct?.

[GRI 412-3] As regards the domestic operations, the Italian suppliers on the database with considerable value (the
threshold is 3,000 euros cumulative per year) receive’ initial screening in relation to respect for the principles of the Code
of Ethics and Conduct and are subject to regular assessment. The actions taken by TIM to check suppliers varies

BU.

3 The Group Code of Ethics and Conduct (CE) reads: “Compliance with the Code must also be guaranteed by external collaborators and, where
envisaged in the company procedural system, by third parties that do business with the Group”. In particular, the internal procedures require
suppliers to accept the principles laid down by the CE, and contracts for temporary consortia or corporate investments to contain clauses for
safeguarding the Organizational Model 231 (which is based on the CE). The UN Global Compact is, on the matter of Human Rights, the point of
reference of the Group’s CE, which reads: “TIM has signed up to the United Nations’ Global Compact on Human Rights, work standards,
environmental protection and the fight against corruption, and ensures that this institutional commitment is fully implemented by undertaking
regular initiatives on environmental and social issues”. The CE also contains specific clauses on the prohibition of discrimination, intimidation,
corruption and the protection of health and safety. Moreover, the Group policy on respect for Human Rights specifies that “Fundamental Human
Rights (e.g. working hours, fair remuneration, minimum age for starting work, workplace conditions, accessibility to the disabled, protection of
maternity, prohibition of harassment, prohibition of forced/compulsory/restricted labour)” and “rights regarding health and safety (we consider
the high standards of health and safety as a milestone of our success and our aim is to minimize injuries and occupational illnesses)” must be
guaranteed for both the people of the Group and the human resources of suppliers.
