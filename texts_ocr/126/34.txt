Notes in the table:

a: by Authority is meant independent authorities, for example of supervision and control such as the Italian Communication Authority
or the Italian data protection authority, or, in Brazil, ANATEL (National Telecommunications Agency) and MCTIC (Ministry of Science,
Technology, Innovation and Communication).

b: the “Companies of the TIM Group” have been considered as stakeholders and, more specifically, as "Customers" (e.g. TMS - Telecom
San Marino) and "Suppliers" (e.g. Olivetti) both to facilitate the mapping process of the stakeholders who have a relation with TIM and
to highlight possible feedback issued to determine materiality.

In the same year, for the functions in charge, TIM organized a training workshop on stakeholder engagement, on its
importance for the definition of materiality issues and on the new methodology adopted in the company that makes use
of a collaborative platform equipped with applications for sustainability and semantic analysis techniques and big data.
Then, in order to identify the most relevant stakeholders for the company, the designated employees were asked
(following the criteria of the AA1O00SES standard) to insert on the platform the map of the relevant stakeholders, the list
of events and the relevant relationships managed with the most important stakeholders; the issues raised during these
events. On the same platform, in 2020 TIM intends to implement further stakeholder engagement and collaboration
initiatives useful both to feed in "real time" the process of updating the materiality analysis with the results of the
comparison carried out on it, and to make the involvement of stakeholders more continuous and solid, keeping the
relationship channels open, and to co-design to create shared value.

 

[GRI 102-42] [GRI 102-43] The stakeholder engagement process takes place on a regular basis both during the course of
the company's operations and in the implementation of specific projects.

On the basis of Company goals, business-related and not, relevant stakeholders are identified for every project, priority is
assigned to them, and the most suitable strategies for building relations are studied, which can include individual
meetings, group meetings, information sessions, shared projects, surveys, focus groups, etc.
