[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 418] Research and innovation in e-security

TIM is involved both in research and in innovation regarding cyber security and more generally the security of information
and networks. Activities carried out in 2019 included the following:

he development and application of machine learning! algorithms and artificial intelligence for the evaluation and
prediction of the risk level of potentially dangerous e-mail messages and the automatic classification of malware
samples;
implementation of the responsible disclosure program? to collect and manage vulnerability reports on TIM services,
products or equipment spontaneously provided by customers, researchers or security experts. The persons filing
reports are confident that the vulnerabilities are managed within a guaranteed timeframe and undertake to keep
what they discover confidential until the countermeasures can be applied;

he creation of a forensic analysis laboratory to support the investigation and analysis activities carried out in case of
hacking;
ongoing work on the development of a proprietary threat intelligence platform? to support the collection, analysis and
consumption of intelligence on new security threats; The relevant issues addressed during the year included: the
development of criteria for estimating the level of confidence, reliability and relevance of the information acquired,
he upgrading of breach indicators, and the integration of multiple sources;

participation in the work of the four-year project CONCORDIA‘ (Cyber security COmpeteNCe fOr Research anD
nnovAtion®), as part of the European research programme Horizon 2020, and in particular the initiative "Establishing
and operating a pilot for a Cybersecurity Competence Network to develop and implement a common Cybersecurity
Research & Innovation Roadmap*" with a focus on Intelligence platforms, tools and processes;

overseeing and steering the activities of the 7GSMA (GSM Association) Fraud and Security Group, as Deputy Chair;

he collaboration, within the scope and 3GPP® SA? SECAM?®, for the definition of the security requirements and test
methods on devices for 3GPP standard (SECAM) networks and those for the security of 5G infrastructure;
