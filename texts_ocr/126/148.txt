TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

[GRI 308-1] [GRI 407-1!] [GRI 408-1] [GRI 409-1] [GRI 414-2] All suppliers of the Domestic BU have been assessed to
consider the social/environmental risk; in 2019, there were 42 at higher risk (no change from 2018 and down 18% from
2017). 17 purchase and suppliers? operating in the following geographical areas are considered to be at greatest social
risk: Asia, Central and South America, North Africa and Eastern Europe.

[GRI 410-1] For the employees of organizations which supply security guard services in Italy, the Consolidated Law on
Public Security must be complied with, in particular Art. 138, subsection 2, which specifies the professional and training
requirements of sworn guards. In Brazil, law 7102/83 establishes the rules relating to private security. Among other things,
it ensures that all those intending to be hired as security guards for a security business must have attended a training
course, delivered by schools accredited by the Federal Police. After hiring, once every two years the guards must take an
update course.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] Since 2014, all suppliers interested in a qualification process (new,
extension, renewal), relating to areas of procurement that present the greatest risk in terms of sustainability answer a
specific self-assessment questionnaire to determine the socio-environmental sustainability risk. Periodically updated
based on the results and evolution of the qualification process, the questionnaire was developed according to the main
requirements of the relevant responsible corporate management standards relating to respect for ethical values and to
safeguarding the environment (including SA 8000, UN Global Compact and ISO 14001) and to the best industry practices.
[GRI 308-1] [GRI 414-1] The self-assessment sustainability questionnaire is integrated into the application that handles
the supplier qualification process, which automatically extended it to all new suppliers operating in markets where
sustainability is considered to be at risk. Refresher campaigns were mounted for suppliers previously qualified in TIM’s
Register of suppliers. The results of the questionnaire will make it possible to refine the risk matrix described above.

[GRI 308-1] The application of the green procurement policy, which contains guidelines for establishing the environmental
requirements of products/services purchased, continues to be an integral part of the procurement process. The policy
covers all stages of the product life: design, production, use and end of life. Published on the “vendors hub” supplier portal
of TIM and in the sustainability section of the telecomitalia.com website, the document helps to orient purchasing policies
towards low environmental impact products and services.

 

 

 

[GRI 414-1] [GRI 414-2] In 2019 in Brazil a self-assessment questionnaire on sustainability issues was sent to suppliers
whose orders exceeded one million reais, equal to 71% of the total number of suppliers. All 831 suppliers involved
responded by the end of 2019. The results are used as an indication for future selection processes.

Sustainability checks

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] Activities intended to verify the sustainability performance level
of common suppliers and sub-suppliers continued in 2019 in the framework of the Joint Audit Cooperation? (JAC) initiative,
in accordance with the memorandum of understanding signed at the end of 2009 by TIM, Orange and Deutsche Telekom.
Proximus, KPN, Swisscom, Vodafone Group subsequently joined the initiative in 2011; Telenor and Telia Company in 2012;
Verizon in 2013; AT&T, Telefonica and Rogers in 2016; MTS, Telstra and Veon in 2018 and Elisa OYJ in 2019.

The purposes of the Joint Audit Cooperation are:

1 [GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 407] The Group policy aimed at preventing the risk of violation of trade union rights is that relating to
“Relations with Suppliers in the TIM procurement process”, which reads: “...the Group demands of its suppliers and promotes, through them,
and including with regards to sub-suppliers, respect for the following principles and provisions of law in force in the countries where these
stakeholders operate... all employees have the legal right to constitute and/or belong to trade union organizations aimed at safeguarding the
individual and collective interest. The role of the workers’ trade union representatives must be acknowledged, and they must not be subject to
any form of discrimination; in order to go about their union activities, they must be guaranteed remunerated permits and the means necessary
to communicate with the workers on the workplace”. The same concepts are also stressed in the Group’s policy on respect for Human Rights.
