loT and environmental research

As a further demonstration of its commitment to the environment, every year TIM invests in research into innovative
solutions for limiting environmental impact by limiting the consumption of natural resources and energy. These activities
are detailed in the following paragraphs.

TIM has also had many patents granted in this area. TIM has begun numerous ICT research projects in the area of the
Internet of Things (loT), applied to the world of Smart Cities and of positive environmental impact.

Smart grid. loT application for the management of electrical networks in terms of distributed generation and remote
control. Continuing sharing telecommunication and power distribution network infrastructure with a view to cutting costs
and reducing their environmental impact.

Smart water. loT application for managing water distribution networks through the identification of hidden water leaks.
To search for leaks and optimize distribution costs, TIM is also experimenting with multi-utility smart metering solutions
(applications for real time usage monitoring), which cover water, gas and, if necessary, also electricity, based on
widespread networks like loT Narrowband’.

Smart waste. Efficient management of the waste cycle for increasing sorted collection and reducing illegal dumping. The
fill levels of the various recycling centers are measured in real time and vehicles sent out to empty them only when
necessary. Result: time and expense are minimized and roadside bins overflowing with municipal rubbish are avoided.
Other projects. In the field of eco-sustainability, the REPLICATE (Firenze Smart City) and MONICA (Torino Smart City)
projects are particularly significant.

The REPLICATE? project focuses on smart energy, smart mobility and smart waste solutions and the development of loT
platforms for managing the distribution of water and waste management in collaboration and partnership with the
municipality of Florence. It was launched in 2016 and will last for five years.

The MONICA? project is focused on urban noise pollution and safety in public life. TIM contributed to the “Torino Smart
City” project known as SMILE* focusing on the theme of life & health. Based on input from the SMILE project, the
Municipality of Turin has drawn up a master plan for Torino Smart City. TIM has signed a Memorandum of Understanding
with the Municipality which provides for the use of 5G technologies to develop sustainable smart city services. The project,
which began in July 2017, will be completed by mid-2020.

Consumer Products: TIM eco-friendly
In order to improve the environmental efficiency of products offered to customers, attention has to be paid to their energy
aspects to optimist consumption while meeting the needs of the services delivered and applying “design for environment”

‘This solution is based on a new radio interface which can be used either on a portion of the LTE signal band (or on the band separating the
bands), or independently in portions of the spectrum made available by the release of frequencies.
