[GRI 102-19] [GRI 102-20] The system by which the CEO delegates powers to the departments that report to him, and
they in turn to their staff, is the subject of a specific company procedure that establishes the methods by which this
system must be implemented (Granting and Revocation of Powers) and the regular checks on it. Sustainability matters
are delegated to the head of the Administration & Financial Statements and Sustainability Reporting Department to
which the Sustainability Reporting, Monitoring and Relationship department reports. The first organizational reports may
in turn delegate certain powers to their collaborators; [GRI 102-21] in particular, powers are granted in this way to manage
relations with stakeholders (customers, suppliers, public administration, employees, etc. described in the Stakeholder
Engagement section of this document).

[GRI 102-25] The company procedure for carrying out related-party transactions drawn up in compliance with Consob

On October 16, 2017 and November 2, 2017, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers issued measures taken on the basis
of the investigation regarding the exercise of the powers deriving from the so-called "golden power". In 2019 the
Legislator, in addition, used a specific prime ministerial decree on 5 September to impose the exercise of special powers
with regard to the supply of 5G technology produced outside Europe. Further details can be found in the Group’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

[GRI 102-29] [GRI 102-30] [GRI 102-11] The internal control and risk management system consists of a set of rules,
procedures and organizational structures intended to ensure the healthy and proper management of the company, in a
way that is consistent with the established goals, through an appropriate key risk identification, measurement,
management and monitoring process. Being responsible for the internal control and risk management system the Board
of Directors defines the system guidelines, verifying their adequacy, effectiveness and proper operation, so as to ensure
that the main risks facing the company (including operational, compliance, economic and financial risks) are correctly
identified and managed over time.

The establishment and maintenance of the internal control system are entrusted to the Executive Director and to the
Executive responsible for preparing the company’s accounting documents in his/her area of responsibility, so as to ensure
the overall adequacy of the system and its effectiveness, from a risk-based perspective, which is also considered when
determining the agenda of Board meetings. The coordination of subjects involved in the internal control and risk
management system is outlined in the Report on Corporate Governance. The internal control system is contained in the
so-called “Organizational Model 231”, i.e. an organizational and management model adopted pursuant to Legislative
Decree 231/2001, aimed at preventing offenses that may result in liability for the company.

1 “Related parties” of TIM refers to physical or legal entities related to TIM pursuant to the Consob regulations. The Procedure also applies to the
