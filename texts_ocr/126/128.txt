Child protection

[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 102-2b] The 2019 materiality analysis highlighted - for the TIM Group - the online
protection of children (cyberbullying, child pornography, gambling), as a material topic.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-2b] Group Companies have undertaken numerous initiatives to protect
children from content that may harm their psychological and physical development (for example, content that is violent,
racist, offensive to religious sentiment, etc.).

Adult services come under value added services, also called premium or content-based services, and can be supplied by
TIM or external companies that own the content via SMS, MMS or mobile internet services (WAP - wireless application
protocol), which can be activated, received and/or used on mobile phones, tablets and PCs. From its activation, the TIM
card is already enabled to use value added services with adult content, with the exception of TIM cards registered to
minors, whose adult-content services are disabled.

The Group - in accordance with current regulations - provides the customer with a series of tools to protect minors from

accessing the sensitive content provided; TIM constantly updates and communicates these tools to the customer,

through its own information channels (including the 119 customer service and the website tim.it). The tools to protect
minors currently available to customers are:

* permanent restriction (black listing) of mobile users from accessing adult content;

* adult content provided on the TIM mobile portal (“TIM WAP”) can only be accessed by entering a code (adult content
PIN) on the user’s mobile device, which is different from all other codes used on the device itself in order to prevent
minors from accessing said content. The customer is provided with the adult content PIN confidentially, and is
responsible for its proper use and safeguarding;

* customers can ask for their mobile number to be black listed only for sensitive content other than adult content at
any time via TIM’s usual information channels.

Further information regarding the activation and deactivation of the above protection tools is available at tim.it, from
Customer Services on 119 and from authorized TIM retail outlets.

The TIM-Protect solution is the exclusive TIM option for total protection against web threats:
* parental control: protects young people while surfing the Net, filters web searches, gives warnings in the case of
behavior that is judged to be dangerous, allows you to block access to sites or apps or limit their use (maximum usage

time setting);

1Gambling.
