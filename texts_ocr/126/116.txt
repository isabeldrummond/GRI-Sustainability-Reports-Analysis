1 Please note that in the table, the year of return of employee x has not been calculated according to the year in which x effectively returned, but according to the year in which x took leave. Therefore, ifx took leave in 2018 and returned in
2019, his returnis in any case reported in the 2018 column. This is why the data for the 2019 column is still partial and not yet able to be published.

2 Please note that in the table, the year of continued work of employee x has not been calculated according to the year in which x was at work after 12 months of leave, but according to the year in which x took leave. Therefore, if x took
leave in 2017 and after 12 months was stil at work in 2019, his continuation at work isin any case reported in the 2018 column. As we do not yet know which of the employees who went on leave in 2019 will still be at work after 12 months,

‘we are unable to calculate the figure for 2018.
