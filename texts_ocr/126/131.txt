Product responsibility

[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417] [GRI 419] The 2019 materiality analysis confirmed customer

relations quality as a material topic which, for the TIM Group, also incorporates responsibility for the products and services

offered.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417] [GRI 419] TIM is primarily an operator of telecommunications

services, which do not endanger the physical health of users’, and it does not produce the telecommunications equipment

it sells.

In order to verify that the products placed on the market comply with health and safety legislation, the Company has:

* appropriate internal structures that check the incoming quality of the products it markets (fixed and cordless
telephones’, access gateways’, etc.), both in Italy and in the production centers of manufacturers overseas;

* laboratories that test the products marketed by the Group, particularly as regards the electromagnetic emissions of
the mobile devices’.

In this way, any non-conformities of products are detected prior to their market release, ensuring that products that do
not conform with the essential requirements of the European Directives do not reach the end customer.

Services provided to customers are subject to the requirements set out in the Service Charters and in the Terms &
Conditions of Subscription, available at telecomitalia.com.

[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417] [GRI 419] This paragraph describes the management approach
assessments for each of the above mentioned Standards, with the relative methods used and results.

[GRI 416-1] In its laboratories, TIM validates the satisfaction of the essential requirements envisaged by the current
Directives for the release of CE marking; conformity with these requirements is certified at source by the manufacturer.
For products sold in Italy, the reference framework is the set of standards that support RED Directive 2014/53/EU, EMC
Directive52014/30/EU, and Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU, divided by product macro-family®.

In relation to electrical safety in the use of equipment by customers, as required by the Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU,
TIM carries out checks on the technical provisions introduced to reduce the risk of electrocution, overheating, fire and
mechanical hazards, by applying standards EN 60950-1, EN 60065 and EN62368-1.

Furthermore, TIM checks:

* energy efficiency aspects, required by Directive 2009/125/EC ErP (Energy-related Products), as equipment placed on

the market, are checked against the stand-by/off-mode power consumption and performance limits set by European

Regulations 1275/2008/EC, 801/2013/EC and 278/2009/EC, for equipment and their external power supplies (available

as accessories);

* device functionality under various environmental conditions of terminal installation and use including potential

accessory components for connection to the fixed network is checked. Checks are carried out in compliance with

temperature and humidity ranges established by ETS! (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) standards

for the specific “service condition”, on which different “severity” levels are based. The checks are carried out based on

the provisions of the ETSI EN 300019 standards, with the tests set out under IEC-EN series 60068-2-1 (cold), 2 (dry
heat), 14 (temperature changes), 30 (moisture changes), 78 (continuous humidity);

* electromagnetic compatibility, regulated by Directive 2014/30/EU, since unintentional electromagnetic signal
emissions are checked - to avoid interference that can harm radio communication - and to fulfil certain
electromagnetic interference immunity requirements. In TIM, constant checks are carried out on terminals and

® For “Corded terminals” (connected with a cord), the following standards may be applied: EN 55022 and EN 55024, EN 55032, EN 55035, EN 60950
and EN62368-1; for “Cordless terminals” (wireless), standards EN 301489-1, EN 301406, EN 50371, EN 60950-1, EN 62311 and ITU-T P360; for
“mobile terminals (smartphones, data cards etc.)”, standards EN 300328, EN 300440, EN 301489, EN 301511, EN301893, EN 301908, EN 302291,
EN 60950-1 and EN 62209.
