TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

The identification and assessment of risks found at the Company, which is the priority activity of the preventive actions,
is ensured through constant oversight of company processes and their evolution in close connection with the
management lines. These activities are performed by specialized internal staff capable of conducting instrumental
analyses and surveys on safety in the workplace (high and low frequency electromagnetic fields, noise, vibrations, natural
radioactivity, lighting, micro-climate, manual handling of loads, etc.).

The control measures applied to eliminate or contain the risks include:

* numerous health and safety training programs, differentiated according to the risks and professional profiles found
at the Company;

e the latest generation protection and/or collective equipment and devices often designed ad hoc in collaboration with
the most important multi-nationals on the market;

* any organizational arrangements necessary, implemented in collaboration with the lines, which can guarantee an
acceptable level of risk, where it cannot be eliminated.

The most significant performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of the actions adopted include the outcomes
of the accidents analysis, which generates improvement plans defined on the basis of the causes that led to the events
and that can lead to the updating of the Company’s risk assessment.

[GRI 403-3] Work activities are classified at low and medium risk levels, in line with the ATECO classification criteria of the
National Institute of Statistics; there are no high-risk classified activities in TIM S.p.A. or the other Group subsidiaries.

Specialist activities also continued during 2019 for updating the risk identification and assessment process in line with
changes in organisation and procedure linked to the management of prevention aspects.

Monitoring campaigns with instrumental surveys focused in particular on physical agents such as: Indoor and outdoor
noise, noise from electromagnetic fields, indoor pollution. Following the assessment of work-related stress risk carried
out in 2018 (in line with the three-yearly frequency provided for in the INAIL Guidelines), the design of the related
improvement actions was started. In relation to training, work continued with technical operational personnel,
increasingly focused on the application of new technologies and new operational scenarios. With reference to accidents,
careful analysis of events and where necessary potential identification of corrective actions continued and in addition
direct involvement of the lines affected and of the HR department was reinforced for greater synergy.

As part of our experimentation with digital applications as new technologies for Safety issues, in collaboration with the
technical lines, the Q-Pole App and the X-Pole tool used for assessing of piling conditions before doing work at heights
and the Confined Environments App were released and made fully operational, so that technical personnel (both public
and company workers) can do the preliminary tests required by regulations on access to underground structures in
confined environments. The App B-Safe for managing first aid during solo work is still in its test phase.

In November the SicurinTIM project was launched, designed to promote health and safety in the workplace within the
Company. Through initiatives and events promoted over 12 months, it aims to strengthen a culture of prevention that
encourages the adoption of virtuous behavior inside and outside the Company. The project is directly supported by the
Head of Human Resources & Organisation, as well as by the Safety Steering Committee, set up in April and made up of
top management personnel who, in just a few months, have already made important common commitments, including
reducing the number of accidents.
