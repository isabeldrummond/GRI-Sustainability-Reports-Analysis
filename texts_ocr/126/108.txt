TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

2019, occupational diseases reported by workers related to musculoskeletal, respiratory, auditory and
mental/psychosomatic illnesses.

[GRI 403-4] In Brazil the collective agreements state as a rule that information must be provided on the prevention of
accidents in the workplace and occupational diseases, and TIM complies with this practice.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 403] As regards Health & Safety issues in 2019, the Company made
improvements in occupational health examination practices, with more perceived attention given to employees. The
company also developed self-care campaigns such as Pink October and Blue November, to increase awareness of breast
and prostate cancer prevention. In terms of medical insurance, the Company has worked to digitize activities resulting in
faster reimbursements to employees.
The Company carries out the Environmental Risk Prevention Programme (PPRA) every year in line with legal
requirements; a study conducted at TIM’s Brazil offices through on-site safety inspections, identifying the risks and control
measures. The aim of the Medical Occupational Health Control Programme (PCMSO) is to indicate occupational health
checks relating to any environmental risk conditions as a prerequisite for monitoring workers’ health. Moreover, an
Internal Accident Prevention Week (SIPAT) is held each year to raise awareness among employees on Health & Safety
related aspects.
The internal committee for the prevention of accidents at work (CIPA) is made up of company representatives and
workers based in all the regional offices of TIM, in line with the legal requirements of Order 3214/78 - Regulatory Standard
5. With the support of CIPA, the company sets up influenza vaccination campaigns and blood donation programs and
promotes the adoption of healthy habits amongst employees.
In addition, periodic audits and/or inspections are performed to assess the effectiveness of the prevention measures in
processes and workplaces set up to continuously improve health and safety conditions. The Health & Safety team is
made up of 32 members, strategically distributed in the regional offices of TIM Participagées.

 

People Caring

The welfare model combines tradition and future with specific strategic and organizational awareness, which places
welfare at the heart of the Human Resources strategy, enabling the use of services and initiatives aimed at encouraging
company, family and social sustainability.

Strongly focused on developing work ability (a person’s capacity to perform their work as best they can now and in the

future, with respect to the demands of their job, regardless of their age) and engagement to support digital

transformation at TIM, the model provides for the classification of activities for 3 specific action areas:

e Work-life balance: the set of services and initiatives to improve work/life balance;

e Working time management: projects to enable people to gain a more digital, flexible and simple vision of work;

e Inclusion Management: activities to place everyone in a position to give the best of their potential, identifying
personalised solutions and recovering blocked energies and unexpressed areas of productivity.

Inclusion is therefore a key area of TIM’s welfare system, but also the most challenging one, and it is no coincidence that
it is also considered a profoundly identity-based and strategic lever. In fact, it clearly permeates all founding documents
of the new organizational identity: from the Ethics Code to the Human Rights Policy and values.

TIM's welfare system therefore revolves around the wellbeing of the person in his or her "employee journey" and takes

into account the family care he or she needs time for between working and non-working life, in the awareness that
organizational wellbeing is closely related to people's satisfaction and engagement and therefore performance.
