Management

 

The issue of the impact of electromagnetic emissions, given their significant
and growing importance in the light of the recent start-up of the 5G
networks, is managed by the TIM Group within the scope of risks related to
compliance with current health and safety regulations and to engineering
and implementation of the enabling infrastructures for innovative solutions
and preparing and setting up ultra-broadband and 5G_ network
infrastructures.

The TIM Group oversees every aspect of electromagnetic emissions by:

- designing and optimizing the radio access network, ensuring that serious
attention is given to the issue of electromagnetic emissions at every stage
of the equipment life cycle;

- carefully managing the plants throughout their entire life cycle with
systematic monitoring of electromagnetic emissions levels and in
compliance with current legislation and internal efficiency and safety
standards for the population and workers;

- use of, and constant research into, the latest technological instruments
for checks and controls;

- continuously keeping an eye on legislation by proactively monitoring
possible developments and always acting in compliance with legislation.

 

Electromagnetic emissions from radio base stations (RBS) shall be assessed
and monitored using methods established by ANATEL resolutions and kept
within established limits. In 2018, electromagnetic emission levels were
measured at 23.6% of sites.

Given its national coverage, TIM Participagdes has RBSs within 147 protected
areas, often on hills or in conservation units, which are periodically
monitored to ensure that the company's operations do not negatively
impact upon biodiversity. At the end of 2018, TIM had over 800 active
biosites within the network. Biosites are structures that significantly reduce
and landscape impact. In addition to telecommunications
transmission equipment, biosites also cover street lighting and security
cameras.
