Management

 

TIM, recognizing the importance of identifying and evaluating all the impacts,
positive and negative, even potential, that its activities and the products and
services made available to its customers may have on the environment,
implements a process of continuous improvement through initiatives and
projects aimed at minimizing the environmental footprint of the company's
activities, customers and stakeholders in general.

In terms of energy, TIM is constantly committed to improving its performance
energy efficiency, adopting purchasing policies that take account of
environmental issues and proposing innovative technological solutions to
individuals, companies and government for lowering environmental impact.
In this context TIM has equipped itself with an Energy Management System
developed, implemented and controlled with reference to the ISO 50001
Standard. Every year the company sets itself the objective of reducing
emissions and energy consumption, despite the continuous development of
new-generation networks, while at the same time increasing the use of
energy from renewable sources in company processes. Finally, TIM's strategy
for the environment in the energy sector involves management lines that
optimist use of energy sources and natural resources.

TIM Participagdes has invested in renewable energy sources through
distributed generation projects, including five hydroelectric plants in the state
of Minas Gerais, and purchasing electricity on the free market.

The energy efficiency initiatives implemented in 2018 include: the temporary
or permanent stop of inactive equipment; freecooling, a heat exchange
system to reduce use of energy and refrigerant gases in air conditioning
equipment; the stop or removal of equipment from a site to save energy and
free space for new projects.

Water consumption is also managed for greater efficiency; for example in Rio
de Janeiro (RJ), in the district of Sado Cristovado, where TIM is developing a
water reuse project.

In addition, the environmental policy of TIM establishes principles to reduce
the quantity of waste produced to a minimum and boost the separation,
recover and recycling of the waste itself.
