TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

* to verify the sustainability of the most important suppliers/sub-suppliers that are common to the members of the
JAC, with production plants located in geographical areas with a significant degree of socio-environmental risk. The
checks are made through audits carried out by Third parties using a specific method developed by the JAC members
themselves, who share the results of the verifications;

* to contribute to the increased sustainability of suppliers/sub-suppliers involved by devising and implementing
corrective actions and ongoing improvement programs, establishing long-lasting and mutually beneficial cooperation
with them in terms of efficiency, productivity and risk reduction in the supply chain;

* to perform capacity building activities (capacity development), through specific supplier training programs, particularly
in order to disseminate a culture of sustainability throughout the supply chain (sub-suppliers and sub-sub-suppliers);

* share tools to address common and relevant international issues, such as climate change or circular economy.

[GRI 308-2] [GRI 407-1] [GRI 408-1] [GRI 409-1] [GRI 414-2] Between 2010 and -2019, thanks to the gradual increase in the
number of members of JAC, 639 audits! were carried out - 124 in 2019 alone - in the production plants (suppliers and sub-
suppliers) located in Asia, Central and South America, North Africa and Europe. The checks were carried out through
international specialized companies selected by competitive tender and related to a total of more than 1,326,000 workers.
The suppliers included in the audit campaigns belonged to the user devices and appliances, network appliances and IT
equipment production sectors.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] The table below shows the non-conformities recorded during

(Data relating to suppliers also operating for the Brazil BU is given in brackets)

[GRI 308-2] [GRI 414-2] For all the non-conformities encountered, specific corrective action plans were drawn up that
established resolution procedures and timetables amongst others. The implementation of these plans is monitored on a
constant basis by the JAC members?.

Moreover, in the 2017-2019 three-year period, 82% of the non-compliances detected were remedied within one year from
the start of the corrective action plan, for a total of over 600 actions.

1348 of whom were TIM suppliers (40 in 2019 alone). The total number of audits may be affected by the presence of some audits conducted
over two years.

“This item includes, inter alia, conflict minerals, |SO 27000 standards, privacy, responsible advertising, anti-competitive practices, intellectual
property, corrupt practices.

3 [GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] As the aim of the initiative is to help suppliers in the countries which are at greater risk -
in terms of the application and respect for sustainability principles - improve their performance, non-conformities always result in corrective
actions and not in the termination of the purchase contract.
