TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE GROUP

The Community

With its networks, products and technological solutions, TIM is one of the main protagonists of the evolution towards a
digital economy and, given its size, reach, infrastructure and technological assets, is fully integrated with the area of
operation and the social, economic and production context.

TIM is aware of this strategic role and therefore works constantly to manage and innovate its infrastructure and
technologies, which it places at the service of the country and to which end it makes significant investments.

The Group companies intend to contribute to the economic well-being and growth of communities in which they
operate by delivering increasingly digitalized services. Consistently with this objective and with its responsibilities
towards the various stakeholders, including the competitors listed in the sustainability section of
www.telecomitalia.com, the Group considers research and innovation to be essential conditions for growth and success.

As private entities requiring cost-effective management, Group companies take the social impact of telecommunications
services into account in their decision-making activities, responding to the needs of society, including its weakest
members.

Security and management of emergencies
With the aim of ensuring maximum cooperation, in terms of security and management of emergencies and crises,
national and local institutions and affected communities, TIM has signed and implemented the following conventions:

° A “memorandum of understanding between the Department of Civil Protection of the Presidency of the Council of
Ministers and the providers of electronic communication services to allow emergency information to be sent across
national geographical areas.”

An “agreement between the Crisis Unit at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and providers
of electronic communication services for the supply of messaging services for Italian citizens abroad in emergencies.”

° — The “Convention for implementing a device to generate Missing Child Alert” launched with the Italian Ministry of the
Interior, Department of Public Security;

° A “contract for the supply of information on the location of SIM cards used in TIM phones” with the national mountain
and cave rescue corps to locate people lost in the mountains.

In 2019, TIM was called by the Civil Protection Department and MiSE to collaborate in the design, testing and
implementation of the IT-Alert system, a new technological platform at the service of alerting, with a cell broadcast
message, all people living in an area affected by a specific natural risk.

Furthermore, as required by the relevant laws on training, we:

* test the soundness of the emergency planning and the ability of the company’s operational Crisis Management
Systems to respond;
maintain staff, structures and tools of the emergency management system in a state of readiness;

Identify, where necessary, actions to improve internal company processes and the processes used to interface with
the relevant stakeholders (institutions, communities and customers).

TIM participated in the following exercises in 2019:
° "Ankon 2019", on NBCR risks, organized by the Ministry of the Interior together with the Prefecture of Ancona;

° "Exe Flegrei 2019", organized by the Civil Protection Department, to update planning for volcanic risks in the
Phlegraean Fields.
