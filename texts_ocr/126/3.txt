TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE GROUP

FTSE4Good and Euronext Vigeo Eiris. As further proof of TIM Group's good work, for the second year in a row it was on
the Refinitiv index, a recognition that shows our commitment on inclusion.

Almost twenty years after signing the UN Global Compact, we still believe that to grow responsibly it is essential to align
our strategies with universal principles such as protecting Human Rights, work enhancement, protecting the environment

and fighting corruption.

The role that we have always played in economic and social development - and want to continue to play - cannot ignore
the difficulties that Italy is facing at the moment. This health crisis involves us all and affects us personally. The current

state of emergency imposes significant changes and radically modifies our normal life style.

It is still too early to accurately assess the economic and social impact of what is happening, but there is no doubt that
there will be consequences. The only thing we can assure is that we will always be there. We will continue to act rapidly
and proactively, through our infrastructure, our engineers and our services, to stand beside citizens and the entire Country

against the Coronavirus.
