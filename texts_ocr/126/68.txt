* In determining the impact of home-work commuting, reference is made to statistical data produced on the company’s personnel.

** Emissions due to air travel were calculated by the study and research center of American Express (the Travel Agency used by TIM) supported
by DEFRA (Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of the United Kingdom) based on the number of journeys actually made,
subdivided by the duration of each individual journey (short, medium or long).

[GRI 305-4] TIM also measures the “Carbon Intensity” of its Domestic! BU by using an indicator that establishes a

relationship between the company’s direct and
indirect operational CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and
Scope 2), measured in kg and generated by
Company's activities), with the service offered to the
customers (Tbits transmitted).

The factors taken into consideration are the amount
of data and voice traffic of the fixed/mobile network
and direct emissions produced by using fossil fuels
for heating, vehicles and self-production of
electrical energy together with indirect emissions
due to purchase and consumption of electrical
energy from grid.

In 2019 the value of the indicator fell by more than 17% compared to 2018 and by more than 33% compared to 2017”.

The traffic transmitted increased by more than 9% compared

?The comparison was made with 2017 data updated from that reported in the last Sustainability Report, following a further revision after its
publication. The updated 2017 figure for the carbon intensity indicator is equal to 10.6 kg of CO2/Tbit.
