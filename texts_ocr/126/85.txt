that this holds. The project will be rolled out against a backdrop that sees Italy still lagging behind in the European rankings
for the use of digital services, despite the high level of infrastructure the country boasts; indeed, around 18 million citizens,
30% of whom are over six years old, have not used the internet in the last year, and one in four families is without an
internet connection. Of these households, 58% state that they are not connected to the internet because they do not
know how to use it, while 21% do not use it because they do not consider it to be of interest to them [source: Istat, citizens,
businesses and ICT, 2019].

In autumn 2019, TIM launched the tour that mainly visits (and indeed, will continue to visit) municipalities with a
population of between 10 and 60 thousand inhabitants, where the company's digital training courses are to be held. In
each of these municipalities, the TIM mobile school is available to citizens (from 9.30 am to 7.00 pm from Monday to
Friday, in the town square specified by the local authorities), constituting a digital culture desk and a team of TIM digital
facilitators who offer ten short training sessions designed to help these people to discover the internet and its potential
(with particular regard to services, entertainment and security). In the three weeks that follow, inhabitants of these
municipalities will be able to take part in the classroom-based program (which consists of three two-hour modules,
morning and afternoon from Monday to Friday), in order to become "citizens of the internet"!. The courses will mainly
involve those people (most of whom are aged 50 and older) who have the greatest need to learn how to navigate online,
communicate and make use of digital citizenship services; these include using "certified email" (PEC), changing their
family doctor (GP) through the public digital identity system (Spid) or paying for a certificate through the pagoPA system.?
During the second phase, citizens can take advantage of the services offered by local digital facilitators trained by TIM,
who will transfer skills to the community and ensure the scalability of the program, by means of a multiplier effect.

TIM has launched a dedicated toll-free number (800 860 860, calls from within Italy) where those interested can learn
more about the project, follow the phases, find out about the municipalities involved and register for the classroom
courses set to take place in the various locations. More information is available on the dedicated website,

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203] AGCom decisions?

TIM's commitments in Italy, in terms of discounts and specific measures, essentially concerned the following categories

of customers:

* deaf, blind and partially sighted people. In compliance with the resolution of the Authority for Communications
Guarantees (AGCom) No. 46/2017/CONS, TIM has given both internet and landline concession offers to these
customers*. These concessions never expire and once activated do not require any request for renewal, and are also
reserved for the nuclear family in which the deaf, blind or partially sighted person lives (for further information
regarding concessions, it is possible to contact TIM customer service 187 and 119). Assistance can also be provided for
the deaf by contacting TIM customer service 187 and 119 with the Pedius app, available for Apple and Android, which
uses voice recognition and speech synthesis technologies, transforming the voice of the operator into written text for
the customer;

* people on low incomes who find themselves in a situation of “economic and social hardship”. TIM reserves such
concessions - established by AGCom® or by the Company on its own initiative® - for customers with an ISEE’ family
