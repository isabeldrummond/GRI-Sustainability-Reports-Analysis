THE GROUP

TIM Tec

One of the Brazilian government’s priorities is to increase the availability of professional and technological education
courses. In 2011, the government launched PRONATEC! on which 6 million people are currently enrolled. One of the
initiatives of PRONATEC is the e-TecBrasil Network, which provides free technical and training courses and long-distance
qualifications.

TIM Tec is a distance learning platform that uses the MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) concept”. These courses,
which are provided and made available for free on the platform, are intended for pupils at high schools and students at
technical colleges. Anyone can enrol on the courses, which teach programming languages and how to create databases,
websites, games and many other things. There are also courses for primary school teachers and others intended to
improve the skills considered to be basic for the training of any professional, such as how to write well. The technology
and content of the TIM Tec platform are share with Federal Institutes of Education, Science and Technology, with the
support of the Department of Vocational and Technological Education of the Ministry of Education (SETEC/MEC). The TIM
Institute supports the Federal Institutes in the process of installing and using the platform. Currently the platform offers
30 courses, on which about 60,000 people are enrolled.

Busca Ativa Escolar - Instituto TIM and UNICEF

There are 3.8 million children and teenagers out of school in Brazil. These are young people from 4 to 17 years old who
are being deprived of rights guaranteed by the constitution and of developing skills that will be necessary in their future
adult lives. To ensure the right to learn, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) launched the initiative to cope with
school exclusion Fora da Escola Nao Pode! (Out of School Children).

In 2014, Instituto TIM joined UNICEF to develop the technological solution Busca Ativa Escolar, a free software platform
that will facilitate and encourage the work of municipalities in the active search of those 3.8 million children and
teenagers. The objective is to provide public managers with an innovative approach to reach out to children who are out
of school by means of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).

The technological solution enhances the coordination of different areas of government, as everyone have access to the
same database. The system allows each municipality to monitor their children out of school, cross information through
filters, identify the highest demands, sort them by neighborhood or age group, check the open and resolved cases. With
this type of quality information, public managers have more subsidies to monitor and make decisions on how to tackle
school exclusion in their municipality. Now, more than 3,000 Brazilian municipalities are enrolled in the platform.

Corporate Governance

[GRI 102-18] [GRI 102-19] [GRI 102-24] TIM S.p.A.’s governance system is structured in the conventional way and provides
for a management body (Board of Directors) and a control body (Board of Statutory Auditors). The Board of Directors is
appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting on the basis of lists presented to those entitled to vote that overall own at least
0.5% of the ordinary share capital?. [GRI 102-22] [GRI 102-24] The only stakeholders represented in the Board of Directors
are the shareholders. Directors’ powers are granted (and revoked) by the Board of Directors, which determines the
purpose, limits and methods by which they are exercised.

TIM’s Articles of Association require the least represented gender to account for at least one third of the total number of
directors, rounded up to the next unit in the event of a fraction.
