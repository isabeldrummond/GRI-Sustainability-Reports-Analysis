[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 401] The materiality analysis conducted by TIM in 2019 confirmed the following
material topics for the Group: managing labor relations and developing employment, health and safety of workers,
together with skills development, reducing inequality and the ability to promote equal opportunities.

Digital skills are fundamental for the growth and strategic development of the entire sector. So, there is a need to
continuously update training models to support digital transformation and the relative evolution of professional skills in
the Company. To meet the challenges of the future, TIM requires continuous learning, operational and methodological
flexibility and an innovative problem-solving approach to ensure results are quickly achieved.

In this scenario, TIM is recognized as a knowledge company with technological and market leadership thanks to the

expertise and skills possessed by its people, where differences and sharing of knowledge represent added value to achieve

the set business objectives.

At TIM, the enhancement of human capital serves to achieve the business aims through its human resources activities,

which are described in the following paragraphs and always implemented in full compliance with the reference policies!.

The conviction of the link between human capital and the achievement of business objectives led, among other initiatives

by the Company in 2019, to the completion of an engagement survey, within the Domestic BU, an example of widespread

and structured participation in which everyone's voice was heard and people's perception of their own experience of the

Company was analyses.

The survey was completed by over 30,000 employees, 64% of the Company's people.

Four areas were investigated:

e Strategy: questions related to confidence in the future, competitive market strategy, prospects and priorities for action
Added to this is the individual's perception of their activity, objectives and performance as part of a larger picture;

e Leadership: questions about the effectiveness of management (top managers and managers/coordinators) in terms
of their ability to define and implement the Strategic Plan, support people in achieving performance and development
goals, listening to individuals’ ideas, opinions and needs.

e My job: questions about the scale of engagement, both in terms of individual involvement and willingness to go
beyond expectations, and in terms of individuals' satisfaction with their own work;

e Innovation: gathering opinions on the flexibility of the workplace and its ability to translate external stimuli and
mistakes into concrete actions, with the right level of individual responsibility and with an inclusive approach.

 

Overall and on average, 50% of respondents were satisfied, 25% neutral and 25% dissatisfied with the survey. The same
percentages were recorded within the individual thematic areas.

Following the survey, a set of actions on the different areas for hearings are planned to improve overall satisfaction, which
will be monitored by the end of 2020 with a new engagement survey.
