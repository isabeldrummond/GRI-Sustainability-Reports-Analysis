TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

e Development of people and skills: implementation in the three years 2019-2021 of a total of 1,580 level changes and
400 actions to increase the working hours of the 25% of staff in part-time employment. TIM staff also received a one-
off payment and paid leave days in appreciation of their contribution to the implementation of the company's
strategy.

Performance Bonus for the three years 2020-2022

The Company and Trade Unions have reached an agreement that defines the structure of the 2020-2022 Performance
Bonus for TIM Group companies.

The agreement provides for the option to convert the bonus amounts into welfare benefits.

The agreement, concluded as part of the second level negotiation process, is based on economic indicators (40% EBITDA
and 40% Service Revenues and quality - 20% Customer Satisfaction Index-).

The targets recognize the contribution of workers to the achievement of the expected earnings and quality results.

The average value of the Bonus for TIM S.p.A. was also defined, correlated and commensurate with the achievement of
the objectives, with an average payout for the achievement of the target of 1,350 euros for 2020, 1,400 euros for 2021
and 1,450 euros for 2022.

The parties also agreed the Welfare option, whereby people can choose to take advantage of all or part of the bonus in
Welfare services, benefiting from total tax relief. The list of services includes, among others, kindergartens, school fees
and books, elderly care, health care, pension funds, mortgages, vouchers, sports and leisure, which are only part of the
welfare component in which TIM invests.

A specific joint consultancy body has been set up to manage the agreement, which will be notified of the goals each year,
derived from the budget process, in accordance with the Industrial Plan; this body is tasked, inter alia, with analyzing the
types of services accessible through welfare.

Work-life balance

e During 2019, the Company and Trade Unions signed specific agreements, intended to extend the emergency
measures to improve the working conditions of the 700 TIM employees in Genoa and province following the collapse
of the Morandi bridge". One year after the signing of the memorandum of understanding, the extraordinary temporary
measures were extended to lessen any inconvenience for employees both in their home-work commutes and in
carrying out their professional activities. TIM's intention is thus to respond fully and practically to the state of
emergency, at least until the completion of the new bridge.

e For staff in Rome and Bari - cities particularly affected by the project to rationalize the company's offices - the
possibility of extending the number of days of agile work from home has been confirmed, until the operational start
of the new company agreement, in order to facilitate work-life balance.

Industrial Relations activities in Brazil

In Brazil, in 2019, TIM held a total of 19 meetings with the union representatives committee. The committee represent
the 27 unions in the country.

In the first half of the year, the 2019 Profit Sharing Program was negotiated, which established the 4 goals and targets
for the year. The award was also redefined by the result obtained in 2018, the increase of the program's target award to
2.3 salaries and extinguished the performance management link as the program's premium accelerator.

The negotiation was an excellent solution for recomposing the premium payment in view of the expectations of all, being
very well evaluated by the unions and well received by the employees, showing TIM's recognition of the efforts made in
2018.

In the second half of 2019, the renewal of the Collective Bargaining Agreement 2019/2020 was negotiated.

1On August 14, 2018, the Genoa bridge, known as the Morandi bridge, partially collapsed, causing severe transport problems for the local
population.
