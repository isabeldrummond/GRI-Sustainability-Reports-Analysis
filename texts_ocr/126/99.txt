TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

In addition to changes to fixed remuneration, during salary reviews, other variable remuneration instruments (Lump Sum
bonus) can be put in place - normally excluding Senior Management with Strategic Responsibilities - to reward
outstanding performance or particularly good results during extraordinary initiatives not part of normal activities.

The short-term variable remuneration (MBO) on the other hand aims to establish a transparent link between pay and the
degree of fulfilment of annual targets. To this end, the targets were fixed according to quantitative indicators that
represent and are consistent with the strategic priorities and business plan, measured according to pre-established and
objective criteria.

The MBO 2019 system provides for a “gate” objective made up of the company indicator (Group EBITDA), a bonus access
condition linked to all the incentive objectives; although it is for all personnel, the objective prize for 2019 has different
minimum levels for eligibility, to take into account the different level of challenge required of management.

With regard to the remaining targets set in MBO, for direct reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, the focus is on the
economic and financial objectives attributed to the Chief Executive Officer and a strategic objective linked to the Business
Plan has been introduced; for the other managers, the most significant economic and financial objectives are considered,
to give adequate space to the specific role objectives, which are in any case objectively measurable.

Finally, it should be noted that in 2019 Performance Management was exceeded as an objective within the MBO system;
the evaluation of managerial behavior is in any case ensured as part of the corresponding monitoring process, parallel to
and independent of the MBO system.
For those who report directly to Executive Directors, the bonus target values are set in continuity with 2018 and are up to
50% of the fixed component. For the remaining incentivised staff, the target values are set - based on the role complexity
- at up to 30% of the fixed component.
With regard to the pay-out of the incentive system, it should be noted that in 2019 an innovative element was introduced
in the form of a corrective factor to reduce the pay-out, aimed at strengthening the culture of sensitivity among
Management to the Company's internal control and risk management issues: the multiplier is in fact related to the failure
to implement corrective actions/remediation plans defined in the Control Functions.
The accrued bonus is fully liquidated in cash form, at the time that the results achieved are confirmed?. For 2019, the
possibility has been introduced on an experimental basis for executives to choose between paying the accrued premium
on a pay-as-you-go basis and paying the entire amount - or part of it - to their supplementary pension fund.
Long-term variable remuneration is aimed at promoting consistency between the interests of management and those
of shareholders, through sharing of the business risk.
On July 24, 2018, the Board of Directors approved the 2018-2020 LTI Plan and Performance Share plan, with a three-year
vesting period?, and a two-year lock-up. This Plan is reserved to the Chief Executive Officer and owners of managerial
positions with a major impact on company results. The Plan is subject to the achievement of the performance condition
linked to the increase in both the share value and economic and financial indicators.

For both the MBO system and long-term plans, a contractual claw-back? mechanism is in force, which allows for retrieval
of the variable remuneration paid out to Executive Directors and managers with strategic responsibilities starting from
2016. As defined in the policy, the claw-back clause can be triggered in the three years following payment of the sums.

 

 

 

1To provide accurate information on the relationship between Senior Management remuneration and that of the Company population [GRI 102-
38], [GRI 102-39], in accordance with the "Policy for Information Classification and Management in terms of confidentiality", TIM provides some
information, useful for the calculation, in the usual table form, in the Remuneration Report and in the Annual Financial Report.

? Vesting period is the period that separates the time of the Plan assignment from that of the Performance Shares accrual, corresponding to the
years 2018, 2019 and 2020.

3 aa contractual clause allowing variable remuneration paid to be recovered in the event that the disbursement was a result of malicious or
grossly negligent behavior of the executives involved, or in the event of a data formulation error that led to a balance sheet restatement.
