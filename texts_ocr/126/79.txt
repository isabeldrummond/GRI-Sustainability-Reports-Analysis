TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

The RAN sharing agreement enables TIM to promote the dissemination of LTE in the Brazilian countryside, effectively
access and back haul’. At present, the 4G Sharing RAN is based on three national partners, extending the benefits and
efficiency of this technical model.

Following continual testing and the consequent enabling of energy saving functions and solutions, mainly during low
traffic periods, for the 2G, 3G and 4G access layers,the energy consumption recorded for the site, dependent on the access
technology and coverage conditions, showed a reduction of up to 10%.

impacts on the environment and company

loT - In 2018, TIM Participagdes launched the first NB-loT? commercial network in South America, in the city of Santa Rita
do Sapucai, to develop innovative services together with INATEL (Telecommunication National Institut) University, a
leading research center in Brazil. TIM also enabled NB-loT coverage in 2018, in the cities of Itajubd, in conjunction with
UNIFEI (Universita Federale di Itajuba), and Rio de Janeiro. TIM Participagdes is aware that the mass introduction of the
loT can significantly change the mobile telephone market, as it drives the creation of services and - among others - is a
potential tool for agricultural applications, vehicle connections, traceability solutions and social/health assistance.
Two important goals were achieved in 2019, and namely the activation of an E-SIM (Embedded SIM?) platform, and the
acquisition of a loT/M2M platform. These two infrastructures will enable TIM Participagdes to adopt an E2E M2M*/loT
system, allowing TIM to promote important innovations and new products, aimed at using the potential of the loT in
different vertical sectors.

Agrobusiness - Since 2018, TIM Participagdes together with Nokia and BR Digital has been focusing on the potential
agrifood business in Brazil, offering connections in rural areas (not only for company applications, but also the digital
inclusion of agrobusiness employees and residents in small towns). One of the projects delivered in April 2018 to Jalles
Machado, an energy group in the city of Goianésia, replaced manual appointments with mobile ones, improving
communication between the office and field; plus computers on board agricultural machines mean that information can
be managed in real time. The project integrates 812 smartphones and 1006 company lines, with 650 smartphones for
appointments in the field. In 2019, TIM consolidated its positioning in relation to vertical agriculture’, by creating the
ConnectarAgro agrosystem (https://conectaragro.com.br/) that brings together TIM, suppliers of solutions for the
agroindustry and suppliers of telecommunications solutions.

 

5G - In April 2018, the “Architecture & Innovation Technology” Department completed its studies and tests on interference
in the city of Guaratiba (State of Rio de Janeiro) in the 3.5 GHz band, considered to be the band at the forefront of 5G. The
aim was to demonstrate that IMT (International mobile Communication) in Brazil, in the 3.5 GHz band, and the reception
of the fixed satellite service (FCSS), in the adjacent C band (3625-4200 MHz)°®, can co-exist without any limitation on the
use of 3.5 GHz. During the first half of 2019, ANATEL planned rules for the use of 3.5 GHz and an auction for the first
quarter of 2020 concerning the 3.5 GHz e 2.3 GHz bands.

 

In June 2019, TIM Participagées selected three cities, Florianopolis, Santa Rita do Sapucai and Campina Grande to test the
5G technology. In September, TIM set up a TIM 5G Home, in particular during HackTown 2019, the innovation festival
sponsored for the first time by TIM Participacgdes, which is held each year in Santa Rita do Sapucai (in the State of Minas
Gerais). With a specific ANATEL license, the TIM 5G home demonstrates accessible solutions on an interactive basis (with

 

1In the telecommunications sector, a back haul network (return loading) or return network is the portion of a hierarchical network that includes
intermediate connections between the central network (or core or backbone), and small subnetworks at the "edges" of the hierarchical network.
? Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-loT) is a standard LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) radio technology developed by the 3GPP for
communication to a wide range of mobile devices and services.

3 This is a minuscule chip embedded in the device (in particular smartphones), which is extremely compact compared to conventional telephone
SIMs.

* Machine to Machine means the technologies and services that allow for the automatic transfer of information from one machine to another,
with limited or no human interaction.

5 These are crops above ground, in closed greenhouses, that grow to height on several, automated, climate-controlled levels, with reference to
large plants. These systems are 75% more productive than traditional field crops, and use around 95% less water. Plus, they have no geographic
constraints, as they can be used in urban areas, offering locally grown fresh produce.
