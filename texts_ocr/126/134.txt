[GRI 417-3] In Brazil the only notifications relating to advertising and marketing communications are issued by CONAR?,
a non-governmental self-regulation organisation for advertising which assesses non-conformities with the Brazilian
Advertising Code of Conduct (“CBAP”) and can recommend that the company change/correct or suspend the advertising
(it does not impose financial penalties); CONAR seeks to ensure that each advertisement is true, honest, and compliant
with the laws of the country and the principle of fair competition. The infringement proceedings may be closed if the
parties reach a settlement, if the perpetrators cease the infringement or if the violation of the Code of Ethics has not been
demonstrated.

In 2019 TIM Participag6es received eight notifications from CONAR (three promoted by competitors Claro and Nextel and
five by CONAR), to which it expressed its opposition. CONAR has ordered the closure for three cases and a marketing
modification for three other cases; in one case the parties reached agreement, while in the last case the parties reached
a partial agreement for which they are awaiting a decision.

ANATEL can impose fines or warnings in the event of non-compliant “general marketing communications”. In 2019,
ANATEL did not impose such sanctions on TIM Participagdes, while it had imposed a sanction of 280,984 reais in 2018
and one of 70,471 reais in 2017 (the latter two related to unclear Company business information).

‘Taking only significant fines into consideration, i.e. those exceeding 500,000 reais, TIM Participagdes did not receive any during 2019. TIM paid
two fines in 2019; the first of 11,484,107 reais, ordered by an agency that protects consumer rights, for non-compliance with customer service
standards (call center). The other was of 244,551 reais, imposed by another agency as a result of various customer complaints (contracts,
invoicing, etc.).

? The cases are regulated by the Institute of Advertising Self-Regulation, which operates in compliance with the code of commercial
communication and is competent in defining all disputes relating to advertising involving the associated subjects, directly or indirectly. Jury's
decisions do not involve financial penalties but, if required, a withdrawal order of the contested marketing message.
