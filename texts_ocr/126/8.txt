TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE GROUP

Targeted initiatives are in place for the attraction and retention of talent; these include direct links with universities and
the world of higher education. In addition, as part of the application of the Group's expansion contract (in force from
August 2019 until December 2020), TIM is focusing on reconciling its organizational efficiency requirements with those
related to development. The expansive nature of this measure combines increased employment (600 new hires) with
internal training: a modern, innovative tool that can support TIM on the journey towards a digital economy.

Within the realm of Corporate Governance, taking into account the recent Law no. 160 of December 27, 2019, which
changed the rules on the “pink quota”, increasing the required share of women in administration and auditing bodies of
listed companies from at least a third to at least two fifths of the total and applying this requirement for six consecutive
terms, TIM will change its Articles of Association. The new division requirement will not make it necessary to change the
current composition of the corporate bodies, as they already reflect the new shareholding (6/15 on the Board of
Directors and 2/5 on the Board of Statutory Auditors, respectively). The change to the Articles of Association also
involves applying the criteria continuously, not just for the six terms set out in the new legislation.

Confirming the ongoing Group commitment to fight any form of corruption, in 2019 the Parent, TIM S.p.A. adopted the
Anti-bribery Management System (also ‘SGA’) for which it attained UNI ISO 37001 “Anti-bribery Management Systems”
certification.

TIM has therefore also identified among its priority goals the targets in Goal 5: Gender equality (targets 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and
5.b) and Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions in relation to corporate governance and management of hunan
resources (targets 16.1, 16.3, 16.5 and 16.q).
