e the infomobility solutions allow traffic flows and travel times to be optimized and therefore lower greenhouse gas
emissions;

e systems for the monitoring and analysis of consumption allow the optimization of the energy efficiency of offices and
households.

In all cases, there are services that in addition to optimizing production processes and logistics flows in various sectors,
help customers reduce emissions generated by physical travel. TIM products and solutions are characterized by their
reduced energy consumption and their contribution to reducing energy consumption. The efficiency improvements,
savings achievable in economic terms and reduced environmental impact associated with the effective use of TIM
services are also a real business opportunity for the Company: awareness is growing among stakeholders and citizens in
general on issues related to climate change leading to companies turning their attention to ways of achieving significant
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to ensure a sustainable future for society and the planet. These objectives are
pursued through the initiatives described in the following paragraphs.

The objectives that guide TIM's work in fighting climate change, can be summarized as follows:

e actions to reduce its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and limit the emissions of other sectors and
customers in general by supporting dematerialization and the provision of services and solutions which promote new
sustainable ways of working, learning, traveling and living;

e communicating its emissions and strategies for fighting climate change in the Sustainability Report and through
responses provided to rating agencies (RobecoSAM, VigeoEiris, Oekom, FTSE4Good, etc.). TIM participates in the CDP?
survey both in Italy and Brazil. In Brazil, for the twelfth consecutive year, it was confirmed on the Sao Paulo Stock
Exchange (B3) Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) and has participated in the national EPC-Empresas pelo Clima
programme since 2010.

e disseminating a culture which supports the individual in contributing to the reduction of emissions.

The risks associated with climate change for the TLC sector have implications of a physical, economic and regulatory
nature, with repercussions for the image and reputation of Group companies.

The risk of flooding is one of the most serious physical risks for TIM and the one most likely to occur. The resulting damage
impact ranges from reduced use to the loss of business infrastructure, with a consequent zeroing of the capacity to supply
the service. In order to prevent the potential damage, TIM’s new exchanges and buildings are built at a safe distance from
ivers and bodies of water in general and, in order to ensure continuity of service, the TIM network is designed considering
appropriate levels of resilience and redundancy. TIM’s network infrastructure in areas characterized by a high level of
hydro-geological risk is monitored through the TIM Ci.Pro. (Civil Protection) system, which uses a constantly updated
database of information on local areas and infrastructure for rapid planning of necessary intervention. Company assets
subject to physical risks have insurance coverage commensurate with the property and equipment value, and the severity
the potential damage related to the service they provide.

In Brazil, 66.6% of domestic electricity comes from hydroelectric generation’. For this reason, extreme rainfall levels or
long periods without rain can compromise the water level in reservoirs and have an impact on the national energy supply.
In this event, TIM could be affected by energy rationing measures and fluctuations in the average kWh price due to
imate change effects. In addition, increased extreme weather frequency and strength could damage transmission
towers, increasing business expenses for the acquisition of new equipment and maintenance of existing equipment. This
could also lead to an increase in insurance costs and signal interruption or loss of quality to the detriment of
telecommunications services. In addition, changes in air humidity and salinity have a direct effect on goods and
equipment located underground and close to coastal areas with a consequent increase in operating costs. In the event
of an average temperature increase, electronic devices whose performance is directly related to stable temperatures
could require surplus energy to be cooled. It should be noted that climate change could also increase costs for staff
absences, as well as cause greater difficulties in reaching workplaces or locations where staff are working, having an
indirect impact on company performance.
