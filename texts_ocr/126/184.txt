processes and procedures that support the collection, aggregation, processing and
transmission of non-financial data and information to the management responsible for the
preparation of the DNF.

Furthermore, for significant information, considering the Group activities and characteristics:

- at Group level

a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the DNF, and in particular
to the business model, policies implemented and main risks, we carried out
inquiries and acquired supporting documentation to verify its consistency with the
available evidence;

b) with reference to quantitative information, we have performed both analytical
procedures and limited assurance procedures to ascertain on a sample basis the
correct aggregation of data.

- for the Italian companies belonging to the Business Unit Domestic, we have carried out
analysis on the procedures of self-assessment carried out by TIM S.p.A. with respect to
the principles of the guidelines UNI ISO 26000:2010, in accordance with the practice
UNI/PdR 18:2016 of April 29, 2016;

- for the following companies, TIM S.p.A., Olivetti S.p.A., Telecom Italia Sparkle S.p.A.
and TIM Participagdes SA, that we have selected based on their activities, relevance to
the consolidated performance indicators and location, we have carried out interviews
during which we have had discussions with management and have obtained evidence
about the appropriate application of the procedures and the calculation methods used
to determine the indicators.

Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that the DNF of the TIM Group for the year ended on December 31, 2019 has not been prepared, in
all material aspects, in accordance with the requirements of articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and the
GRI Standards.
