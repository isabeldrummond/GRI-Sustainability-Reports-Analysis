TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

CNR), the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies Pisa (SSSA), Bari Polytechnic, Bari University, Basilicata University
and Salento University. In 2019, research projects focused on 5G and the development of new use scenarios in
numerous applications developed from trials (such as Sanita 5.0 (Health 5.0), Public Safety, Smart Agriculture,
Environmental Monitoring and Smart City). One of the projects was dedicated to assessing the socio/economic
impacts related to trialing 5G;

e the partnership with the Milan State University continued, with the funding of two research PHDs, and the stipulation
of a three-year agreement, based on which a research project was started in 2019 for the development of a “family
activity recognition” module, starting from data obtained from sensors, providing service and content suggestions for
family members via a digital family assistant. The partnership is part of the initiatives of the Open Innovation
laboratory “Joint Open Lab” (JOL) of TIM Innovation, Milan;

e anagreement was established with Turin University, under which a study and research project was started on "smart
conversational systems", targeted at a better and more effective man/machine interaction;

e activities with Catania University continued, as part of the Catania “Joint Open Lab (JoL)”, with TIM Innovation
focusing on acceleration towards a market finalization of the entire loT ecosystem and 5G development activities.

[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203] Funded research activity

TIM has always been active in innovative and research initiatives funded by the European Union and by national public
administrations. This has enabled it to take part in international projects on issues that TIM should have developed, with
a high innovation content, to extend and consolidate its own know-how in sectors featuring rapid technological
developments and to work with leading research centers, academic institutions and industries of leading European
countries, as well as Taiwan and Japan; participation in projects made it possible to obtain funding of around 16 million
euros over the 2017-2019 period. In this area, it has been involved in activities carried out as part of funded projects
concerning 5G, visualization and intelligent mobility services, furthering its expertise and gaining a prominent position in
the international sphere.

[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203] Patents and Intellectual Property Rights?

In 2019, the Group's patents portfolio was comparable with that of previous years; in fact, there was a slight increase in
inventions evaluated for patenting, and a slight decrease in new patent filings. Moreover, activities to streamline the
patents portfolio resulted in some patents being abandoned, which, with technological developments, did not have any
possibility of still being used. The Group's patent areas concern the entire ICT segment, with areas of excellence in the
mobile segment, particularly concerning radio access, where TIM is one of the leading TLC operators worldwide.

In detail, the TIM patents portfolio, relative to approximately 600 patented inventions, included over 3,300 patent
applications and patents as of December 31, 2019, of which 88% comprising patents (granted by 38 patent offices).

A significant aspect of patent activities refers to the high number of patents stemming from partnerships with Universities
and research institutes: 12 % of patented inventions are the result of these partnerships.

Moreover, TIM is part of a patent pool? on Long Term Evolution, with a patented invention essential for the standard. The
patent pool acquired new participants during the year (bringing the current total to 25 license-holders) and granted
licenses to 48 companies.

[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 203] [GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203] The “Architecture &
Innovation Technology” department? is responsible for Research and Development (R&D) activities of TIM Participagdes;
its main responsibilities are defining the technological innovation of the network and information technologies,
determining the evolutionary needs for new technologies and devices, converging architectural guidelines and strategic
partnerships, so as to exploit new business models and guarantee the evolution of the network infrastructure in line with
the business strategy.

In December 2019, the Architecture & Innovation Technology function comprised 52 people including
telecommunications, electrical, electronic and IT engineers and other positions with professional profiles, skills and
