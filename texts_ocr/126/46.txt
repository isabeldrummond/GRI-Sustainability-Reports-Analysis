TIM has internal policies and procedures that integrate sustainability issues
into company processes; the Corporate Digital Communication & CSV
Projects department oversees the implementation of projects dedicated to
the generation of shared value. In addition, Sustainable Reporting, Monitoring
& Relationship oversees the relevant legislation and monitors the progress of
sustainability issues.

The digital education project for Italy "Operazione Risorgimento Digitale" by
TIM, launched during the year with the aim of boosting the country's
digitization process, promoting the adoption of new technologies by an
increasingly large pool of citizens (about 1 million) through training courses in
over 107 Italian provinces, should be highlighted. Moreover, through TIM
WCAP, TIM's open innovation hub, the company oversees the theme of Italian
digital transformation, selecting ideas, projects, products and services by
identifying startups and SMEs with innovative digital solutions with the aim
of integrating the best in TIM's offer and technology.

In Brazil, TIM adopts an innovation policy, Educagado Conectada, that is
integrated with other public policies and with the objectives of Brazil's
national education program (PNE). A key purpose of the plan is secondary
education for which, by the end of 2024, the federal government has set its
target to have 85% of the high school adolescents enrolled in secondary
school.

In 2019, the TIM Institute continued supporting projects consistent with its
mission to create and strengthen resources and strategies for the
democratization of science, technology and innovation to promote human
development in Brazil, with mobile technology as the primary activator.
