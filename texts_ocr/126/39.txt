Review

The review phase is expected to take place as a preparatory stage prior to the next reporting cycle, with the aim of
submitting the results of the analyses carried out, updated the following year, to specific consultation and involvement
activities as part of stakeholder engagement. As already reported, in 2017 the Group revised the “Guidelines for updating
the TIM materiality analysis” so that they comply with the GRI Standards and are organized in a transparent manner for
the analysis process.

Boundaries

[GRI 102-47] All the themes that are judged to be material have major implications both inside and outside the Company

without exception, and which are relevant to all external and internal stakeholders, these being. The material themes
identified are:

e correctness of corporate conduct

e stakeholder engagement

e integration of social, environmental and governance aspects into corporate strategies

e managing the health and safety of workers

e development of the company's human capital

e fair management of customer relations

Other topics mainly concern Group companies acting as operators in the ICT world, which represent the main part of the

Group in terms of turnover, employees, including in terms of the impact on external stakeholders:

e stimulate the spread of e-technologies and e-skills;

e protection of vulnerable groups (cyberbullying, child pornography, gambling)

e safeguarding privacy and personal data protection and security

and the Company on which stakeholders pin their greatest hopes.

[GRI 102-49]. Finally, there have been no significant changes in the business perimeter (and therefore of boundary
importance) in the last few years.

Risk management

[GRI 102-15] [GRI 102-29] [GRI 102-30] [GRI 102-11] The Group has adopted an Enterprise Risk Management Model
(hereinafter ERM) which allows risks to be identified, assessed and managed uniformly within Group companies,
highlighting potential synergies between the parties involved in assessing the Internal Control System. The ERM process
is designed to identify potential events that may influence the business activity, in order to manage risk within acceptable
limits and provide a reasonable guarantee that business objectives will be achieved.
