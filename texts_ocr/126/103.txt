The challenge of technological transformation - The Expansion Contract

[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 402] The acceleration in technological transformation in the
Telecommunications Sector, in which TIM operates, has created the need to address, at company level, integrated
organizational review activities, digitization of processes and adaptation of the skills and capabilities of all staff.

In this context, as part of the negotiations for the renewal of the second-level contract, the Social Parties defined a set of
agreements seeking to combine the achievement of the objectives set out in the Industrial Plan with the safeguarding of
workers' needs, including the Expansion Contract (hereinafter the Contract), introduced by Law 58/2019 to support the
technological development processes of companies with more than 1,000 employees.

The Contract (signed in August 2019 by the government) is an innovative tool that combines the needs of efficiency with
those of development, allowing companies to adapt the skills of their staff and acquire new ones from the external
market.

TIM and the trade unions have recognized the need and urgency to jointly address, within a framework of clear and
shared rules, the effects of the ongoing digital revolution, implementing all actions that can both protect jobs and help
the evolution of professional skills.

The Contract provides for the entry into the Company, during the two years 2019-2021, of 600 new permanent employees
with ICT-related profiles and different levels of professional seniority.

Another important theme contained in the Contract is related to professional retraining and consequent training for TIM
people in line with the company's objectives, enhancing existing skills, replacing obsolete ones and developing new ones.

The expected reduction in working hours is 6% or 1.9% depending on the different sectors involved. This is a vertical
reduction, that is, on full days.

Supplementary Contract 2019

In 2019, negotiations continued on the second contractual level of TIM S.p.A. These negotiations sought to identify, in

compliance with reciprocal roles and shared rules, instruments and measures to combine the principles of productive and

organizational efficiency and professional development, achieving them within an overall sustainable balance. Many in-

depth analysis and discussion sessions were held with the trade unions, in the context of which a substantial part of the

company's supplementary contract was agreed, on various topics such as:

e Work-life balance: additional days off, paid leave, Agile Work, Remote Work for Caring Agents working in large cities,
unpaid leave, leave to be made up for with overtime, flexible hours, paid leave days to make up for the holidays falling
on Sundays in 2019.
