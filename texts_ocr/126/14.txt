Economic value produced and distributed

The Group aims to achieve a balance between the three dimensions:

e environmental sustainability: maintaining the function of ecological systems, ensuring a balance between the use of
natural resources and the company’s activities;

e social sustainability: promoting the principle of fairness between generations and within the same generation;

e economic sustainability: maintaining and increasing capital.

[GRI 102-7] TIM reports on what it does to achieve this objective in the Sustainability Report, which focuses primarily on

environmental and social sustainability, as well as aspects that are both of a social and economic nature (e.g. customer

care and innovation management) and the Annual Financial Report, which discusses the Group’s economic performance

in detail. In order to give a comprehensive view of the Group’s sustainability, we have provided some summary data of

economic performance in the Appendixes, which are drawn from the Annual Report. The distribution of revenue by

product and service and the trend in the Group’s capitalization and debt is shown in the “Revenues” note of the TIM

Group’s consolidated financial statements and the Report on Operations of the TIM Group.

[GRI 201-1] The economic value produced and distributed to the stakeholders is shown below. Since 2008, the

presentation method recommended by the Global Reporting Initiative has been adopted, with appropriate adaptations.
