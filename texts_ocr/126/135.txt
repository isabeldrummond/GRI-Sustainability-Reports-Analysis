Safeguarding privacy and personal data protection
GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 418] The 2019 materiality analysis identified the safeguarding of privacy and
personal data protection as a material topic for the Group.

GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 418] Respecting privacy regulations is a priority for TIM, which since 2003 has
had a structured organizational model in place which is capable of overseeing the correct application of this legislation
at Group level. Company departments are committed to ensuring the correct processing of personal data of data
subjects, including customers and employees, in carrying out business activities.

n May 2018, the Data Protection Officer function was established at TIM Group level, dealing with control, consultation,
training and information regarding the application of privacy legislation, in compliance with the specific provisions of
Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data (so-called
"General Data Protection Regulation," or GDPR), applicable in Italy and in the other countries of the European Union from
May 25, 2018.
The GDPR is the primary source of the applicable regulatory framework on data protection in Italy and the Personal Data
Protection Code (Legislative Decree 196/2003, as extensively amended by Legislative Decree 101/2018) now contains the
national provisions completing those of the GDPR.

The adoption of legal measures and the instructions of the Italian Data Protection Authority for personal data protection
is assured by constantly updating the Group regulations and policies. Of these, the “System of rules for the application of
the regulations relating to the protection of personal data in the TIM Group” (System of Rules) is particularly important;
it defines the provisions and operating instructions to comply with these provisions.

Already in the course of 2018, the System of Rules was thoroughly revised in the light of the application of the GDPR; in
2019, the System of Rules was further updated with reference to regulatory developments, in particular in relation to
Legislative Decree 101/2018, which adapted the Privacy Code to the GDPR, and to the additional provisions of the law and
the Italian Data Protection Authority's Decisions that followed during the year.

In 2019, the work continued to adapt policies and procedures, including those setting out data breach’ obligations
(extended to all types of personal data) and those regulating the management of the requests of data subjects
concerning the exercise of their rights regarding personal data protection.

With regard to training, the online training module on GDPR, already prepared in 2018 for the start of GDPR application,
was updated and its mandatory use was extended to all TIM Group employees; this form must also be used by newly
recruited staff.
In addition, specific measures have been planned for certain company sectors. An ad hoc training course has been set up
for TIM's customer care resources (consumer and business), as well as for outsourcer staff, who have a coordinating and
supervisory role. The course focused on topics of interest such as:

i) processing of customer/prospect requests concerning the exercise of privacy rights;

ii) data breach and management. In all, 11 training sessions were held with the participation of about 400 people. An
online training module on the above topics was prepared for Customer Care employees.

TIM’s management staff tasked with managing relations with other electronic communication operators, as well as with
the activation and technical assistance activities for equipment and connections, was the target of a training course on
the topic of data breaches, which saw the participation of 37 TIM employees.

Finally, as part of training on Big Data Transformation, a module on the GDPR and Big Data, delivered in several editions
and attended by 50 employees of the TIM departments involved, was organized.

 

 

 

[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 418-1] The effective application of the internal policies is monitored through an
extensive control system based on regular self-assessment procedures, sample checks carried out by the relevant central
and regional departments, based on established procedures and methods, as well as for planned and identified second
level controls, also due to the inherent risk level of processing.

In the light of these activities, the Personal Data Processing Activity Register was revised and updated, with the support
of a special IT tool, both to further improve its compliance with GDPR provisions and with a view to its use as a corporate
compliance catalogue, to address the compliance requirements of Information Technology systems, identify possible
areas for improvement and manage the related action plans.
