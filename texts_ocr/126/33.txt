Anti-trust case 1799 Year 2017 investigation for possible breach of Article 101 of the TFUE (prohibition of agreements that
restrict competition) against TIM S.p.A. and Fastweb S.p.A. TIM, in agreement with Fastweb, submitted some
amendments to the AGCM, in the form of proposed commitments, aimed at closing the investigation without any breach
being ascertained and, therefore, without any fine. In March 2018 the AGCM resolved to approve the commitments,
making them binding on the parties, and closed the case without imposing a fine.

Fastweb, Wind Tre and the industry association Asstel to investigate the alleged existence of an agreement among the
major fixed-line and mobile telephone operators to restrict competition by coordinating their respective commercial
strategies, in breach of Article 101 of the TFUE. On January 31, 2020, TIM was notified of the closing of the investigation,
where the AGCM resolved that an agreement between Telecom, Vodafone, Fastweb and WindTre existed but excluding
from this the Asstel association. The fare imposed on TIM for participating in the anti-competitive agreement amounts
to 114,398,325 euros. TIM intends to appeal against the sanctions.

challenged aspects concern deceptive communication given to the target of reference and the aggressiveness of the
conduct. Proceedings concluded in December 2019 and confirmed unfair conduct, with a sanction of 4.8 million euros for
TIM (VO sanctioned for 6 million euros and WIND/3 for 4.3 million euros). The decision will be challenged before the TAR.

non-compliance with the PS10696 measure on advertising communications of offers in fiber. TIM stated its defense and
the investigation was concluded on August 2019 with a fine of 200,000 euros.

Anti-trust case PS11532 - "TIM in Nave". Year 2019 the investigation concerns the "TIM in Nave" services with allegations
of misleading customer information and aggressiveness. Consistent efforts to improve information so as to make
consumers fully aware of how "TIM in Nave" services operate were presented. The investigation is expected to be
concluded in May 2020 and no sanction is anticipated in the event of its validation.

Anti-trust case IP_327 - non-compliance with IBAN discrimination, Year 2019 Authority acting on its own motion, the
investigation concerns the alleged non-compliance with PV4 practices related to IBAN Discrimination in April 2019. In
particular, the AGCM disputes that the direct debit mandate process on the web channel is not yet automated and as
such the customer cannot manage this activity independently. TIM has removed all form of discrimination from direct
debit mandates with banks in Italy and in the SEPA area and introduced full automation of the mandate process on the
web. The investigation is expected to be concluded in April 2020. Similar investigations towards other major operators
have also been set in motion.
