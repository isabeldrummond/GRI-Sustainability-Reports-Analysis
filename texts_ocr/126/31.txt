TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE GROUP

[GRI 205-1b] When the corruption risk assessment process was over, TIM identified a low corruption risk related: (i) to
specific categories of transactions, projects or activities, (ii) to relationships expected or already in place with relevant
third parties or (iii) specific categories of people (relevant positions). On these transaction, project and activity categories,
Relevant Third Parties or Relevant Positions due diligence audits were carried out (Anti-corruption Due Diligence) going
in-depth into the type and extension of the corruption risks.

In Brazil, related to TIM Participagdes, the company adopts the foreign version of the 231 Organizational Model of TIM
constituting the Anti-corruption Compliance Program applying the local anti-corruption law (Ley 12.846/13). Consistent
with provisions required at group level, in September 2018, the Brazilian subsidiary adopted a new version of the Cédigo
De Etica e De Conduta e della Politica Anticorrup¢do. Moreover, during 2019, the project to adopt Standard ISO 37001 was
launched, with the assessment phase of the processes/activities relevant at company level, to identify any gaps with
respect to adoption of the standard for subsequent certification. The Standard is expected to be adopted in the second
half of 2020.

GRI 103-3] [GRI 205] The Head of the Compliance Department is appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company to
which it reports.

The variable short-term remuneration plan (MBO) assigns the Head of Department objectives in keeping with the
prevention of crimes under Legislative Decree 231/2001 and applying what is set forth by ISO 37001, in compliance with
the relative regulations.

The Group adopts the Whistleblowing Procedure that, unless specifically forbidden by local laws, encourages and allows
employees and third parties in general to report an attempted, suspected or effective corruption action, in good faith or
based on a reasonable conviction, by reporting it to the TIM Audit Department. For that purpose, a single report
transmission channel is available thus allowing reports to be managed with a maximum guarantee of confidentiality and
protects those making a report in good forth or based on a reasonable conviction, of an attempted, suspected or effective
action of corruption or a breach of the Code of Ethics and Conduct and/or the 231 Organizational Model and/or the Anti-
corruption Policy against reprisals.

GRI 205-3a] [GRI 205-3b] [GRI 205-3d] No incident of corruption has taken place in the Group companies in the past 3
years, nor have any legal proceedings been started on grounds of corruption against Group companies in the same period.
It follows that none of the Group’s companies recorded penalties or concluded plea bargains in relation to corruption in
the last three years. [GRI 205-3c] With regard to suppliers, in the past 3 years TIM has never terminated a contract for
reasons related to corruption.

 

The Group’s commitment to the topic is also demonstrated by its participation in various working groups. TIM is a member
of the “231 and Legality” Working Group organized as part of the Confindustria initiatives and during the course of 2018
contributed to the drafting of the new Confindustria Guidelines. In addition, TIM participates in the working groups set up
at B20 for the implementation of the recommendations made at G20/B20 level on anti-corruption matters.

[GRI 103-3] [GRI 205] At the end of 2018, TIM took part in a survey conducted by Transparency International amongst the
main Italian companies in the private sector to map the anti-corruption commitment. It was concluded with an index on
transparency (Business Index on Transparency-BIT).
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 205] Moreover, since 2016, TIM has participated in the Business Integrity Forum
promoted by Transparency Italia to develop activities in the private sector relating to cultural programs and the
dissemination of tools to support integrity, transparency and anti-corruption. On June 13 and 14, 2019, TIM took part in
the Business Integrity Events, an initiative by Transparency International Italy in collaboration with the Pisa Scuola
Superiore Sant’Anna focused on themes concerning integrity.

 

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 205] The Anti-corruption Management System and the Anti-corruption Policy,
the 231 Organizational Model and the Code of Ethics and Conduct are communicated to employees through specific
initiatives and are published on the intranet portal. The Code of Ethics and Conduct and the Anti-corruption Policy are
communicated to third party recipients through publication on the website, whereas third parties doing business with
Group companies are obliged to commit contractually to complying with the principles laid out in those documents.
