TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE VALUE CHAIN

TIM then presented, under real traffic conditions, the Urban Georeferenced Alert service, developed in conjunction with
the City of Turin, the FCA, the Links Foundation, the Polytechnic University of Turin, SWARCO and 5T and boasting the
ability to provide useful traffic information, such as notices of work in progress, any queues that may lie ahead and speed
reduction signs; this data is communicated to TIM's 5G Digital Business Platform, which sends it over the 5G network to
the car, allowing the driver to make the necessary decisions.

Furthermore, TIM’s 5G service at the Lingotto track in Turin has made it possible to introduce services that can share and
use information in real time to project the driver into the not-too-distant future thanks, also, to the augmented reality
sensors.
TIM launched its 5G commercial offering in Florence in the autumn, before extending it in late November to cover Genoa,
making the first services available to families and businesses.

The year 2019 ended with two major demonstrations based on TIM's 5G technology. The first of these involved a live
surgical procedure using 5G immersive reality, performed by Professor Giorgio Palazzini, who was ‘teleported’ from Rome
to the operating theatre of the hospital in Terni during the International Conference on Digestive Surgery. The operation
was followed by over 30,000 specialists and surgeons from all over the world in live multi-streaming mode. Using three
cameras installed in the hospital’s operating theatre that were broadcasting simultaneously, one of which was a special
360° high-definition camera, Professor Palazzini participated live in the operation, simultaneously observing the procedure
and the patient’s biometric data, with the ability to zoom in and out and select any details of particular interest, as well

 

as observing the patient’s internal organs in single-view mode using a laparoscopic camera that was also connected to
the network. The high quality of the 4K video communication and the immediacy of immersive reality, as guaranteed by
the low latency of 5G, meant that Professor Palazzini was able to access diagnostic information in real time, comment
on it and follow the operation as if he were part of the onsite team in Terni.

The second demonstration of TIM's 5G potential took place at the Monza circuit, which has become the first 5G circuit in
Europe. On December 6, 2019, during the Monza Rally Show 2019, live demos of the new services made possible by the
use of TIM 5G in the automotive, industry 4.0, digital tourism, smart city and drone fields were showcased, accompanied
by the announcement of the launch of 5G commercial services in Brescia.

All 5G technological development activities are accompanied by a coherent technical communications activity, ranging
tom the editorial to the promotional aspects, including scientific dissemination events and the organization of special
customer visits to the TIM innovation centers in Turin and Rome.

GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203] loT Open Lab

n November 2016, TIM opened the loT Open Lab, which became fully operational in 2017, at its base in Turin. Its purpose,
according to the methods inherent in Open Innovation, is to support the development of loT solutions based on key
echnologies for the Telco Operator. In particular, the loT Open Lab acts as a business accelerator to support companies
in entering the ecosystem of technologies standardized by the 3GPP and, as regards the current period, Narrow Band loT
echnologies. In 2018, more than 180 companies and customers visited the Lab, and among them, around fifty
construction companies agreed a partnership with TIM for use of the Lab’s facilities free of charge.

GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203] Research with universities

n 2019, Open Innovation activities (understood as R&D participatory behavior) were largely concentrated on the new
innovation model pursued at TIM and guided by top management. In particular, research and development conducted
with Italian universities focused on innovative technologies and application solutions, with a special focus on the
opportunities afforded by 5G.

As stated, the financial commitment was approximately 1.3 million euros, for specific research activities, in particular:

 

e in partnership with the Politecnico di Torino, the twenty research projects on technological innovation related to 5G
and ultra-broadband, as well as cognitive computing? and artificial intelligence, as solutions for the development of
new application scenarios in numerous contexts (for example the loT and use of drones). One of the projects
addressed ethical and privacy issues that may arise from using artificial intelligence;

e research projects defined as part of the MiSE (Ministry for Economic Development) Bari Matera 5G project continued,
involving TIM along with six academic institutions: the National Research Council (Centro Nazionale delle Ricerche -

1 Streaming can be defined as a method of transmitting or receiving data (especially video and audio material) over a computer network in the
form of a constant and continuous stream, meaning that it can be played back whilst subsequent data is being received.
? A more advanced system that gives machines a part of the functions of the human brain.
