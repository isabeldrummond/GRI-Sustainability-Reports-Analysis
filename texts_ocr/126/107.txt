* Starting from 2018 the number of injuries is presented net of dressed injuries (which involve only a dressing with work being immediately
resumed): 6 cases in 2018 and 9 cases in 2019.
** The severity, frequency and unproductivity indexes are respectively:
- the number of conventional working days lost due to accident per thousand hours worked
- the number of accidents per million hours worked
- the number of hours lost due to accidents per thousand hours worked

In TIM S.p.A., to ensure correct management of accident events, a procedure has been put in place describing the rules
and requirements of each subject in the “genesis” process, the management and closure of reports of incidents at work
and/or while traveling involving workers for which companies are required to pay an INAIL? premium.

The positive trend of a reducing number of occupational accidents is confirmed in 2019, with a recorded decrease of 10%
compared to 2018. A closer examination of the indicators shows that the decrease in the number of accidents has led to
a fall in the "frequency" index (from 6.72 to 6.42) and in the "ratio of accidents to 100 workers" indicator (from 0.98 to
0.92). However, the increase in the average duration of accidents at work compared to the year before led to a slight
increase in the values of other accident indicators such as the "seriousness" index (from 0.18 to 0.20) and
"unproductiveness" index (from 1.13 to 1.23). There were no fatal accidents at work in 2019. Details on the accidents,
occupational diseases and absences required by the GRI [GRI 403-2] standard are given in the Appendix to this chapter.
The main types of accidents identified were, in descending order: personal falls, traffic accidents, sprains/pulled muscles,
shocks, injuries resulting from materials/equipment handling, crushing, injury from falling objects and other types of
minor accidents. In relation to occupational diseases, complaints submitted to INAIL (National Institute for Insurance
against Accidents at Work) in the reference year and subject to recognition procedures were taken into account. During
