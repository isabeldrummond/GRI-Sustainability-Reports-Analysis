network equipment to determine whether they comply with the requirements of international ETSI, CENELEC?
standards regarding electromagnetic compatibility. In particular, checks are carried out on the compliance of
equipment with the limits set by standards to limit the emission of electromagnetic disturbances which, in addition
to polluting the surrounding environment, can interfere with radio communications.

To promote sustainable development in its areas of influence - in addition to the mandatory requirements for electrical
safety law, energy consumption and EMC on marketed equipment, TIM also carries out checks on electrical (in compliance
with the series K ITU-T? Recommendations) and mechanical robustness (in compliance with the installation classes
required by the European standard ETSI EN 300019) requirements, so as to reduce waste disposal of electrical and
electronic waste (WEEE) from the very beginning. Ensuring equipment placed on the market of has an adequate level of
electrical and mechanical robustness, in line with the expected stress in the field, reduces the rate of equipment failure
and, therefore, the quantity of waste to be sent to the appropriate disposal facilities. The addition of these robustness
requirements, also within TIM apparatus specifications, requires the manufacturer to use adequate protection devices on
the electrical interfaces of devices, such as overvoltage and overcurrent limiters, with the consequent reduction in the
number of destructive failures; with such technical expedients, it follows that equipment functionality can be easily
recovered by replacing a few components in repair centers.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 416] [GRI 417] By law, telecommunications equipment sold in Brazil must be
approved by the regulatory authority ANATEL, which verifies, in its laboratories, conformity with Brazilian legislation on
electrical and electromagnetic safety. There is specific ad hoc legislation to be complied with for each kind of equipment;
TIM Participagoes asks its suppliers to ensure that devices have the ANATEL certificate of approval.

[GRI 416-2] Over the past three years, no non-conformities with European customer health and safety legislation have
been found in any product that has reached the final marketing stage, neither in Italy nor in Brazil.

[GRI 417-1] When contracts are drafted, for all fixed telephony products, TIM requires packaging to include an
environmental statement, a statement about the origin of the tantalum if it has been used in the components, a user
manual containing safety information, details of any hazardous materials in the product and disposal information. With
regard to labelling of mobile devices, as they are consumer products that TIM merely resells and do not require any
customization, the Company simply requires national legislation to be complied with.

 

[GRI 417-1] In Brazil, in addition to compliance with national legislation, TIM Participagdes requires information on the
correct use of equipment; TIM Participagdes does not have the procedures on the information and labels on products and
services. However, contracts with suppliers of mobile devices include a ‘product packaging’ clause, which requires that
each box contain instructions for the correct use of both the product, the accessory kit and of the connection jacks

 

associated with the product.

For a particular product range, TIM eco-friendly, discussed in detail in the Environment chapter (TIM ecofriendly), all the
relevant environmental parameters are also shown (e.g. energy consumption).

[GRI 417-2] Over the past three years, no non-conformities regarding product information and labelling have been found
in any product that has reached the final marketing stage (100% tested for fixed and mobile terminals).

There have however been a few cases in which non-conformities with regulations concerning information and “labelling”
of services have been found. In particular, TIM Participagdes has only received financial penalties; that is, in 2019 four
incidents occurred for which ANATEL issued total penalties of 247,132 reais, in 2018 three incidents occurred for total
penalties of 397,009 reais and in 2017 13 incidents occurred for total penalties of 896,730 reais (in respect of the
guarantees and rights to protect users)

The regulatory Authority’s sanctioning procedures for non-conformities with regulations regarding information on
services are part of the system of “penalties for the violation of regulatory legislation regarding consumer protection in
