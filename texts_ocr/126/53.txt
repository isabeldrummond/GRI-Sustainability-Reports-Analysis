Environmental protection approach

[GRI 103-1, 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 302] [GRI 305] The 2018 GeSI-Deloitte report Digital with Purpose:
Delivering a SMARTer 2030 clearly shows how 103 of the 169 United Nations Sustainable Development Targets (SDGs) are
directly influenced by digital technologies. The ICT sector can contain its CO2 emissions while contributing to the reduction
of emissions from other sectors and citizens thanks to the nature of its characteristic solutions: videoconferencing, smart
working, telemedicine, social sharing platforms and all the related services that can support more sustainable behaviors
and lifestyles through digitization. It has been calculated? that the full adoption of these services would lead to a reduction
of global CO2 emissions by 1.34 Gt in 2030, offsetting the expected 189% growth in ICT emissions (2019-2030). The TIM
Group is therefore aware of its leading role in building a low carbon emissions future and is part of, and active in, industry
associations and non-profit organizations which have environmental protection among their objectives?; the importance
to TIM of environmental issues is also shown by the materiality matrix 2019, which incorporates the Sustainable
Development Goals and translates into specific areas of intervention for TIM’s strategy for the environment, as described
and disseminated through the Group's Environmental Policy’:

e definition of guidelines and management approaches for optimized use of energy sources and other natural
resources;

e gradually reducing its own direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases;

e selecting suppliers, partners, products and services based on environmental sustainability criteria as well;

e applying environmental sustainability criteria when assessing possible mergers and acquisitions;

e development of solutions and products that contribute to the fight against climate change;

e dissemination among employees and stakeholders of a correct and effective approach to environmental issues and
allocation of human, technological and economic resources for actions to protect the environment;

e recommending variable remuneration for achieving objectives with a positive environmental impact.

Consistent with this strategic approach, the Group implements concrete actions each year, which are further detailed in
the following paragraphs.

In order to increase awareness of environmental protection, a training plan was introduced for internal staff and business
partners with 9,713 total hours of training. In June, as part of the Save Energy! project TIM launched a campaign to raise
awareness about what to do to avoid wasting energy and natural resources. The targets of the campaign were 45,000
employees who spend most of the day in offices throughout the country. The initiative has been allocated a highly visible
space on the home page of the company intranet, where the Green Decalogue was published, with ten tips for the
intelligent use of energy and for saving paper and water. Simple rules conveyed in a cartoonish but effective way, urging
each employee to help to consume less, with positive effects on the environment. The driving force behind the initiative
is the conviction that saving energy is a "responsible" practice that has no limits, except in the sensitivity, ethics and
intelligence of each person, and that it can be achieved by starting from correct and widespread information on possible
consumption and behavioral choices, in the knowledge that daily activities (from the use of machinery and accessories
powered by electricity, to the consumption of water in common areas, to the cooling/heating of rooms) inevitably impact
on TIM's second expense item but above all on the environment.

To ensure the sustainable management of operational processes, the areas of TIM which have a potentially significant
environmental impact have an ISO 14001-certified Environmental Management System (EMS). In some organizations,
the Environmental Management System has been integrated with the Quality Management System based on the ISO
9001 standard, for which the respective certification has been obtained. At some particularly representative sites, a
certified Energy Management System has been developed. In continuity with previous years, TIM, through the Energy &
Utilities Management department, was also awarded the ISO 50001 certification for the sites where this system has been
implemented. The certification includes the “historic” site in Bologna, in via Stendhal, and the Data Center in Rozzano 1,
&2 and Rozzano 3, the Piacenza Centro exchange, as well as the Data Processing Centers at Padova and Bologna Roveri.
TIM therefore has a telephone exchange included in the certification scope, on top of the already certified buildings. The
