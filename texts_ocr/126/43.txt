Management

 

TIM is compliant with the obligations on workplace safety also through the
definition and periodic updating of the Risk Assessment Document. It also
guarantees the implementation of legislation on workers’ rights defining
appropriate application standards aimed at personnel management roles as
well as regulations and specific provisions aimed at all personnel.

It uses criteria and instruments to identify and manage the different Safety
operating problems, and a control system at different levels on protecting
health and safety in the workplace and the environment performed by the
Health, Safety & Environment department as part of the Company Prevention
and Protection Service.

In order to further strengthen governance on Safety issues, during the year
the company set up a specific steering committee with the responsibility of
ensuring, in line with TIM's industrial plan, the definition of the strategic
objectives of Health Safety & Environment, the vertical action plans of the
individual employer lines and the transversal actions, as well as the
monitoring of the relative progress and finally ensuring the sharing of specific
activities aimed at promoting the "Safety Culture" and good behavior in
terms of health, safety and the environment.

FAIR MANAGEMENT OF CUSTOMER RELATIONS

Risks

Risks related to the improvement of
Quality and Customer Experience

Management

 

The Company has redefined and evolved the Quality and Customer
Experience Improvement Programme ("TIM around the Customer"
reference), in a "quality-by-design" logic. The “TIM around the Customer”
project includes various initiatives based on transparency, simplicity and
respect for the customer. In this field, improvement plans have been
launched with targeted actions and various initiatives that, with the aim of
transforming the culture, involve all employees in innovative ways: “make the
difference”, “idea sharing” and a story about customer experience (where
employees are the actors). To drive this transformation TIM has developed an
extensive listening system, which picks up on customer experience in the
different “moments of truth” of the customer journey, for example: web
browsing, purchasing a service, calling customer care, reporting a
malfunction, posting on social media. Of the surveys conducted, the
monitoring of the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI), based on the ACSI
standard (American Customer Satisfaction Index), is particularly significant.
The aim is to collect information on the quality perceived by TIM customers
and the main competitors.
