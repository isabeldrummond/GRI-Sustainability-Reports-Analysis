the arrival of 5G), regarding health, education, safety, entertainment and games, i.e. the context in which we live and
work; some demonstrations have been developed in conjunction with Ericsson, Qualcomm, Cisco and Inatel, and also
with ABB, Intel and LG.

GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203] loT Open Lab

n 2017, TIM Participagdes took part in the Telecom Infra Project (TIP), an initiative set up by Facebook, SK Telecom,
Deutsche Telekom, Nokia, Intel and other companies, with the aim of creating a new approach to constructing and
implementing the telecommunications network infrastructure. TIM Participagdes has transformed TIM Lab into the first
TIP Community Lab in Latin America, for use by TIP members to create universal standards relating to solutions (initially
or transport networks, the Open Optical Packet Transport work team) in order to overcome the challenges linked to the
interoperability of the different providers. This initiative is an open, cooperative approach to developing and testing out
new technologies and solutions, such as whitebox! and disaggregated devices, for back haul architectures and data
centers.
n 2018, TIM Participagées also took part in a new work team inside TIP, together with Vodafone and Telefonica, called
DCSG (Disaggregated Cell Site Gateway’). This project is an opportunity to define a set of common requirements for
operators, and coordinate with companies that produce devices, that have greater, more flexible capacities and are
cheaper. In June 2019, supported by Facebook, TIM Participagdes organized a Proof of Concepts of the DCSG solution of
Pinfusion and Core EDGE suppliers and TIP members, in order to demonstrate the main functions of the solution.

 

 

 

Digital inclusion

[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 203] The 2019 materiality analysis confirmed geographical and social digital
inclusion in Italy and Brazil as a material topic. Amongst other things, the ICT? sector offers both potential to allow
everyone to participate in social and economic life and solutions for a better future, saving time and natural resources‘.

Geographical digital inclusion

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203] The 5G technology*

At the end of 2018, the assignment of 5G frequencies in Italy, available until 2037, was completed.

This new technology goes beyond a simple evolution of 4G performance, aiming to create an entire innovative network
and service platform capable of meeting the future demands of the 2020 digital society®.

According to the ITU-R IMT.2083 (IMT Vision) Recommendation’ of 2015, the 5G system includes a number of business
scenarios that can be grouped into three main macro-categories (each characterized by different requirements)
summarized in the following figure (scenarios for IMT use for 2020 and beyond).

The use scenarios are:
* Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), for video transmission and Gbps® communication (enabling Augmented/Virtual
Reality);

1 Software not associated with hardware.

? Based on an open, disaggregated architecture, the new DCSG is designed for the economic back haul of mobile site traffic in existing mobile
networks and in emerging 5G infrastructure.

3 Information & Communication Technology.

* According to “McKinsey Global Institute 2018/smart cities: digital solutions for a more liveable future” it also produces less waste.

5 Acronym for fifth generation mobile technology and standards.

© 5G will be introduced gradually because, in the first phase (early drop), 5G radio access will be “supported” by the LTE (Long Term Evolution)
network, which will play an integral and subordinate role.

7 International Telecommunication Union-Radiocommunication Sector, International Mobile Telecommunications.

® Giga byte per second (over one billion bytes of information per second).
