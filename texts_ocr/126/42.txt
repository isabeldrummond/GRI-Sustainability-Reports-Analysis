appropriate application standards aimed at personnel management roles as
well as regulations and specific provisions aimed at all personnel. The
Performance Management process, regularly implemented at both
management and operational staff level, defines systems for measuring
performance at all levels, professional and managerial, providing fair and
objective recognition of the individual merit of enabling the development
processes and plans.

TIM optimise's the mix of capabilities necessary to maintain a competitive
advantage in mature markets and strengthen the positioning in those
focused on digital and innovative services (e.g. loT in the context of 5G). In
order to achieve said objectives, skill assessments are structured for the
mapping of existing skills and training courses, often available on a dedicated
online e-learning platform and intended for multiple subjects according to
personal development business needs. There are also initiatives for specific
training and workshops held in person, according to the strategic need to
develop company skill sets, especially digital skill sets.

Of note in 2019, in Italy, is the signing of the expansion contract between the
company and the social partners which, among other things, envisages the
launch of a recruitment programme, seeking professional profiles compatible
with the company's re-industrialization/reorganization plan and the
implementation of a skills upgrading programme for all personnel, to support
retraining, reskilling and upskilling, including key internalisation of core,
advanced and traditional technical and specialist activities.
