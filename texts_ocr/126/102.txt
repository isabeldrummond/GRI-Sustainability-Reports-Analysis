THE VALUE CHAIN

Industrial relations

[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 402] The 2019 materiality analysis confirmed managing employment
relationships as a material topic for the whole Group. [GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 402] TIM has always
entertained open and transparent relationships with trade unions and workers’ representatives, in the belief that it is only
through continuous, constructive dialog that the best possible balance can be struck with respect to the expectations of
all stakeholders. [GRI 102-41] All Group workers, both in Italy and in Brazil, are covered by Collective Labour Agreements
reached with trade union organizations and all personnel are guaranteed the possibility of attending union meetings, in
terms of paid leave and company space to enable them to be held, as well as of freely participating in consultation
procedures for the election of trade union representatives.In no Group operations is the right to union participation at risk
or disputed. Amongst other things, union agreements lay down the ways in which these rights can be enforced and
establish the bodies in charge of controlling compliance therewith. [GRI 402-1] TIM takes care to listen to and engage with
workers' representatives, including through reorganization processes.The search for constant, constructive and dynamic
dialog has encouraged, over time, significant agreements between the social partners, aimed at balancing both business
needs and those of the people who work in the Company.

[GRI 408-1] [GRI 409-1] Collaboration with workers’ representatives, together with internal control systems and
procedures, has meant that no violation or risk has been reported with regards to the application of the Group’s Social
Responsibility policies protecting the essential rights of employment, such as the ban on forced or child labor?.

The Industrial Relations model

TIM has developed its industrial relations model over time to be geared towards ensuring constant dialog and constructive
engagement aimed at promoting the appropriate participation of trade union representatives and organizations.

The structure of TIM’s current industrial relations model, formalized with the trade unions in the Protocol of January 11,
2019, is aimed at enhancing collaboration on matters required by law and collective bargaining, in the areas of
information, consultation and negotiation, both at national and regional level.

At alocal level, there is a widespread presence of trade union representatives in all the Italian regions, which fosters active
decentralized participation allowing the specific regional needs and opportunities to be better understood and combined
by both parties. Today, 396 TIM people hold the office of trade union representative. TIM recognizes specific prerogatives
defined by company agreements in force at the time for union representatives in the company, in addition to the
protections and rights provided by law and the TLC national labor agreement.

Due to the organizational complexity and multi-regional presence, trade union representatives elected a national
representative body - in line with the Consolidated Law on Representation January 10, 2014 - called the National Trade
Union Representatives Coordinator, delegated to manage negotiations with the company for matters of a national
nature.

The industrial relations system is set up with a focus on preventive phases of information and union discussions, also
through specific corporate bodies (in the form of permanent joint commissions) with the task of the technical
development of specific subjects such as training and occupational health and safety, welfare and equal opportunities.
This system is based on a widespread knowledge of the company’s strategies, as well as a particular focus on the
protection of collective interests and the professional development of workers, enhancing the dialog that takes place
both nationally and locally.

example, training contracts for which incentives are provided by the Brazilian government.
