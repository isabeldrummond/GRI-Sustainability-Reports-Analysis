freephone number 800 500 500 available; through this, an operator can give the customer step by step assistance and
maximum support in the installation and use of the TIM Protect service.

[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-2b] In terms of tackling online child pornography and computer crime, from
an organizational perspective, TIM has established - within the Security Department and, specifically, as part of the
Security Operations Center (SOC) - the role of “Key Contact for the Postal Police”.

This person manages relations, and the flow of information, with the Postal Police? and the competent authorities, and
has the task of coordinating, within the TIM Group, the process of abuse management, in accordance with the relevant
legislative framework. Furthermore, TIM has adopted an organizational and management model pursuant to Legislative
Decree 231/2001, aimed at preventing offenses that may result in liability for the Company.

TIM has deployed resources, technologies, processes and tools to prevent and tackle “abuse”, i.e. any activity committed
in violation of the rules of conduct and the legislation that governs the use of network services, digital systems or means
of communication in general. The SOC oversees the following initiatives and activities:

to report any crimes involving child pornography encountered while browsing the internet. There is a guide to
completion, and reports can also be submitted anonymously. This activity is managed in collaboration with the
Assurance Competence Center, under Open Access/Wholesale, which receives reports and forwards them to be
managed by the SOC;

cybercrimes or the presence of child pornography on the Group’s networks, then direct them to the relevant
department, where necessary involving the relevant authorities (through the Key Contact for the Postal Police);

prerequisites of filtering tools that providers of Internet network connections must use in order to prevent access to
