TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE GROUP

TIM’s Articles of Association provide that at least half of the candidates drawn from the majority list and at least half of
those drawn from the minority lists must meet the independence requirements set by law, with the result that the
number of TIM’s independent directors is higher than that required by law. The qualification requirements for Directors’
independence are established by the CLF! and the Corporate Governance Code of Borsa Italiana, to which TIM adheres.

From January 1, 2020, with the coming into force of Law no. 160 of December 27, 2019, an increase in the "pink quotas"
present in the corporate bodies of listed companies is expected, ranging from one third (as provided for in the TIM statute)
to two fifths of those chosen. This will entail an adjustment of the statute, which will have to incorporate the new
legislative provision, but will have no effect on the composition of the TIM Board of Directors, which already respects this
proportion, as there are currently 6 female members out of a total of 15 directors.

[GRI 102-22] The Board of Directors in office as of May 4, 2018 consists of 15 members, including 12 independents. On the
company’s website (telecomitalia.com) under the heading About Us/Board of Directors/Composition each director’s role,
nationality, appointment date, list of presentation, independence status and membership of the Board of Directors are
shown; the curriculum vitae of each member is also available on the Board of Directors' website. The Directors’ skills
range from specific TLC sector experience to media and content, from mergers and acquisitions to risk management and
top management in large companies. More details are available via the telecomitalia.com website. [GR| 102-31] 13
meetings of the Board of Directors were held in 2019.

 

[GRI 102-27] The Directors take part in specific meetings with the management or external consultants, aimed at
providing adequate knowledge of the industry in which TIM operates, business dynamics and their evolution. Workshops
on new technologies and educational-informative meetings are held prior to strategic meetings. Updates regarding the
relevant legislative framework are provided in specific briefing notes. During 2019 the Councilors were also involved in
training meetings on sustainability; in December 2019 a meeting was held with Enrico Giovannini, spokesman of ASviS2.
[GRI 102-18] [GRI 102-24] The Committees are established and renewed in order to: support and monitor the
implementation of strategies and the development of plans and results; ensure the overall coordination of business
actions and the governance of related cross-cutting issues; strengthening the operational synergies needed between the
different functions involved in the different innovation, technological, business and support processes. encourage the
integrated development of the Group's innovation processes.

The committees currently set up within the Board of Directors are the Control and Risk Committee, the Nomination and
Remuneration Committee, the Related Parties Committee and the Strategy Committee. Each Committee has its own
rules of procedure which describe the composition of its members, how they are appointed and how they operate: more
details are available on the telecomitalia.com website.

[GRI 102-28] For the 2019 financial year, the self-assessment of the size, composition and operation of the Board and its
Committees was carried out with the support of the consultant Egon Zehnder. The board review is carried out every year
(since 2005). The assessment methods and results are illustrated in the Report on Corporate Governance. Sustainability
issues were not addressed in the 2019 self-assessment.
