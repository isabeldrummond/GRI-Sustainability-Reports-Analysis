TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE GROUP

[GRI 413-2] The potential negative impacts arising exclusively from excavations for installing cable ducts or positioning
radio base stations are mitigated through the use of low environmental impact technologies, such as mini trenches, and
thanks to prior agreements with local communities, e.g. regarding aerial installation sites.

How the contribution to society is measured

The contribution made to the community by the Group, calculated according to the London Benchmarking Group (LBG)!
guidelines, amounted to 17.15 million euros in 2019. 2018 and 2017 data is available on the Group website, sustainability

Fundraising

In a national and international context in which crisis and conflict scenarios are multiplying, against an ever-increasing
number of people in need and emergency situations, private fundraising is a key factor in “person-to-person” cohesion
and support.

For over 16 years, TIM has been a key player in the solidarity chain, supporting humanitarian, scientific and environmental
projects by allowing people to make a donation of one or two euros with a text message, or two and a half or ten euros
with a call to a dedicated free number from a landline. Alongside these traditional donation methods, in 2019 we
launched, before anyone else in Europe, the integrated “DonaconTIM” system, which lets us receive donations through
an app and web platform.

The new Self-Regulatory Code issued by AGCOM establishes 60 numbers, divided into 30 permanent numbers (lasting
one year) and 30 temporary numbers (lasting 20 days), with a special price list. The two emergency numbers continue to
be free. The amounts collected are returned in full, with no withholdings applied by either the tax authority or TIM for the
costs incurred.

In 2019 there were 139 charity campaigns and one emergency one, for the disastrous flooding in Venice in November,
which received more than 11 million euros. The largest amounts of money are raised for medical and scientific initiatives,
with social welfare initiatives at national level, such as violence against women, close behind.

1 More than 150 major international companies subscribe to the LBG, which was founded in 1994 and is the global gold standard for the
classification of voluntary contributions made by companies in favor of the community. In accordance with the LBG model, in order to measure
and represent the Group’s commitment to the community, the contributions disbursed have been subdivided into three categories (charity,
investments in the community, initiatives in the community), adopting the customary pyramid-shaped representation. For further information,
see the sustainability section of the telecomitalia.com website, which contains further details about data for the last three years. The LBG
guidelines are considered a reference for the preparation of the statement for determining economic value generated and distributed. The graphic
provides more information than required by Legislative Decree 254/2016.
