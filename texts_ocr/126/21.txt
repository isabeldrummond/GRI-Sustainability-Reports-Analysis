The commitment of Fondazione TIM

The TIM Group companies are particularly attentive to the needs of the communities in which they operate and

implement wide-ranging initiatives and projects dedicated to their social and economic development. Fondazione TIM's

(FTIM) mission is to promote a culture of digital change and innovation, and thus integration, communication, economic

and social growth. FTIM can operate, in Italy and abroad, by the methods and with the tools that are considered

appropriate in each case for it to achieve its statutory purposes.

In accordance with this mission, four areas of intervention have been identified.

° Education: innovation in teaching and education, promoting initiatives aimed at updating the technology in Italian
schools and introducing radical innovations in educational methods and tools.

° Innovation Culture: a program of unconventional activities in the world of foundations for the purpose of promoting
aculture of innovation and becoming a point of reference for this.

° — Social Empowerment: non-profit-making organization are businesses. FTIM promotes both the better use of new
technologies and improved management and efficiency to help the organizations “do good well”.

° — Historic and Artistic Heritage: Italian artistic heritage represents excellence in the “technology of the past”. FTIM
wants to contribute to its enhancement and public use through present-day technology.

The monitoring system is
established according to the specific
characteristics and objectives of

requirement for all projects, whether

well as being an _ eligibility
requirement, it also provides an
assessment parameter.

In 2019, FTIM concentrated its resources on a number of important projects which allowed it to focus increasingly on
technological innovation to improve the solutions identified and broaden the range of beneficiaries. Thanks in part to the
push for open-source solutions, this will improve our impact on our national community exponentially.

In the realm of education, FTIM, CNR-ITD' and ANP? have launched the platform TRIS.2, the first -MOOC for training
teachers at all Italian schools on how to manage an inclusive, hybrid class, that is to say one in which some pupils may
have to be linked digitally from home. At the same time a Framework Agreement was signed with the MIUR to promote
participation in the course and monitor the results of its implementation.

Remaining in the field of Education, the collaboration between FTIM and Accademia della Scala continued. It is intended
to enhance and promote the work of one of Italy’s centers of excellence, and to innovate in the field of training, in order
to hand down valuable traditional trades, encourage young talent and get youngsters into the world of work; More
