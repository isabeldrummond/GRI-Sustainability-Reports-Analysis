Complaints and incidents

[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] The Group’s Code of Ethics and Conduct requires employees, collaborators and
consultants, as well as third parties who have business relations with the Group - in respect of activities and services of
interest to the Group - to promptly inform the Head of the TIM Audit Department, either directly or via their line manager,
of any violations or collusion to violate:

° legal or regulatory requirements,

° provisions of the Code of Ethics and Conduct,

° internal policies and procedures,

any irregularities and/or negligence.

The handling of reports above, also specifically those for which the Head of the Audit Department is responsible (known
as “whistleblowing”), is a requirement of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and - for some requirements - of the “UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights”; in Italy this particular case is regulated by Law No. 179/2017 (Provisions on the
protection of parties reporting offenses or irregularities they become aware of in the context of a public or private
employment relationship”).

The “Whistleblowing” procedure requires the Head of the Audit Department, who answers directly to the Board of
Directors, independently of the senior executives:

* to ensure that incoming complaints are received, logged and undergo preliminary analysis;
° based on the results of the preliminary analysis, to launch a structured audit activity (if required);

* to communicate the results of the analyses to the relevant departments so that they may take the appropriate
corrective actions (if required). The non-compliance is only closed once the Audit Department has verified the
effectiveness of the corrective actions implemented by the relevant departments;

* to ensure the traceability and retention of the documentation regarding the complaints received and their analysis;

* to update the reporting procedure and disseminate it internally together with the Human Resources, Organization &
Real Estate Department.

Employees were made aware of this in a letter from the CEO and a news item published on the company Intranet.

In 2019, a total of 165 complaints were received in Italy and 927 in Brazil. In the case of Italy, of the 165 complaints, 65
were anonymous and 100 non-anonymous - classified as follows:

° 75 inthe context of the “Whistleblowing” procedure!;

* 86 not covered by the procedure and sent to the relevant departments for the respective checks, informing the Audit
Department of the result; including:

1 For example: network coverage, relations with suppliers, health and safety of workers, presumed harassment and or discriminatory conduct;
those relating to Human Rights are detailed in this chapter's tables.
