[GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] Use of social networking in customer care

In recent years, TIM Customer Relationship Management has been increasingly focused on the monitoring of new digital
contexts, identifying the future of assistance, care and loyalty of its customers in the monitoring and management of
care contacts obtained from the social networks (Twitter and Facebook).

In 2010, TIM launched the Caring on Social Media project and, over the years, has built up a new relationship with digital
mobile and landline telephone customers, building trust by re-engineering and reviewing processes, developing
management systems, extending monitoring times and investing in the training of social caring agents.

With the projects already launched in 2017, aimed at both improving the service provided and monitoring quality in 2018,
TIM has strengthened its operational model through the use of a new social tool platform, for the integrated management
of all touch points, leading to further development in the operator’s functions and in controlling the main performance
indicators.

TIM continues with its strategy strongly oriented towards digitization and innovation, also offering new digital caring
channels to the customers’ advantage, who receive personalized and quick answers that improve customer experience,
loyalty and engagement.

At December 31, 2019, TIM’s social caring team managed 557K caring conversations on the Facebook page and 68K on
Twitter; in particular, the customer care demand on facebook amounted to 156K on the public page and 401K via private
message. The main reasons for contact with digital customers were requests for clarifications of a commercial,
administrative or technical assistance nature.

This has allowed TIM, also in the first months of 2019, to consolidate its leading role on social networks and also its digital
leadership in the Socialbaker rankings; TIM has positioned itself in first place as a brand in Italy in terms of social channel
response time and rate (AMIQ! indicator, a parameter calculated taking into account the relationship between the
number of managed public posts and the response time of the brand within 24 hours).

 

The contribution of social networks is also important for TIM to enhance and promote the many social, cultural and
innovative initiatives, such as the Mausoleum of Augustus project, the dissemination of the TIMHitech 5G project initial
results, numerous social issues (especially those overseen by the TIM Foundation) and support for publishing Corporate
Social Responsibility projects (e.g. the TIM Digital School and TIMSostiene).

All this has allowed TIM to consolidate its position at the top of the various communities, created on various social
networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube) for its main brands: TIM, TIM Business, TIMvision, TIMmusic, Working
Capital, with over 3.9 million likers and followers.

From July 2018, through the Instant Messaging channel in the new version of the MyTIM app, fixed and mobile consumer
customers have the opportunity to interact with customer service in a smart way; from 1 January to December 31, 2019,
the digital customer care team managed 2.4 million conversations via Instant Messaging.

From November 2018 TIM has also offered the new customer service channel on whatsapp (the first telephone operator
in Italy to offer this service). Initially, this assistance service was reserved for TIM Pay customers, the payment tool that
integrates telephone service with the innovative “mobile banking” solution (TIM Pay customers can receive dedicated
assistance with all TIM fixed and mobile services). It has now been extended to customers with concessiones (customers
who are blind and deaf)’. In future, whatsapp assistance will be progressively rolled out to other customoers and/or
services, for example sending invoices, notification of payment deadlines and many courtesy activities. From 1 January
to December 31, 2019, the digital customer care team managed 25K conversations via the whatsapp channel.
