* The data does not include the Domestic BU telephone poles because these are not disposed of as ordinary waste but under the framework
agreement signed in 2003 with the Ministry of the Environment and Land Protection, the Ministry of Production Activities and the production and
recovery companies, subject to the favorable opinion of the conference of State-Regions-Autonomous Provinces. In 2019, TIM decommissioned
162,303 poles weighing a total of 12,984 tons.

The data relating to waste shows a variable trend over time in relation to quantity and type of waste. The most significant
figure is that of the ratio of waste produced and that sent for recycling/recovery, which remains at a high level. ICT can
accelerate the obsolescence of products and require the resulting technological waste to be managed. TIM has entered
into contracts with companies specialised in handling used, faulty and end-of-life products, with the aim of reclaiming
components and raw materials and at the same time obtaining tangible economic benefits deriving from their recovery.
In 2019 the various management activities allowed logistics and network products (31,310 pieces) to be refurbished, while
components and raw materials (600,096 kg in total, almost exclusively fixed telephony parts) were recycled. In 2019, TIM
re-sold a total of 15,000 used mobile telephony items.

1“\Waste consigned” means waste delivered to carriers for recycling or reclamation or disposal.

?Slight variations compared to the situation on December 31 may occur until the following March 30, because the source of the data is the records
of waste loaded and unloaded, which are consolidated once the actual weight at destination has been verified; The information is supplied to the
producer of the waste within 3 months of consignment, which is the reason for the potential variations in the data. In this regard, ascertained
waste production for 2018 was lower (-10.12%) than stated in the last Report. However, this increase was not taken into account in the 2019 on
2018 comparison of waste produced.
