standards. TIM and the entire telecommunications sector pay careful attention to the issue by proactively monitoring all
possible developments and always acting in compliance with the legislation.

In Brazil the non-ionizing radiation emitted by the radio base stations of TIM Participagées are fully within the parameters
dictated by the World Health Organization and adopted by the Agéncia Nacional de Telecomunicagées (ANATEL). All the
radio base stations of TIM Participagdes have a license to operate issued by ANATEL.

[GRI 307-1] On the issue of Compliance, the Group provides everyone with a single channel through which to submit
requests for clarification or reports of presumed violation of environmental legislation, with the maximum guarantee of
confidentiality. The system assigns each report submitted a unique identification code, which enables the reporter to
check the processing status in complete anonymity?.

As active and responsible members of the community, the Group’s companies are committed to observing and ensuring
the observance of the laws in force in the countries in which they operate and adopt the organizational tools needed to
prevent the violation of legal provisions.

During 2019, no significant financial penalties were imposed on TIM in Italy for violations of environmental legislation in
the areas in which they perform their activities. This was also the case in the previous two years.

In Brazil during 2019 the Secretaria Municipal de Ambiente e Sustentabilidade - SEMAS fined TIM 50 thousand reais? for
not having the equipment installation licenses.

TIM initiatives for the environment

The concrete actions implemented by TIM in order to limit the impact of the company's activities on the environment are
outlined below.

Energy efficiency improvement work

TIM is intensifying its activities in the field of energy efficiency, implementing a series of major energy efficiency measures
that have led to savings of 128 GWh over the last three years (this is the cumulative value for the period).

In addition, the Group's monitoring platform was expanded over the course of 2019, in order to target management
interventions on all building types in a more effective manner. Sensors have been installed on 51 of the locations that
use the most energy, monitoring around 100 GWh. There are plans to extend monitoring to another 300 sites in 2020
(including all Data Centers, all POPs, all ISO 50001-certified sites, and all sites targeted by 2020 energy efficiency projects),
thus increasing the figure to 300 GWh. The target for 2020 is to monitor at least 50% of total consumption.

During 2019, TIM identified the most suitable levers for exploiting the energy potential of the company.

Renewable energy

An increase in the quantity of energy derived from renewable sources, both through the purchase of Guarantees of Origin
(covering around 21.4% of the total energy purchased in Italy) and through the construction of new photovoltaic plants,
with an installed power of around 10 MWp, and with expected energy production levels of 3 GWh in 2020 and around 13
GWh/year at full capacity. In the field of distributed generation, TIM plans significant development of renewable source
plants in the course of 2020, and will also launch testing of new sources for self-production at high-consumption sites.
For every 10 GWh of solar energy produced, a saving of 1ME€ is estimated. Specifically, the plans include:

e the installation of a photovoltaic system at the Acilia site during 2020 (baseline consumption: 8 GWh); the project is
currently under development;

e the construction of photovoltaic systems in 100 locations (number to be confirmed following detailed checks at local
level) in the area of exchanges/data centers (baseline consumption: 100 GWh/y).

? Pecuniary sanctions of an amount exceeding 500,000 euros are considered significant for the Group in Italy; For its own accounting purposes,
Brazil applies an amount of 500,000 reais, which is equal to 110,725 euros at the exchange rate on December 31, 2019.
