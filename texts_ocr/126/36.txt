TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE GROUP

In 2019, with the aim of knowing and analyzing the external vision with respect to the most relevant issues for its strategy,
TIM invited a selection of its stakeholders to register in the area reserved for consultation on the RE2N collaborative
platform. Specifically, this initiative is part of the new methodology adopted by TIM for materiality analysis (described in
the dedicated paragraph in this chapter) that leverages the potential of digital, including through sustainability activities.

Each initiative mentioned in the table provided in the Appendix includes a reference to the relevant chapter and section
of this report in which the initiative is discussed in detail.

Materiality Matrix

[GRI 102-46] In 2019, in compliance with Legislative Decree 254/2016 and the requirements of the Global Reporting
Initiative Standards, TIM conducted a materiality analysis with the aim of identifying the material topics as regards the
socio-environmental and economic impacts of the business activities both within and outside the Company.

Methodology

In keeping with the methodology started in 2017, TIM assessed the validity of the material issues identified the previous
year, validating or revising categories and definitions to make them more specific, adopting evolved semantic analysis!
techniques, to analyze a larger number of information sources and analyze big data and digital engagement, in order to
collect external points of view.

The process followed is in compliance with the “Guidelines for updating the TIM materiality analysis”, updated in 2017 in
line with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and was created and managed in collaboration with RE2N?, a
company that develops innovative tools for sustainability and shared value, using computational approaches to semantic
and big data analysis.

The SRM&R function held one-to-one meetings with the company's frontlines during which, in addition to presenting the
methodology and the path of materiality analysis starting from the 2018 matrix, it collected information and useful
indications on the tree of the topics to be evaluated. At the same time the taxonomy? to adopt in the semantic engine
was updated, using the same sustainability and digital references as those in 2017, in more recent versions and expanding
the number. In particular:

e Global Reporting Initiative Standard, ISO 26000, Sustainable Development Goals and specialist assessments’;

e Italian Digital Agenda, Objectives of the European Digital Single Market and dedicated indexes®, besides regulatory

references which are relevant for TIM and its stakeholders.

At the same time, the documents linked to the Group’s core business were updated and integrated with new
documentary sources for analysis, selecting Italian and international, public and non-public sources, internal and external
to TIM®.

The semantic engine analyses all the sources of information with different interactions. This process led to the definition
of a list of themes based on the occurrences’ found in the various documents and the logical correlations between them.

‘The techniques involve automatic text analyses designed to extract structural data which codify the semantic component of textual content.

The algorithms of the semantic engine that analyses all the sources of information were trained with “sustainability” and “digital” components.

3 Each taxonomy is made up of interrelated concepts and keywords with different correlation and significance levels. Each taxonomy was

constructed using both Italian and English terms.

*“ For example RobecoSam (Dow Jones Sustainability Index), FTSE4good and Sustainalytics questionnaires.

5 For example, the Digital Economy Society Index which monitors different aspects of the digitization level of the individual European countries.

®For example: The Italian government's “Piano nazionale italiano per l’Agenda 2030” ("Italian national plan for the 2030 Agenda"), the “Ernst &
Young Megatrends report 2018”, the “Fair and Sustainable Well-Being in Italy 2018” (BES) report promoted by the National Council for
Economy and Labour (CNEL) and the National Institute for Statistics (ISTAT).

7 The occurrences identify the number of times that a concept (or a specific term) is detected within the document by the semantic engine and

provide an indication of the significance of the topic detected in the context of the document.
