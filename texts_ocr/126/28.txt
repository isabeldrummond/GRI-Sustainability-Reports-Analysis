TIM Sustainability Report 2019
THE GROUP

To ensure that the choices made regarding remuneration are appropriately investigated, in accordance with the rules on
transparency and the strict regulations on potential conflicts of interest, the Board of Directors relies on the support of
the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. In performing its duties, the Committee (the meetings of which are
attended by the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors or, if he/she is unavailable, by another Auditor appointed
by him/her) relies on the assistance provided by appropriate structures of the Company and can also rely on the support
of external consultants whose position does not compromise their independence of judgement.

[GRI 102-35] With the exception of the Chairman and the CEO, the Directors receive fixed remunerations only. The
“Remuneration paid to members of the management and control body and key managers with strategic responsibilities”
table in the RR states all the types and amounts of remuneration received by each director. Details of the fixed and
variable remuneration components (including any stock option), benefits and severance pay attributed to the CEO, the
Chairman and the key managers with strategic responsibilities are illustrated in detail in the Remuneration Report (for
directors with strategic responsibilities the data is aggregate). In particular, the objectives assigned to the Chairman and
CEO for 2019 are mainly of an economic and financial nature.

The sustainability targets used to determine the management incentive system are stated in the Remuneration Policies
section of the TIM People section of this report.

Sustainability governance system

GRI 102-18] [GRI 102-26] Monitoring of the Group’s socio-environmental matters, as well as the identification of
sustainability initiatives and projects, lie with the Sustainability Reporting, Monitoring and Relationship Department,
hereinafter “SRMR” - for Administration & Financial Statements and Sustainability Reporting (“AFSSR”) - and the
Corporate Digital Communication & CSV Projects Department, which reports to the Head of Institutional Communication.

GRI 102-32] The AFSSR department of the Chief Executive Office reports to the CEO on the matter of the Sustainability
Report/Consolidated Non-Financial Statement, including the materiality analysis, and periodically reports to the Internal
Control and Risk Committee. The latter acts as a corporate sustainability and corporate social responsibility overseer,
ensuring the consistency of actions carried out with the principles of the Group’s Code of Ethics and Conduct, which
expresses the values adopted by the Group and reference regulations.

GRI 102-31] During 2019, the Board of Directors met with those responsible for sustainability activities in February for the
approval of the Sustainability Report, in addition to three meetings in December, one of which was conducted by Prof.
Enrico Giovannini, as previously reported.

GRI 102-19] Socio-environmental responsibilities are delegated, in the same way as all other powers delegated by the
company, by applying the procedure granting and revoking powers. In particular, [GRI 102-20] responsibility for monitoring
and communicating environmental and social issues rests with the SRMR Department, which apart from drawing up the
Sustainability Report, manages relations with rating agencies. Responsibility for managing individual socio-environmental
themes remains with the departments that directly manage operations relating to these themes. [GRI 102-26] These
latter departments in particular identify specific strategies and targets for improving socio-environmental performance,
each in its own area of responsibility.

 

[GRI 102-21] Responsibility for dialog with stakeholders is delegated to the departments that are operationally responsible
for dealing with the Company’s stakeholders.
