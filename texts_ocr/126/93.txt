Skills evaluated
in the Performance Review

Below are the main development activities that defined 2019:

Onboarding: for welcoming new recruits to the Company (junior staff, professionals and managers), to speed up their
“time to perform” and encourage engagement and “intent to stay”. In 2019 a further refinement based on feedback
collected through monitoring tools (individual interviews, surveys) was carried out in order to increase the
engagement of all involved.

Performance Management: the process involves the evaluation of the goals and responsibilities of the entire
workforce (managers, professionals and office workers) and is divided into five phases (assignment of objectives,
evaluation, mid-year review, evaluator’s selection, feedback). In the first four months of this year the entire 2018
Performance Management process was concluded which involved the entire Domestic Business Unit (around 47,000
people): [GRI 404-3] 99.3% of people were evaluated by their direct superior and 82% stated that they received
feedback from their superior. Performance Management 2019 was launched in May of that year with a phase of goal
assignment, and was completed in June. At the beginning of September, the mid-year review phase started with the
aim of giving people the opportunity to integrate the assigned objectives panel with new activities that emerged
during the year. The phase ended at the end of October and involved 27% of people.
