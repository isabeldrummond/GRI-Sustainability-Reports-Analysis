documentary evidence procedures, in order to collect information about the processes and
procedures that support the collection, aggregation, processing and transmission of non-
financial data and information to the management responsible for the preparation of the DNF.

Furthermore, for significant information, considering the Group activities and characteristics:

- at Group level

a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the DNF, and in particular
to the business model, policies implemented and main risks, we carried out
inquiries and acquired supporting documentation to verify its consistency with the
available evidence;

b) with reference to quantitative information, we have performed both analytical
procedures and limited assurance procedures to ascertain on a sample basis the
correct aggregation of data.

Conclusions

Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe

prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the requirements of articles 3 and 4 of the
Decree and the GRI Standards.
