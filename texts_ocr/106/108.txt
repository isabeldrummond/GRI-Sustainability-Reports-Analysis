Since 2012, Prysmian has implemented specific recruiting programmes that have helped to diversify the offer
portfolio, not only with “Spot” job offers but also with programmes to attract and retain talent.

Build the Future. the Graduate Program
45 young graduates from about 40,000 candidates

“Build the Future, the Graduate Program” is an international programme in its ninth edition for the recruit-
ment and induction of new graduates. The objective is to place young graduates with high-potential profiles
in various functions and geographical areas. The Graduate Program comprises various stages, from a careful
selection process to the assignment of an important technical or managerial role after 3 years.

During the first half of 2019, 45 new international staff were taken on, while, inthe second half of 2019, over
40,000 applications were received. This will lead to the selection and recruitment of another 50/60 new gra-
duates in 2020.

Make It
56 young engineers from about 19,000 candidates

The “Make It” international recruitment programme is aimed at identifying engineers from other sectors to
cover highly challenging key roles in the Group's most important production plants. The main objective is to
introduce new skills, augmented by diversity in terms of culture and background, that can contribute to the
process of cultural change and recognition that is blossoming throughout Prysmian.

In addition to a period of training (On-Boarding & Training on the Job) for approximately two months, lea-
ding to placement in the specific role in the local unit, further steps in the “Make It” programme include the
assignment of a corporate mentor and continuous technical training. Via this programme, participants can
expect career development based on the evaluation of their performance and potential.

The programme led to the hiring of around 200 engineers from around the world between 2016 and 2019.
With assistance from Korn Ferry, a new global partner, the programme received a major boost in 2019 with
the recruitment of about 56 engineers and the receipt of about 19,000 job applications. Here too, efforts
were made to draw on and differentiate the experiences offered by candidates, as well as their diverse back-
grounds, in order to broaden the interactions among different leadership styles and types of know-how.

Sell It
17 salespeople from about 10,000 candidates

The “Sell It” programme aims to further the growth and development of the sales force and follows the same
steps as the “Make it” programme, commencing from the careful selection of candidates (application, test,
group assessment, group and local interviews). This year, “Sell It” attracted about 10,000 applications and
led to the recruitment of 17 salespeople, with about 5 years of experience, interested in covering key and
highly challenging roles in various Energy & Telecom business areas.

Once again, this programme assisted by Korn Ferry has proved strategic and highly effective.

The communication materials and campaign details for both Make It and Sell it have been revised, in order to
improve the effectiveness of the recruiting system.

Consistent with the people strategy, the talent acquisition priorities for 2020 will continue to focus on the
employer branding strategy and the employee value proposition, linked to the Group's values and leadership
model. The objective is to make the unique offer made by the Group, in terms of experience, culture, benefits
and growth, both visible and transparent to persons who are already part of the Prysmian Group and those
who will be in future. In addition, we will continue to give priority to the quality of recruitment and the diver-
sity of backgrounds and skills.
