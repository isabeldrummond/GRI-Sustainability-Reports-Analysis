Prysmian People Performance Potential (P4)

 

In 2017, with a view to rationalising the assessment of potential and establishing a process for the identifica-
tion of talent and the preparation of succession plans, Prysmian introduce a structured process known as the
“Prysmian People Performance Potential (P4)”. This process was renewed in 2019 to include General Cable top
performers, to ensure definition of the proper perimeter and guarantee recognition of the various talents.

In order to guarantee a proper level of awareness about the new models, more than 2,500 managers around the
world received training between February and the end of March 2019. During 2019, about 16%’ of the Group's
white-collar workers (including the front line) were subjected to periodic appraisals of their professional deve-
lopment and potential.

On launch of the new Workday system in 2020, the new content defined in 2019 for performance (P3) and scou-
ting for potential (P4) will be confirmed and supported by a potential simplification of the process. Particular
attention will be given to the management of feedback downstream from the talent committee. Specifically,
ad hoc training will be made available. Alongside this, a new system for the assessment of high potential indi-
viduals will become available, supporting both employees and the Group with a targeted development plan.

Together with the Compensation team, we are working to align the reward element with the recognition of talent.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

The development of people is a priority at Prysmian. In this regard, the Prysmian Group Academy has been crea-
ted at Group level to guide and define the pillars of the development strategy.

In order to develop and consolidate the leadership and technical skills of management, the Prysmian
Group Academy comprises 3 modular schools (Prysmian Business School, Prysmian Professional School and
Prysmian Digital School) that provide training both to a selected pool and to all employees, based on our
business requirements.
