So it is necessary to develop a grid that facilitates a cost-effective energy transition, maintaining adequate
resources while, at the same time, enabling system operators to cope with variable models of consumption
and demand. Ina “No Grid” scenario by 2040, ENTSO-E has shown that failure to invest in the transmission sy-
stem could increase the marginal price by 3% -29%, depending on the region, and endanger the security of the
electricity supply as well.

Inconcrete terms, it will only be possible to achieve the objectives set recently by the European Commission and
the UN SDGs for the coming decade if efforts are made to lower the production cost of renewables to the level
enjoyed by fossil fuels.

The Prysmian Group seeks to be the go-to technology player in this scenario, facilitating the production and
transmission of cleaner, more intelligent and more efficient and competitive energy, so that power can be tran-
sferred from the location of renewable production (offshore wind farms) to the place of consumption (commu-
nities and urban centres).

Cable technology will be decisive in this scenario, making it possible to improve the grids needed for this energy
transition, while optical fibre will enable the digitalisation of society as an essential step in the development of
a low-carbon economy and a new growth model.

The Prysmian Group promotes cable solutions that support the move towards this low-carbon economy, with
positive effects on climate change. Indeed, in 2019, 48% of total Group revenues were attributable, based on
the Climate Bond Initiative taxonomy, to products that facilitate achievement of the target set by COP 21 in the
2015 Paris Agreements and, in general, an energy transition that contributes to the decarbonisation of the eco-
nomy and the digitalisation of networks.
