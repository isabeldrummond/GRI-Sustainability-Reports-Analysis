Logistics and transport

As regards transport, Prysmian not only gives preference to local suppliers but is also committed to optimi-
sing the transport of goods by air and by sea, as well as to selecting road hauliers that seek to implement
sustainable policies and actions.

The cost of road transport - the most frequently used - is considered as a proxy and since it is the one with the
greatest environmental impact, the Group has implemented aseries of actions aimed at monitoring CO, emis-
sions deriving from the transport of products.

The optimisation of the distribution chain at the operational macro-region level is ongoing and continued in
2019, with a particular focus on the consolidation of warehouses/distribution centres and the outsourcing of
logistics services in order to lower distribution costs.

In particular, the number of stock-holding locations in North America has declined from 77 to 64, with the
closure of the Hutchinson and Axsun distribution centres, together with 10 satellite locations. In the UK, the
Oil&Gas Distribution Centre Oil&Gas in Aberdeen has been closed, as has the Vestby distribution centre in
Norway. A further 3 satellite locations have also been closed in Europe.

Various logistics outsourcing projects were completed in recent years, with consolidation at regional level.

REDUCTION OF CO, EMISSIONS AND GREENROUTER PROJECT

In the United States, Prysmian North America continued the partnership with Smartway, the US environmental
protection agency (EPA) that helps companies to measure and compare the sustainability levels of its Supply
Chain, as well as improve the efficiency of the transport system. The partnership has been extended to the Gene-
ral Cable perimeter.

Logistics suppliers in various countries have started to monitor the CO, emissions associated with their transpor-
tation activities, pressured by national regulations and, above all, upon requested by the Prysmian supply chain.

In addition, the GreenRouter tool has been implemented to measure the climate impact of the Prysmian HQ lo-
gistics chain. This tool allows the carbon footprint of organisations to be measured and assessed, recommending
strategies for minimising their supply chain emissions. The methodology used by the tool to calculate transpor-
tation emissions is checked in conformity with UNI EN 16258 and the calculation of emissions is accredited to be in
conformity with the GLEC (Global Logistics Emissions Council) framework by the SFC (Smart Freight Centre).

The pilot project has been completed for the Italian company and implementation is in progress at the UK and
Netherlands companies.

METHODS OF TRANSPORTATION

As in prior years, ground transportation was the main type of transport used by the Group in 2019. The Group
used road transport together with rail transport for the route between China and Europe (New Trans-Siberian).
