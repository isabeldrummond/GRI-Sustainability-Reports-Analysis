Prysmian Group I Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 43

 

INNOVATION ECO-SYSTEM

When carrying out research, the Prysmian Group is aware that today - as evidenced by the SDGs - it is essential to
develop partnerships with all relevant stakeholders: from the academic world to independent research centres,
from suppliers and all supply chain counterparties to our customers, whose collaboration and feedback are ex-
tremely important for the identification of those requirements that need the greatest attention.

Accordingly, in order to work on innovation and carry out research, the Prysmian Group has created an eco-sy-
stem in close contact with customers and suppliers, as well as with the best universities in the world, in order to
focus the objectives when releasing synergies and collaborating in the areas of innovation of greatest interest
for their environmental impact and the evolution of the sector.
