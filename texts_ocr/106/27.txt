Sustainability in Prysmian Group

SUSTAINABILITY IS IN OUR DNA

Sustainability plays a central role for the Prysmian Group, committed
to promoting a business model that integrates economic, social and
environmental responsibility in all aspects and activities ofthe Group.

The Prysmian Group promotes a business model based on the concept of shared value through a strategic appro-
ach that considers the following elements to be key: listening to and actively involving all internal and external
stakeholders, dedicating constant attention to the evolving global and industry context, and planning for the
future in a responsible manner that considers the environment and society.

The strength of this approach is the constant monitoring of the Group's sustainability performance along the
entire value chain, with the aim not only of assessing performance ex post, but also of developing a proactive
attitude in decision-making processes, able to anticipate and seize the new opportunities. ESG (Environmental,
Social and Governance) matters are absolutely integral to the sustainability strategy adopted by the Group, whi-
ch has four main aspects:

PUBLIC COMPANY

We are a public company and, as such, it is fundamental to align the interests of the Group with those of our
stakeholders. We have always maintained open and transparent dialogue with our shareholders, employees,
customers and suppliers, the institutions and the communities in which we work. In order to ensure their confi-
dence and support, we strive to maintain high governance standards and practices: for example, 67% of Board
members are independent. As a public company, the shareholders’ meetings of the Prysmian Group provide an
important opportunity for discussion, involvement and agreement among all shareholders. Participation is li-
vely and proactive. For example, the meeting held to approve the 2018 financial statements was attended by
more than 1,530 shareholders, in person or by proxy, representing 61% of the share capital of Prysmian Group.
In addition, our open and transparent relations with the market and investors translate into over 500 meetings
each year, as wellas other contacts.

Integrity as a corporate value is expressed using a series of instruments: the Code of Ethics, the anti-corruption
policy, privacy and data protection, and the Helpline programme for reporting actual, apparent or potential in-
fringements of the law. Prysmian Group is a company made of people: out of 29,000 employees, more than
9,200, owning about 1.5% of the share capital, have subscribed to the “YES” share ownership programme - inve-
sting directly and expressing their confidence in the Company.
