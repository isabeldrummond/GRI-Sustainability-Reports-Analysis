80 | Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019

 

The results of the analysis show:
e alowoverall exposure to the risks deriving from the change in precipitation in summer and winter;

e alow overall exposure to the risks deriving from the increase in temperatures, with the exception of a very
few plants in areas with amaximum expected increase in temperatures of +1.5°C;

e anexposure to risks related to a potentially significant rise in sea levels (>0.5 metres), affecting about 10%
of the Group's plants positioned close to the sea.

This last point was also confirmed by a further analysis that took into account the risk of coastal flooding (storm
surges), estimated using the same methodology and utilising the Swiss RE “CatNet” online platform.

Prysmian has meanwhile developed a methodology to check actual risk exposure by examining the physical
data and information for each plant in order to quantify the potential impact on business operations.

Risks related to the availability of water

In order to carry out its business activities, the Group requires the continuous availability of water to cool se-
mi-finished products. This water is recirculated, entirely or partially according to circumstances, to avoid exces-
sive consumption. The unavailability of water could therefore jeopardise the continuity of company processes.
In order to better understand and attempt to quantify the potential risk exposure, the Prysmian Risk Manage-
ment functions and Group HSE performed an analysis of the water risk for its plants in 2017.

The analysis considered water stress (defined as the ratio between water demand and available water) in the
year 2030 and the changes in water supply and water demand projected for 2030 with reference to all regions
of the earth's surface. Using the “Aqueduct” tool provided by the World Resources Institute (WRI), the Group
analysed the geographical positioning of the Group's plants in order to identify which of them could be exposed
to water risk and, therefore, to the risk associated with reduced water availability. The results of the analysis
show that about 20% of the Group's plants are located in areas extremely exposed to the risk of water stress,
estimated by 2030. For all plants in the Prysmian perimeter for which a potential risk has been evidenced, it
must also be borne in mind that current production processes involve, for most plants, water recycling aimed at
reduced consumption.

During 2019, Prysmian extended the analysis using the “Aqueduct” tool to the former General Cable plants, de-
termining that the percentage of sites located in areas exposed to water stress risk, based on estimates for 2030,
is essentially unchanged at about 20%.

Risks related to the sustainability of the Group supply chain

The Group's business model, with a global presence in over 50 countries and a high diversification of product
applications, is based on a complex supply chain that requires a continuous interface with numerous suppliers
of different sizes and cultural background. In addition to acommitment to the evaluation of counterparties, the
Group has adopted guidelines and policies that suppliers are required to comply with and accept (for example,
the Code of Ethics and the Code of Business Conduct).

There will be an immediate reaction should it emerge that third parties involved in the supply chain have im-
plemented actions not conforming to the principles of environmental and social sustainability, which would
expose the Group to potentially significant image and reputational risks. If the issues flagged are not promptly
corrected and eliminated, the Group reserves the right to activate a procedure for the termination of existing
business activities and temporary, or in serious cases, definitive exclusion from the Group's supplier list.

The assessment of risks related to the sustainability of third parties is a fundamental step in the entire supply
chain management process and defines clear rules for i) the introduction of new suppliers, ii) the periodic eva-
luation of the supply chain, iii) the monitoring and improvement of the supply chain management strategy.
