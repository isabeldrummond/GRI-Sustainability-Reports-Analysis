I Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 7

 

The incentive scheme for all managers within the Prysmian Group is linked to the achievement of objecti-
ves for the improvement of our ESG parameters. The Compensation, Appointments and Sustainability
Committee is responsible for assessing the performance of the Group against these criteria. When as-
sessing performance in 2019, the Committee will make reference to the positioning of the Group in the
Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the CDP Index and the EcoVadis index, to the gender diversity of manage-
ment, to the reduction of CO, emissions and to topics related to occupational health and safety.

The ESG criteria are fully integrated into the industrial strategy of the Prysmian Group. Indeed, we
have adopted a scorecard that enables us to manage social and environmental matters as a part of
our business activities. This scorecard contains 14 clear and measurable objectives with a business
impact. Our international presence, in 50 countries around the world, has heavily influenced our di-
versity in terms of culture, gender and age. Starting from 2016, we have introduced various suitable
initiatives designed to build on this extraordinary characteristic, such as the “Side by Side” project
- for the creation of value consistent with our business objectives - and the Women Leadership Pro-
gramme, which provides training to our female talents and has helped to raise the percentage of
women in executive positions to 12% (10.8% in 2018).

Lastly, from September 2019 the Prysmian Group is included - as the only company in the cables sector - in
the Dow Jones Sustainability World index. Tracking 2,700 businesses, this is the most important interna-
tional index for the assessment of performance in environmental, social and governance (ESG) terms.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

Our commitment to responding to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in early 2020
was immediate. The Group can count on a broad geographic distribution of its production sites and an
extensive diversification of its end markets. Top priority has been given to protecting the health of em-
ployees by implementing strict health and safety measures for plants and offices and making extensi-
ve use of remote working.

Given this situation, the Group’s management has made it a priority to ensure the greatest possible
continuity of its supply chain and operations, to protect its business and ability to generate cash-flows,
and to adopt all possible cost containment and cash flow protection measures.

At its meeting on 30 March 2020 to review the effects of the changed macroeconomic and market
scenario caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the global level, the Board of Directors
confirmed the assessments made at its meeting of 5 March 2020 regarding the Group's ability to gene-
rate cash flows and sustain a balanced long-term dividend policy and believes its financial structure,
liquidity and available credit lines are entirely adequate to respond to the new economic and financial
situation emerging from the ongoing health emergency.

However, in light of the spread of the pandemic and its potential duration, and given the uncertainty
surrounding the terms and geographical extent of the restrictions to production and logistics around
the world, as well as the slowdown that it could cause on the demand and the economic cycle, the Bo-
ard of Directors has deemed it prudent to modify the proposed allocation of 2019 profits to be submit-
ted in the forthcoming Shareholders’ Meeting called for 28 April 2020.

To conclude, I can confirm that the Group remains closely focused on pursuing sustainable growth
strategies, even ina macroeconomic and market scenario that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is
undergoing profound change.
