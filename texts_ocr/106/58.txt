Terrestrial cables

In developing extra high voltage cables systems, a fundamental objective was achieved on successful completion at CESI La-
boratories (Mannheim) of the pre-qualification tests for 525 kV HVDC applications for the corridors project in Germany. Two
cabled systems, the related accessories and the various installation solutions have been qualified: XLPE and P-Laser, both
HVDC, with operational temperatures of 70° and 90°C respectively. Following this significant result, Prysmian is the only cable
manufacturer qualified with two different solutions that comply in full with the high standards set by the German transmis-

sion system operators (TSO).

In order to advance the industrialisation of these extra high voltage (EHVDC) cables, Gron plant has completed the pilot pro-
duction of 10 km of 525 kV cable at full size with a section area of 3,000 mm? (copper conductor). With regard to the P-Laser
technology for HVDC application, a long series of improvements have been made to, for example, storage of the materials,
extreme cleanliness during handling and the dosage and extrusion processes. Gron plant has also introduced new devices
for the industrial production of solutions that apply this technology. As part of developing the EHVDC systems, Livorno plant
has completed the production of full-scale prototypes of the new generation of accessories (up to 640 kV), with a dedicated
industrial line.

Two development solutions are applied in order to satisfy the need to increase the energy transported. The first is to develop
EHVAC systems: the first series of tests on the laboratory prototype was completed during 2019 and the results will be used
in 2020 to continue the development phase, with a view to producing full-scale prototypes in 2021. The second solution is to
develop copper and aluminium conductors with large sections, with lower losses due to the skin and proximity effects. Copper
conductors with section areas up to 3,000 and 3,500 mm? have been tested; industrial production is now feasible, with impro-
vements in the loss reduction due to the skin effect. An efficient alternative would be the use of aluminium conductors with
very large section areas of up to 4,000-4,500 mm”. Additionally, in certain specific cases, some TSOs actually prefer larger
aluminium conductors instead of traditional cables with copper conductors, since they weigh less and the investment cost is

 

 

 

lower. There are in fact numerous, well-known arguments t
