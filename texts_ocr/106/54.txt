RATIONALISATION AND MANAGEMENT OF MATERIALS

Work on the approval of alternative materials, especially those of major technical or commercial importance,
is continuing throughout the Group to reduce the use of single suppliers. The new version for the preparation
of supply specifications (PrySpec) is currently being introduced in all countries where the Group operates. In
addition, the compounds database (CompounDS) has been supplemented by including all compounds normally
purchased by the Group. Anew formulations database has been created to manage more effectively the use and
distribution of compounds at Group level.

MONITORING OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES

Development work is progressing in France on asystem for the monitoring of hazardous substances, witha view
to report their presence (classified in accordance with the REACH/RoHS regulations) in all products managed
using CA/SAP, and warning about any concentration of hazardous substances that exceeds the maximum allowed
threshold. The system is based ona special routine developed in SAP that makes possible to carry out a detailed
analysis of the materials (BOM) comprising the product and identify any hazardous substances. This analysis is
made possible by applying a specific flag to the raw materials used to produce cables, ina given country, which
contains an hazardous substance. Obviously enough, the first task is to gather the necessary information from
suppliers about the possible presence of hazardous substances in their raw materials. This information can be
obtained from the material safety data sheets (MSDS) or froma specific declaration released by the supplier.

The system is already in use in France and can provide this type of information, on demand, for a specific product
ora limited series of products. If the concentration of hazardous materials exceeds the maximum allowed thre-
shold, a specific declaration is prepared for the end customer.

The system is now being extended to other countries in southern Europe (Italy and Spain) and to Germany. The-
se countries are currently collecting information from the suppliers of raw materials, with a view to activating
the SAP system in early 2020. This new SAP system may also be applied in other regions/countries during 2020.
