| Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 147

 

In 2019, work continued on the mapping, classification and involvement of suppliers, in order to assess the prin-
cipal parameters affecting sustainability:

e Integrity: fair trade, conflicts of interest, gifts and entertainment, bribery and corruption.
e Human and workers’ rights: under-age working, health and safety, non-discrimination.

e Environment: use of raw materials, use of energy and carbon dioxide emissions, water consumption and as-
sociated risks.

e Mining activities and conflict minerals: resettlement, closure plans and sustainable use of land.

With regard to the work performed in relation to the suppliers of raw materials other than base metals, the
Group has undertaken initiatives focusing on:

e stability and continuity of production processes: new system for the collection of data and the monitoring of
supplier service levels.

e under-age working ethics: special initiative addressing mica suppliers.

Prysmian monitors supplier service levels, with the main goal of reducing the risk of disruption of supply of pur-
chased raw materials through a report produced jointly by the Purchasing, Logistics and Quality functions. This
instrument is used ona monthly basis to ensure levels of service across the European perimeter, with the aim of
implementing it in the other regions.

As the 2019 suppliers of base metals were unchanged with respect to 2018, work focused - especially via the
sustainability audits - on sample checks of the data declared in their self-assessment questionnaires against the
practices and procedures actually followed.

In order to increase the attention paid to ESG factors by employees and, more specifically, those in the purcha-
sing department, since 2015 the Prysmian Group has included a section in the annual Purchasing Academy de-
dicated to the sustainability of the supply chain. Each year since 2015, about 30 buyers (11% of the Prysmian
purchasing organisation) are invited from all parts of the world for training on ESG matters. In addition, from
2017, asection dedicated to sustainability has been included in the World-Wide Purchasing Leadership Meeting,
which is an annual event attended by exponents of the purchasing organisation.

A RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO MICA MINING

In order to manufacture certain safety cables and make them fire resistant, Prysmian purchases limited quan-
tities of a few types of glass-based tape that contain small quantities of mica, but we do not use this mineral
directly in our products and production processes. The extraction process for this mineral is considered to be
at risk of under-age working, especially in geographical areas like India and Madagascar where large quantities
are mined. The Group tackled this issue during 2016 by requesting all suppliers of products with a sub-supply of
mica to complete a questionnaire certifying the absence of child labour anywhere in the supply chain. In 2019,
the Group continued analysing the results collected through the questionnaires sent to suppliers with the aim of
developing increased monitoring aimed at avoiding the use of suppliers at potential risk of child labour in their
supply chain.
