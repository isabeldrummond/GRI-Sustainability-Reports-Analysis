In 2019, around 10% of the raw materials used were recycled materials.

45 The calculation of the percentage excludes data relating to Italian and Corporate suppliers. The 2018 data related to the Prysmian Group w/o General Cable. By contrast,
the 2019 date relates to the Prysmian Group. The calculation methodology adopted in 2018 was used for the legacy Prysmian plants and the former General Cable plants
except, in the latter case, for those located in North America, for which precise calculations were made with reference to the location of the supplier.
