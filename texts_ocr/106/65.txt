Protection of intellectual
property

Protecting the portfolio of patents and trademarks is a key part of the Group's business, particularly in relation
toits strategy of growth in high-tech market segments. The Group filed new patent applications during the year,
especially in segments with higher added value and in support of the significant investments made in recent
years. At 31 December 2019, the Prysmian Group has a larger number of patents and patent applications under
examination globally than in the prior year. This is because more patents were filed than those that expired or
were abandoned because no longer of interest.

The number of inventions covered by at least one patent or patent application has increased slightly. The rise
was greater in the Energy sector, with aslight decline in the Telecom sector. This statistic reflects a good increase
inthe number of inventions in the Energy sector, which offset the number of patents that expired or were aban-
doned. There was a slight fall in the number of inventions covered by at least one patent or patent application in
he Telecom sector, which has historically owned a larger number of inventions than the Energy sector, because
he portfolio of Telecom patents comprises a considerable number of old patents that resulted from the earlier
rush to patent optical fibre technologies.

A total of 41 patent applications were filed during 2019, of which 17 relating to the Energy sector and 24 to the
Telecom sector. The reduction in the number of new filings is a natural effect of the merger of Prysmian Group
and General Cable. This decline was also noted in the past, when Prysmian absorbed Draka.

The number of patents granted during the year was essentially the same as in the prior year, with an increase in
hose granted by the US patents office. In view of the different examination procedures followed in the various
countries/regions and their timing, no significant conclusions can be drawn from the above information.

Prysmian Group owns a significant number of trademarks deriving from the pre-existing Prysmian Group and
he pre-existing General Cable group. This portfolio is currently being revised and optimised, in line with the
brand protection policies adopted by the Prysmian Group following the merger.

 

As aconsequence, the total number of trademarks and registrations fellin 2019. The trademarks of the Prysmian
Group protect the main brands and the most important products, typically involving specific characteristics or
production processes that enable them to be identified in the marketplace and guarantee their uniqueness.
