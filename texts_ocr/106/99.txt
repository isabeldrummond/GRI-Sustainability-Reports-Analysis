| Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019

 

The six main initiatives (streams) were completed during 2019.

1.

IS Metrics and Indicators: definition of a series of key performance and risk metrics and indicators (30 busi-

ness oriented and 50 more technically driven) for mon

. General Cable Integration: a series of activities in support of the acquisition process, assessing the level of
maturity and formalising a development plan for alignment with Group practices. These assessments have
been carried out in relation to the LATAM and NA regions. As part of the integration program, two vulnerabi-
lity assessment and penetration test initiatives were also completed in 2019: one at the US HQ and the other
at the most important EMEA plant.

 

. IS Culture: alongside established initiatives (multi-channel awareness campaigns) to promote a culture of
security among all Group employees, a range of mandatory training courses was introduced during 2019 for
new hires and in relation to specific initiatives, such as the adoption of second factor authentication. The
purpose of this training is to improve behaviour in response to threats and cyber attacks that exploit the ha-
bits and expectations of users, making them more responsible for helping to protect corporate information,
both in the office and when on business trips.

The cyber security programme will continue in the coming years and new initiatives have already been planned,
in accordance with the strategy agreed at Group level. This strategy was revised and updated in 2019 following
the acquisition of General Cable, resulting in additions to the existing roadmap.

Security initiatives are also key elements in the integration of Group companies. They commenced in 2011 with
the acquisition of Draka and continued in 2018 on the purchase of General Cable: companies that basically had
different architectures to be harmonised. Programs for the secure redesign of plant data networks (network
segregation and segmentation programme) and the application of security frameworks are therefore becoming
even more important.

The process for managing the risks associated with information security was approved and released at the be-
ginning of 2019. It is based on the ISO/IEC 27005 international standard and extends the existing general pro-
cess for the management of business risks adopted by the Group. This process attaches proper importance to
security measures, linking them with known threats and risks, and draws on the results of the analysis driven by
the Threat Model.

After this analysis, any unacceptable risks will be mitigated by defining and implementing risk management
actions, which will be appropriately prioritised with reference to the levels of risk identified.

The risks associated with third parties (Group suppliers) were also considered during 2019, including the out-
sourcing services that support critical IT systems and operations and increase risk and the extent of vulnerabi-
lities. This potential source of cyber attacks is evolving and expanding significantly, making additional require-
ments necessary for the supervision and monitoring of security at the third parties used by the Group.
