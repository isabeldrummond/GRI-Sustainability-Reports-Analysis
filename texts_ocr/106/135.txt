PERCENTAGE OF PROCESS WATER RECIRCULATED

Process water - e.g. that used to cool semi-finished products - is recirculated at numerous plants, in whole or
in part depending on the situation, in order to avoid excessive consumption. In order to better understand the
degree of efficiency achieved in the use of water, the application of the methodology, devised in collaboration
with the Merlino plant, to determine the “percentage of water recirculated” with respect to total water consu-
mption has been extended. The concept is based on how much is saved (compared with not having a recircu-
lation plant) in relation to the total quantity of water consumed for processing reasons (due to evaporation,
occasional emptying of the circuit, or the lack or only partial installation of a recirculation plant).

With regard to the Prysmian Group, it was possible to acquire information on 80% of plants, with results showing
that almost all of the production units possess recovery systems; with water recirculation percentages of up to
99% in 45% of cases, between 90% and 99% in another 45% of cases, and less than 90% in 10% of cases“’, with
scope for improvement. The percentages stated above may of course change as application of the formula is
extended to other plants, in order to obtain full coverage of the Group.

We began to collect data in 2019 about the quantity of water returned to surface reservoirs. This data was only
provided by a limited number of operating units and, accordingly, was not considered representative at Group
level. It has not been reported in this document.

IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES

Various initiatives to improve environmental management were implemented during the year, including:

e LaPointe - Canada: reduction in the consumption of water by perfecting an automatic dosage system that
reduces the frequency of discharging and refilling.

e Montereau (France): an action plan to reduce waste from the extruder was implemented successfully.

e Tetla (Mexico): energy consumption was reduced by the optimisation of machine start-ups and the hours
of maximum usage. In addition, water consumption was reduced by daily monitoring.

e Paragould: the installation of an evaporator drastically reduced emulsion waste.

e Claremont Cable: packaging waste was reduced via the improved use and reuse of pallets and cardboard
packaging materials. In addition, the disposal of batteries was reduced by transitioning to lithium batteries.

e Lexington: the process for the reuse of acetone has been improved, reducing the volume sent for disposal.
e Wrexham (UK): improved reuse of pallets.

e Aberdare: upgrades to the machines in the compounds room reduced losses and therefore scrap. Additio-
nally, workers have been encouraged to reduce the number of machine start-ups.

e Livorno: the consumption of SF, gas has been reduced following periodic maintenance work on the
recycling plant.

e Morelena Energy and Telecom: the volume of compound scrap has been reduced thanks to a PVC “microni-
ser”, which reuse of the polymer possible in other production cycles.
