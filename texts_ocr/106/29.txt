A CLEAR AND AMBITIOUS ACTION PLAN

The Prysmian Group has implemented concrete actions designed to achieve the sustainability objectives identi-
fied in the scorecard. The main actions include:

11 seas MAKE CITIES AND HUMAN SETTLEMENTS INCLUSIVE, SAFE, RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE

Increase the percentage of cables covered by the carbon footprint calculation: to this end, aplatform
has been implemented that can calculate the carbon footprint of various types of cable (Common
Analysis).

 
 

te ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SUSTAINABLE AND MODERN ENERGY FOR ALL
“Develop innovative solutions that contribute actively to the transition towards the use of renewable
sources and the digitalisation of networks, such as cables for the production and distribution of solar
and wind energy, undersea cables for interconnections between countries and optical fibre cables.

 

ry TAKE URGENT ACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS, REGULATING EMISSIONS AND
PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
@ Increase the number of plants with environmental, health and safety management certification.
Investments and other initiatives designed to reduce GHG emissions.

ENSURE SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION PATTERNS
wl) Increase third-party audits in specific areas, such as governance, the environment and human
resources.

5 ee, ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY AND EMPOWER ALL WOMEN AND GIRLS
Increase the percentage of women in executive positions via the adoption of specific “diversity and
Sg inclusion” programmes, such as the “Side-by-Side” project for the promotion of diversity within the bu-
siness, and the mentoring of female talents, such as the WLP (Women Leadership Programme).

 

The long-term strategy translates into a search for stable equilibrium, balancing the adoption of innovative and
efficient processes [organisation], the responsible management of performance throughout the entire value
chain [operations], the safeguarding of personnel and the recognition of talent [people].

Sustainability therefore plays a central role for the Group, which is committed to promoting a business model
that integrates economic, social and environmental responsibility in all its aspects.

Our approach recognises the key importance of listening to and actively involving all internal and external sta-
keholders, dedicating constant attention to the evolution of the global and industry context, and acting re-
sponsibly towards the environment and society as a whole.

In this sense, the Prysmian Group recognises the responsibility deriving from our industry leadership role in
facilitating the energy and digital transition to a new development model focused on renewable energy and
decarbonisation.

As such, the objectives of the Prysmian Group include designing the advanced infrastructure for the transmis-
sion and distribution of energy and data needed for the development of economies, and well as for growth and
progress in developing countries.
