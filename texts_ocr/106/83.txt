LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS

Compliance risks concerning the Code of Ethics, Policies and Procedures

The risk of compliance generically represents the possibility of incurring legal or administrative sanctions, signi-
ficant financial losses or reputational damage as a result of breaches of current regulations. The Prysmian Group
puts in place a series of organisational tools aimed at defining the principles of legality, transparency, fairness
and loyalty used to operate. In particular, since its inception, the Group has adopted a Code of Ethics containing
guidelines and ethical and behavioural principles that all those carrying out activities on behalf of Prysmian
or its subsidiaries are required to observe (including managers, officials, employees, agents, representatives,
external collaborators, suppliers and consultants). Through the Internal Audit & Compliance Department, the
Group constantly monitors compliance and the concrete application of these rules, not tolerating any type of
violation.

By constant commitment, careful supervision and periodic awareness building, the Group seeks to minimise the
possibility of episodic improper conduct in violation of policies, procedures and the Code of Ethics and, therefo-
re, of current regulations, by those that carry out activities on behalf of Prysmian.

Risks of non-compliance with Data Protection legislation (Privacy)

Inthe current context, marked by the increasing globalisation of business, the proliferation of channels and methods
of access to information, as wellas an increase in the volume and types of data managed, Prysmian is tackling the dif-
ferent data management topics that range from alignment with the latest industry regulations, to defence against
potential threats against the confidentiality, completeness, accuracy and availability of information.

In this light, it is essential to adopt an overall vision for the management of sensitive information, not only in
terms of regulatory compliance - as described in the Group Annual Report, in the section on Risk Factors and
Uncertainties - but also with regard to security problems and our business priorities. Furthermore, the European
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) entered into force in May 2018 and has become one of the major
points of reference for a renewed effort in the area of data protection, with a focus on personal data.

The programme for the protection of personal data adopted by Prysmian is based on the following fundamental
elements that involve the entire business structure:

e implementation of a “data centric” model, by mapping the personal data processed by business functions
and keeping a register of processing activities;

e definition of a governance model designed to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and other emer-
ging data protection requirements, marked by:
— anorganisational structure that assigns an advisory and monitoring role to the data protection officer
(DPO) inthe management of personal data, delegating duties and the related responsibilities to the roles
that actually process that data;

— _ aseries of policies and documents that support the model (business policies, information sheets, inter-
nal appointments, clauses applicable to suppliers etc.);

e implementation of adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate
tothe risk, partly with the help of new tools suchas the data protection impact assessment introduced by the
GDPR;

e definition of the communications and training materials specifically reserved for the roles identified with
the data protection organisational model, so that all roles involved are aware of the renewed regulatory obli-
gations and take steps to implement all specified requirements;

e update of the video surveillance systems, with particular reference to the new European guidelines and the
regulations applicable in Italy.
