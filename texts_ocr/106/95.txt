94 | Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019

 

In addition, a new conflicts of interest policy was issued in 2019, consistent with the constant commitment of
the Group to ensuring that the financial and personal interests of employees and consultants do not conflict
with their ability to perform their duties with professionalism, ethics and transparency.

The new policy, approved by the Board of Directors on 12 November 2019”, requires all employees and consul-
tants to disclose all potential conflicts of interest, which will then be appropriately analysed and assessed in
order to agree any corrective actions needed to mitigate or eliminate the conflict.

Thenew policies (Code of Ethics, Global Compliance, Helpline, Anti-Corruption, Gifts & Entertainment, Third-Par-
ty Program, Antitrust, Antitrust EU, Conflicts of Interest, Export Control) have been published on the corporate
intranet and are available in the official languages of the Prysmian Group.

In December 2016, General Cable entered into a 3-year non-prosecution agreement (“NPA’) with the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice and, at the same time, sent a disclosure letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
for violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA’). As part of its commitment under the NPA, Ge-
neral Cable adopted new and modified existing internal controls, compliance policies and procedures in order
to ensure that it maintains (a) a system of internal accounting controls designed to ensure that the Company
makes and keeps fair and accurate books, records and accounts; and (b) a rigorous anti-corruption compliance
programme designed to detect and deter violations of applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA.

The NPA was due to expire on 31 December 2019, but has not yet terminated.

In the three-year period 2017-2019, there were no cases of corruption within the Prysmian Group.

ANTI-TRUST REGULATIONS

Competition law on restrictive practices and the abuse of dominant positions now plays a central role in gover-
ning the activities of firms operating in all sectors of economic life. Prysmian’s strong international presence in
more than 50 countries subjects the Group to the competition law in force in all countries in which we operate
globally. Prysmian, potentially exposed to the risk of being involved in conduct that could be considered anti-
competitive and could consequently result in extremely high economic sanctions with negative repercussions
on the reputation and credibility of the Group's governance system operates on the market in compliance with
the regulations competition protection.

Consistent with the priorities defined in the ERM process, the Board of Directors has adopted an Anti-trust Code
of Conduct that all directors, executives and employees of the Group are expected to know and comply with in
the performance of their duties and in relations with third parties.

As with the other policies, the Antitrust Code of Conduct was also updated following the acquisition of General
Cable, in order to have a document, valid for the entire Prysmian Group, that provides an overview of the pro-
blems associated with applying the antitrust regulations and the consequent principles of conduct to be fol-
lowed.

In addition, more detailed documents were also adopted covering the antitrust regulations in force within the
European Union and in North America.

In 2017, Prysmian introduced an anti-trust training programme - Integrity First - designed to increase awareness
among those who work in the name and on behalf of the Group, so that during their activities they comply with
the rules safeguarding competition. This programme continued throughout 2019 (refer to the “ANTI-CORRUP-
TION POLICY” section for the training courses provided). The Antitrust Code of Conduct, which is an integral part
of this training programme, seeks to describe the issues relating to the application of the competition policy
with regard to cartels and the abuse of dominant positions.

20 The Board is the body responsible for approving all anti-corruption policies and procedures, after having analysed and discussed them. The Board did not hold any
specific induction sessions on anti-corruption matters during 2019.
