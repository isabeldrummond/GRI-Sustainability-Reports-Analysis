BENDBRIGHT* 180pm - Revolutionary innovation for broadband

Prysmian has launched the first fibre in the world that can be
bent at will, with a diameter of 180 microns that allows cable
miniaturisation at a level never before achieved. Optical fibre
cables are a crucial part of the global transition to flexible and
reliable connectivity. Their large number of fibres and reduced
diameter makes installation quicker and cheaper. This innovation
confirms the commitment of Prysmian to support the evolution
of high density optical networks.

| Interconnection of the Cycladic islands

Prysmian is achieving anew first thanks to a new cable with synthetic sheathing that is about 30% lighter
than steel, thus paving the way to newscenarios in which installations at great depth, up to.3,000 metres,

will be possible.

The Group is using this new technology for the undersea electrical interconnection of the Cycladic Islands,
Evia, Andros and Tinos, involving the design, supply and installation of two high voltage AC cablestthat will

increase energy transmission between the islands, ensuring solidity, reliability andsustainability. |
