PERFORMANCE and TALENT MANAGEMENT - P3 and P4 PROGRAMS

Prysmian People Performance (P3

In order to achieve our business objectives and continue to improve our results, each employee must be put
ina position to make a daily contribution. This requires the allocation of clear objectives agreed with their own
manager and the provision of constant feedback about the work performed and results obtained. For this, the
performance of Group employees is monitored through the programme Known as “Prysmian People Performan-
ce (P3)". P3, supported by an online platform, has the following aims:

e align personal objectives with those of the Group, thereby motivating each employee to do their best and
generate value for the entire organisation, creating a single business identity;

e guide leadership behaviour;
e facilitate communication between managers and staff, so that the results achieved can be shared;

e train those deemed most deserving, based on objective appraisals.

P3 currently only involves white-collar employees, engaging about 7,0007° in total in 2019. About 88% of the
Group's white-collar workers (including the front line) were given periodic performance appraisals during 2019.

The leadership behaviours considered when evaluating Group personnel were revised during 2019. This process
of revision benefited from the contribution of all employees who were directly involved in defining the new va-
lues, and who highlighted the importance of certain behaviours that provide guidance for all. P3 is a key tool in
the culture to be promoted internally, and the new values identified via employee involvement have helped to
define a new leadership model that comprises 6 key principles:
