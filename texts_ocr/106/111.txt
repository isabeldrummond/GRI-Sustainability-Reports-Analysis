Asin prior years, the Prysmian Group Academy will consider to expand its Managerial and Professional portfolio,
but priority will be given to digital training in 2020, supported by the new workday platform that will be avai-
lable to all employees.

There will be an important improvement in 2020, with the “digitalisation” of non-desk workers and, therefore,
the ability to include them on the e-learning platform. This will be additional to the training that is already de-
livered locally.

Accordingly, the digital portfolio will be enriched by technical and managerial training that is available to all,
everywhere and at any time.

The cultural diversity element will also receive considerable attention. Beyond the various specific diversity ini-
tiatives, the objective is to guarantee the development of a company culture that builds value by drawing on
different approaches and ways of thinking and working, assuring inclusivity for all employees.

28 Training hours include the hours of mandatory training and the hours of OTJ training, when certified, with the exclusion of OAPIL (Oman Aluminium Processing
Industries LLC) and Associated Cables Pvt. Ltd.
