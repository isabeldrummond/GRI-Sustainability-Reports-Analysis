The work performed on alignment with the European regulations will be leveraged as much as possible in the
compliance work required by national regulations in the countries where the Group operates, considering also
that the “Ley General de Proteccidn de Datos” about to be applied in Brazil is founded on the same principles.

THE HELPLINE PROGRAMME: INTEGRITY FIRST IN THE PRYSMIAN GROUP

As part of its commitment to ethical and legal behaviour, Prysmian invites all the Group's stakeholders to report
any real or apparent violations of the law, the Code of Ethics, or of ethical standards, so that they can be exa-
mined and dealt with appropriately. In order to meet this requirement and create the necessary conditions of
confidentiality, security and ease of reporting, in 2017 Prysmian adopted a Whistleblowing Policy that allowed
everyone (employees or not) to report to the Group any improper behaviour and alleged unlawful activities
identified within the organisation. This process envisaged two channels for the anonymous collection of repor-
ts, comprising dedicated telephone lines and a web portal, which were both managed by independent opera-
tors and available in the 26 languages used by the Group. A management committee was also established to
evaluate reports, conduct specific investigations, if necessary, and adopt appropriate measures.

Again, as part of work to harmonise compliance policies following the acquisition of General Cable, such topics
as the reporting of alleged violations of the law, the Code of Ethics or Group policies and, more generally, the
reporting of unlawful conduct were revisited during 2019.

As a result, in order to facilitate communications between the Group and employees, and between the Group
and third parties, making them easier and more open, as well as to reduce the fear of reprisals, the above pro-
cess has been redesigned and rebranded: from Whistle-blowing to Helpline.

In this context, a new Helpline Policy has been issued and a unique, new platform for the management of re-
ports from around the world has been implemented. This platform, administered by independent operators, is
available in the 26 languages used by the Group. Three reporting channels are currently available (web, telepho-
ne and e-mail).

The new policy reiterates the importance of communications within the Group, guaranteed by the anonymity
available to the reporter, as well as the ban on reprisals against those who report violations.

Lastly, role of the management committee mentioned above has been retained (now the Helpline Committee)
to analyse and evaluate the reports received, carry out any specific investigations deemed necessary and adopt
the appropriate measures.
