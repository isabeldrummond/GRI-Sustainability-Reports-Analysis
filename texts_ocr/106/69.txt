Prysmian and the financial markets

SHARE OWNERSHIP

Prysmian Group has been a public company in all respects for many years: its free float is equal to
100% of capital, of which around 70% is held by institutional investors.

The listing of Prysmian’s ordinary shares, resulting from the sale of 46% of the shares held by the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., took place on 3 May 2007 at a price of Euro 15.0 per share, corresponding to a capitalisation of Euro
2.7 billion. Subsequent to the listing, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gradually reduced its interest in the com-
pany, control of which it had acquired in July 2005, by placing the remaining 54% of the shares with institu-
tional and selected investors in several successive stages: i) approx. 22% in November 2007 ii) approx. 14% in
November 2009, iii) approx. 17% in March 2010. Valerio Battista, Prysmian’s Chief Executive Officer, announced
on occasion of the last sale that he had purchased 1,500,000 shares, corresponding to around 0.8% of share
capital and taking his total shareholding to 1.2%, which he has raised to approximately 1.5% during the course
of subsequent years.

At 31 December 2019, the Company's free float was equal to 100% of the outstanding shares and significant
shareholdings (in excess of 3%) accounted for approximately 23% of total share capital, meaning there were no
majority or controlling interests. Prysmian is now one of Italy’s few globally present industrial concerns to have
achieved true Public Company status in recent years.

As at 31 December 2019, the share capital of Prysmian S.p.A. amounted to Euro 26,814,424.60, comprising
268,144,246 ordinary shares with a nominal value of Euro 0.1 each. The ownership structure at that date is indi-
cated below.
