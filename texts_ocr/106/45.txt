e together with Rice University, the Company is striving to create an inter-sector consortium called Car-

bonHub and a think tank for obtaining clean energy from the hydrogen and advanced carbon mate-
rials that are co-produced efficiently and sustainably from natural gas and petroleum;

e together with the Fraunhofer Institute, we have developed optical fibre sensors based on Fibre Bragg

Gratings;

e together with Universita di Padova, we have perfected new materials that can be extruded for the

insulation of fire-resistant cables, as a replacement for mica tapes;

e together with Politecnico di Milano and the University of Lille, we have developed a coating for opti-

cal fibres using bio-derived raw materials;

e together within the University of Strasbourg, we have obtained a good understanding of the mecha-

ine of LSOH compounds;

 

 

 

nism for the decomposition of polymers during fires, which will provide a basis for developing anew

e together with Universita di Palermo, we are working on the advanced characterisation and testing of

high voltage cables and materials.
