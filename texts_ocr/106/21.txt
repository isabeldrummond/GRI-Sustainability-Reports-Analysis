THE LARGEST CABLE-LAYING VESSEL IN THE WORLD

The Leonardo da Vinci cable-laying vessel is now under construction. Named after the celebrate genius, inven-
tor and engineer, this ship will strengthen the ability of Prysmian to execute projects and our reputation as a
“one-stop-shop” service provider. The Leonardo da Vinci, which joins the current Prysmian fleet of three vessels,
will be the best performing cable-laying vessel in the world.

With a length of about 170 m and a beam of about 34 m, the Leonardo da Vinci is designed to guarantee grea-
ter capacity and versatility in the execution of projects, due to such advanced functionality as: ability to install
at depths of more than 3,000 m, due in part to a new generation of cable technology with lighter shielding;
maximum speed in excess of 14 Knots; 2 carousels of 7,000 and 10,000 tonnes, representing the greatest capa-
city available on the market and reducing the plant-site transportation time and, therefore, improving overall
project efficiency; 2 independent laying lines to increase operational flexibility; pulling force in excess of 180
tonnes that enables complex installation operations to be carried out, supporting a series of burial systems and
equipment, such as the submarine plough and the Hydroplow. The ship will be equipped with leading DP3 sy-
stems for reaching and holding position at sea, while its engines and propulsion systems have been designed
specifically to ensure their reduced environmental impact. All equipment for the handling and installation of
cables was designed by Prysmian.
