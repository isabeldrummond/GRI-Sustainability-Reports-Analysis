Responsibility towards people

Over more than 140 years, the Group has built its history and successes on the abilities of its employees. Indi-
viduals who have been leading actors in the achievement of these results, thanks to their ability to transmit
to younger colleagues, generation after generation, their values, experience and attachment to the firm. The
“human capital strategy”, launched in 2015 in support of our business strategy, and the growth of the company
towards 2020 regarding our sustainability objectives, will guide the development of specific initiatives in this
area, based on the following pillars:

e constant improvement and development of the organisational model, consistent with our business stra-
tegies and priorities;

e strategic planning of resources in order to ensure, over the medium term, the compatibility of our human
capital with the needs of the company in terms of capacity and skills;

e development of employer branding: increase Knowledge and awareness of the Prysmian brand as an em-
ployer and develop the positioning of the brand in the international job market, partly via strategic recruit-
ment initiatives;

e creation of astrong talent pipeline that ensures the sustainability of the Group's human resources strategy;

e development of technical, professional and managerial skills via the training initiatives of the Prysmian Aca-
demy, which has now been active for eight years;

e meritocracy as a basic element for the development of resources to ensure long-term sustainability;

e development of employee engagement and sense of belonging viaa structured approach to measuring the
corporate climate, in order to align management and the initiatives with the perceived priorities of employe-
es and, in particular, via a broad share ownership programme designed to make most of them shareholders.

The merger with General Cable in June 2018 had a major impact on the human resources of the Group and on
the activities of the function dedicated to their management. Consistent with the work carried out in 2018 to
launch the new values, a new leadership model was designed and defined in 2019 to provide a basis for the new
assessment system for both performance and potential. Training in this regard was provided to 2,500 managers
around the world.

In terms of engagement, a decision was made in 2019 to revise the survey and extend it to all employees, in-
cluding blue-collar workers. The objective is to monitor effectively the corporate climate and the post-merger
consolidation.

As apriority in the next few years, the Group will define action plans and implement measures, as necessary, to
improve the life quality and satisfaction of employees.

In January 2020, the spread in China of COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, had a significant impact on
production and trade. The effects of COVID-19, which until early March had mostly been felt in China, with
early signs in Italy, then rapidly expanded to the global level, leading the World Health Organization (WHO)
to designate Covid-19 a pandemic.

To respond to the spread of COVID-19 and protect its people, the Group has taken mitigation measures safe-
guarding its employees, relating to implementation of strict health and safety measures at plants and offi-
ces and extensive use of remote working.
