STRATEGIC RISKS

Risks related to changes in the legislative environment governing Health, Safety and the
Environment

The Group's production activities are subject to national and international laws and regulations governing Heal-
th, Safety and the Environment.

Via the HSE Management System, centralised and coordinated by the Corporate HSE team, the Group is able to
monitor constantly any changes and/or developments in the HSE requirements, including:

e periodic monitoring of environmental and energy legislation and related changes, at local and Group level;
e periodic monitoring of health and safety legislation and related changes, at local and Group level;

e periodic reporting to the Group bodies involved in the management of risks, in order to discuss any actions
that must be taken for compliance with the law (the Sustainability Directive Committee and the Internal Risk
Management Committee);

e theanalysis of identified risk situations, with the aim of estimating their impact, the probability of occurren-
ce and the adequacy of the internal control system to mitigate the risk;

e the definition of improvement actions that may be necessary to reduce exposure to current risk, and related
follow up;

e the evaluation of environmental, health and safety or energy performance, downstream of the introduced
improvement actions.

OPERATIONAL RISKS
Health and safety risks

With particular reference to health and safety risks, the Group has adopted a centralised management system
based on the identification and evaluation of factors deemed critical at various levels, with respect to the Group,
country and operating unit.

This approach allows for a complete picture of the risks associated with individual production activities, both at
Group level and in each country and operating unit, in order to manage, monitor and, where possible, minimise
the health and safety risks. The adoption and application of the approach at production unit level involves iden-
tifying all health and safety risks, their assessment in accordance with a specific procedure and in compliance
with local legislation, guaranteeing the level of safety established by Prysmian, and their periodic update.

In order to apply the standards defined at Group level, Prysmian uses tools and operating procedures for the
collection, evaluation, aggregation and reporting of data at central level, as well as the implementation
and verification of corrective and preventive actions; the monitoring of significant events (injuries, near
misses, non-conformities and reporting); and training not only for the transfer of technical knowledge, but
also to impart understanding of the approach taken and the risks incurred by non-compliance with the H&S
rules and procedures.

Lastly, 71% of plants within the Prysmian Group perimeter (including those acquired together with General
Cable) have OHSAS 18001 / ISO 45001 (safety management) certification.
