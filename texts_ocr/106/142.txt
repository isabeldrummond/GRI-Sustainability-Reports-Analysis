Sustainable supply chain

The Group constantly strengthens relations with strategic suppliers, seeking to build together a common orga-
nisational process focused on sustainability throughout the entire production chain.

The main Group suppliers provide the principal raw materials used by Prysmian in the production processes: cop-
per, aluminium, lead, various petroleum derivatives (such as PVC and polyethylene) and components for Power
and Telecom cable accessories, as well as special types of glass and sheathing for optical fibre.

During 2019, the Prysmian Group successfully managed to include the entire General Cable perimeter in the
quantitative reporting of ESG factors. This milestone has made it possible to guarantee that the five priorities
underlying management of the supply chain are implemented and monitored by the Group as a whole. These
priorities include environmental and social objectives:

e only use qualified suppliers;

e only use materials whose technical characteristics have been authorised;

e develop strategies for commodities that guarantee continuity of supply and availability of the required volu-
me. In particular, the financial health of the supplier is important, as is only modest dependency on specific
suppliers by Prysmian;

e guarantee on-time delivery and a high level of quality over time;

e ensure competitive prices.

Additionally, the strategic management of the Prysmian Group supply chain is based on a defined process that
takes ESG factors in account:

e riskassessment;
e identification of critical suppliers;
e supplier management and performance evaluation;

e search and selection of the supplier according to standardised processes.

Inrelation to these, Prysmian identified and developed 3 main macro-activities for the enhancement of sustai-
nability aspects:

1. subscription to ethical standards in the introduction of new suppliers: Code of Ethics and Code of Business
Conduct, definition of Conflict Minerals Policy and Human Rights Policy. These documents also apply to the
new perimeter;

2. sustainability assessment of the current supply chain: Sustainability Desk Analysis, Risk Analysis and self-as-
sessment questionnaires on sustainability issues;

3. management and improvement of sustainability aspects: implementation of actions with a view to achie-
ving the objectives included in the Sustainability Scorecard.

As announced last year with regard to the Assessment, Management and Improvement of sustainability mat-
ters within the Group supply chain, during 2019 Prysmian included the suppliers within the General Cable peri-
meter in the new Sustainability Desk Analysis and Risk analysis, thus ensuring complete and effective analysis of
the areas/suppliers with potential ESG risks.
