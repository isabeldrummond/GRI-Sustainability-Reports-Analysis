Group risk management system

INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF SUSTAINABILITY RISKS

The Prysmian Group adopts a system of internal control and risk management based on tools and information
flows that enable the Board of Directors to take strategic decisions and establish guidelines for the system in an
informed manner, considering the context in which the Group operates and the related financial, environmen-
tal and social risks.

From 2012, by adopting the provisions introduced by the “Code of Corporate Governance for companies listed
on the Italian Stock Exchange” in the field of risk management, Prysmian can make use of an “Enterprise Risk
Management” (ERM) model, which allows the Board to make an aware assessment of the risk scenarios that
could compromise the achievement of strategic objectives and adopt additional tools to anticipate, mitigate
and manage significant exposures.

The ERM model adopted, formalised in the Group ERM Policy that incorporates the guidelines for the System
of Internal Control and Risk Management approved, in turn, by the Board of Directors back in 2014, follows a
top-down approach, i.e. based on direction from senior management and the medium/long-term strategies
and objectives of the business. This extends to all types of risk/opportunity that are potentially significant for
the Group. These are shown in five families that each include internal and external issues characteristic of Pry-
smian’s business model (so-called Group Risk Model): Strategic Risks, Financial Risks, Operational Risks, Legal
and Compliance Risks, and Planning and Reporting Risks.

The Group's Chief Risk Officer (CRO), appointed to govern the ERM process, is responsible for ensuring together
with management that the main risks faced by Prysmian and its subsidiaries are identified, assessed and mo-
nitored on a timely basis. In addition, an Internal Risk Management Committee comprising senior managers
ensures, via the CRO, that the ERM process remains dynamic to reflect changes in the business, requirements
and events affecting the Group over time. The CRO reports periodically (at least twice each year) to senior ma-
nagement on these changes.

In compliance with the changes to the Code of Corporate Governance published in the July 2015 edition and in
line with the constant strengthening of its risk management system, the Group has decided to adopt a broader
approach to Corporate Social Responsibility”, planning to define each area of the Group risk model ina so-cal-
led Sustainability Risk Model that can guide more precise identification of the economic, environmental and
social sustainability risks faced by the Group that could compromise value creation for shareholders/stakehol-
ders over time.
