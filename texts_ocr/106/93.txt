Ethics and Integrity

CODE OF ETHICS OF THE PRYSMIAN GROUP

“The Code of Ethics represents the Group's «Constitution», being the charter of rights and moral
duties that define the ethical-social responsibilities of each participant in the organisation”.

The Code of Ethics establishes the principles for all to follow, consistent with the vision and mission of the Group.
Acting as a veritable guide to daily behaviour, the Code of Ethics plays a strategic role for the Group as a tool for
preventing irresponsible or illegal conduct by those who work in the name and on behalf of Prysmian. The Code
of Ethics lives and evolves with the development of the business in the competitive world and is always open to
receive and accept requests for legality and propriety expressed by any of Prysmian stakeholders. The Code of
Ethics complies with international best practices and adopts the principles embodied in the UN Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights and the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The
structure of the Prysmian Group's Code of Ethics, in its latest version of 1 August 2019, is founded on three pillars:

e Ethics in business activities
e Ethics in internal relations
e Ethics in environmental and social matters

We recommend referring to the Prysmian Group website for further insights to these three pillars. All companies
within the Group strictly comply with the Code of Ethics, applicable regulations and the rules and procedures adop-
ted from time to time by the Group. In order to ensure the widest possible distribution of its contents, the Code of
Ethics is available in 26 languages and is also published on the Company's website, www.prysmiangroup.com.

The Code reflects a common and shared approach to business, honest, ethical and compliant with all current
laws and regulations, which must be respected by all Group employees wherever they work and live around the
world. Itis fundamental, in fact, for all employees to take responsibility for their daily work and accept personal-
ly, with conviction, the spirit of the Code.

ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY

Prysmian Group has implemented a series of actions aimed at managing corruption issues on a preventive basis;
the first of these is the adoption of an Anti-Corruption Policy that prohibits the corruption of both public offi-
cials and private individuals and requires Prysmian’s employees to abide by it and to observe and comply with
all anti-corruption legislation in force in the countries in where they are employed or active, if these are more
restrictive.
