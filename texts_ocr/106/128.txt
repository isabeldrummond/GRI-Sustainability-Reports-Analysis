ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

In terms of environmental impacts, the Group reports in this document those that are most significant in ter-
ms of responsibility towards employees, local communities and as a competitiveness and value factor for the
Group. These aspects are:

e energy consumption, obtained as the sum of all energy sources used in manufacturing and service activities;

e water consumption, which is significant due to the large volumes needed for cooling in the various pro-
duction cycles;

e hazardous and non-hazardous waste, with a potential impact on various environmental factors and very con-
siderable importance in the assessment of process efficiency;

e recycled waste - hazardous and non-hazardous (part of those referred to in the previous point);

e greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), primarily linked to the use of sources of energy and, to a very limited ex-
tent, to the use of greenhouse gases at certain stages of production;

Based on assessments and past experience, the Group does not report on the following aspects, which are con-
sidered to be less significant:

e waste water originating from cooling systems, if not contained within a closed-circuit system and if not re-
quiring special treatment;

e atmospheric emissions generated by production processes, which are not especially significant in most cases.

Further details on performance indicators, perimeter and reporting methods are available in the “Notes on the
data and information”.

In the three-year period 2017-2019, the Group did not receive significant sanctions (monetary“° or other) in ca-
ses of regulatory non-compliance in the environmental field.

The matters identified during periodic internal checks or visits from external bodies or customers are managed
directly by the sites concerned, which determine the actions to be implemented and the related timing. Should
it not be possible to meet the deadline for the restoration of conformity, the management of the sites concer-
ned arrange, with support from the country HSE function, to contact the supervisory bodies, confirming the
willingness of Prysmian to implement the necessary measures and justifying the request to extend the deadline
dates established by them.

As in the prior year, environmental data was estimated for those plants (2 in 2019, +2%) that do not have
reliable information.

40 For monetary sanctions, significant means amounts above Euro 10,000.
