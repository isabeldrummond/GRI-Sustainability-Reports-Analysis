Signature of the Green Deal by the new European
Commission in December 2019 has, for the first time,
committed the EU to strive for climate neutrality by
2050, confirming compliance with the intermediate
objectives set for 2030 and 2040.

This has activated an ambitious action plan to limit
the increase in global warming over the next thirty
years that, according to the estimates of the UN In-
tergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCQ),
must not exceed 1.5°C in order to avoid irreparable
damage to the planet. A similar approach was con-
firmed by the United Nations at the start of 2020,
which launched the “Decade of Action” programme
containing accelerated solutions for all the challen-
ges set by the 2030 sustainable development goals.

 

So there is no doubt that the single most important goal is to achieve the production of clean electri-
city. This means transitioning from the current model based on the combustion of fossil fuels and
main culprit of climate change - and, therefore, for about 60% of global greenhouse gas emissions
- to the production of energy from renewable sources that preserve eco-systems for future genera-
tions and can be made accessible to an increasing number of persons in all regions of the world, in
order to support their civil and economic progress.

The Prysmian Group is committed to supporting efforts to achieve the objectives set by the global
agenda, contributing to the creation and modernisation of infrastructure for the transportation and
distribution of energy and telecommunications, which are essential drivers in the transition to the
new model for the development of society.

For this reason, the Group is committed to constant technological innovation, with about Euro 106 mil-
lion invested in R&D during 2019, over 50 partnerships for innovation and about 5,900 patents held.

As a public company, we have always maintained open and transparent dialogue with our stakehol-
ders: shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers, the institutions and the communities in
which we work. We are committed to ensuring high governance standards and practices: 67% of
Board members are independent, 42% are women. Over 9,200 Group employees are shareholders in
the Company, owning about 1.5% of share capital.
