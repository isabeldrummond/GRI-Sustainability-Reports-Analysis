Customer portals

The main objective of the customer portals made available in each country, consistent with the customer cen-
tricity strategy developed in all regions, is to enhance customer satisfaction and automate customer service.

The development of customer portals at country level adds value in various ways:

e reduced need to contact the Prysmian back office by telephone;

access to a digital infopoint;

e 24/7 access to the information needed;
e optimised procurement cycle;

e order tracking;

e access to information about product availability.

MANAGEMENT OF COMPLAINTS

A fundamental element in the customer centricity strategy is the attention paid to product quality and avai-
lability. For this reason, it is very important for the Group to manage complaints received from customers in
a proper manner.

A complaint is defined as all written notification from a customer about a potential product non-conformity
that is recognised as such by Prysmian. A product non-conformity represents all deviations from standards,
specifications, procedures or regulations that may have a direct or indirect impact on product quality.

Product complaints are managed using the 8D problem analysis method. Complaints received are sent to the
competent office (quality or logistics), which investigates the non-conformity identified. After the presen-
ce of anon-conformity has been confirmed or denied, the sales office takes responsibility for managing the
complaint.

The Group recorded 8% fewer complaints in 2019 than in 2018; in particular, 2,927 complaints were received,
compared with 3,187 in 2018**. This reduction is all the more significant because the reporting system is more
robust than it was in the prior year, with SAP coverage rising to 67%. The other 33% of plants continue to re-
port their data on Excel sheets.

43 he 2018 Non-Financial Declaration stated that the Group had received 1,864 complaints from customers in that year. As an improvement, the revised 2018 data
presented above includes the former General Cable perimeter.
