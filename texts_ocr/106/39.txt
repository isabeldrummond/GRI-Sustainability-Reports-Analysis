2. Assessment of topics

The topics were assessed by both external stakeholders and top management, identifying an order of priority
(from 1 to 5) for them within the materiality matrix. The topics were assessed in 2019 during stakeholder enga-
gement activities (event and survey) and internal meetings (Sustainability Steering Committee and survey of
top management). The assessment was carried out in the manner recommended in the GRI standards, which
call on organisations to focus attention on topics that are important for their business activities and their sta-
keholders. As aresult of this assessment it was possible to update the materiality matrix, providing an aggrega-
ted view of the importance of issues both for the Group and its stakeholders, in terms of the actual and potential
impact of each on the Group's ability to create value in the long run.

Downstream of this process, the issues have been grouped into a special reconciliation table” under the areas
identified in the Decree (environmental, human rights, social, anti-corruption, employees and transversal). in
order to align reporting with the express requirements of the Decree.
