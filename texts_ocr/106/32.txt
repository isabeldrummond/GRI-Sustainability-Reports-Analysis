I Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 31

 

he Group completed the priority definition process in 2016. Analysis considered the main global and industry
rends, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 (SDGs) defined by the United Nations, requests from
major International Sustainability Indexes (Dow Jones Sustainability Index, FTSE4GOOD, CDP, Bloomberg ESG,
etc.) and the needs and expectations of the Group's stakeholders, which are mapped each year through sta-
eholder engagement initiatives undertaken by the Group.

The analysis was then supplemented by strategic guidance from the Compensation, Appointments and Sustai-
ability Committee of the Board of Directors, establishing the strategic priorities and, therefore, the related
PIs, targets and actions needed to achieve them.

Sa

The SDGs played a key role in defining the objectives of the Group, enabling the Prysmian Group to supplement
ts own priorities with those identified by the UN and compare its strategic sustainability goals with those adop-
ed at a global level.

he Prysmian Group has identified 13 SDGs with a direct business impact, 5 of which are considered to be the most
mportant: Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), Affor-
dable and clean energy (SDG 7), Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and Gender equality (SDG 5).

 

 

These are supplemented by the suggestions that emerge from annual meetings with Stakeholders and the re-
quirements of the main Sustainability Indexes.
