INNOVATION CONTEST: 500 ideas from all over the world

Supported by Corporate Hanger, Prysmian Group launched the first global innovation contest in spring
2019. Prysmian Group sales and R&D teams were eligible to participate in the innovation contest. Re-
gardless of their roles in the corporate hierarchy, employees were invited to submit innovative ideas
and solutions, relying on their profound knowledge of customer requirements and the Group's pro-
duction processes.

By involving the global community, the purpose of the contest was to gather, select and develop inno-
vative ideas that could strengthen the activities of the Group.

The contest was structured into 4 categories, each assigned to an internal Innovation Champion:
Smart Solutions, Servitization, Sustainability and Out of the Box. The Innovation Contest was a great
success, with almost 500 ideas submitted from all geographical areas.

NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCTION (NPI)

The introduction of new products is tracked using an NPI vitality tool that measures the revenues generated
from new products introduced in the last 3 years as a proportion of total revenues from all Group products. The
main purpose of this tool is to increase awareness of the growing importance of innovation as a success factor
and of the development of new products as a driver for improving the performance of the organisation. The
merger with General Cable in 2018 consolidated our ability to create innovation in support of the R&D area and
to develop new solutions that satisfy the greatest expectations of our customers, creating value for the Group.

The overall results of the Group were analysed in 2019 (without distinguishing between Prysmian and General
Cable), identifying that the integration with General Cable has enhanced the focus on efficiency and technologi-
cal innovation, with a strong contribution from the 866 new product families active in the third quarter of 2019,
of which 51 were designed by General Cable North America.

The Group's new products generated Euro 800 million through Q3 2019, compared to Euro 496 million through
Q3 2018. The NPI vitality increased from 10.1% in Q3 2018 to 12.3% in Q3 2019 — led by North America and the
Telecom area.

The merger of PG and GCC has created a world leader in the supply of cables and systems for energy and telecom-
munications, with the following statistics:
