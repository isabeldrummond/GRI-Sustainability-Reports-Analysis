124 | Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019

 

The Prysmian Group has continued to manage various activities including active participation in various wor-
king parties and on association committees, such as Europacable’s ECOE Committee and its “Carbon Task For-
ce”, Orgalime’s “Substances Task Force”, ANIE’s Environment Committee and AICE’s environment working party,
and the IEC Maintenance Team that is drafting the standard environmental declaration for power cables. The
approach to integration adopted represents an opportunity to improve and, in this light, operational policies
and practices for the management of the environment, health and safety by all operating units will be further
developed and agreed.

In this context, consideration will be given to strengthening further the standardisation and coordination acti-
vities carried out by the central HSE functions, while local work will continue on “multi-site” development at
national or legal entity level.

In 2019, the Mudanya plant (Turkey) collaborated with JAC (Joint Audit Cooperation)*? , which had recognised
the Slatina plant (Romania) in 2018 for its high sustainability performance, by selecting from its supply chain an
organisation to be rated by JAC, in order to encourage other businesses in the ICT (Information Communication
Technology) sector to make Corporate Social Responsibility commitments. Following the audit, carried out in
September 2019 by an external agency in the presence of personnel from Prysmian Mudanya, any necessary
corrective actions will be completed prior to final validation by JAC.

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

Work in 2019 was dedicated to updating the Safety Management Systems, in order to maintain the certifications
of all organisations in accordance with the latest version of the standard: ISO 45001:2018. The transition to this
standard is still in progress and follows the timetable for the certification audits of the various plants and other
organisations, bearing in mind the deadline of 12 March 2020, after which it will no longer to be possible to carry
out audits pursuant to OHSAS 18001.

Atthe same time, in order to facilitate local implementation of the requirements of the new standard, the rela-
ted Group procedures for the functioning of Environment Management Systems have been revised. This is be-
cause they provide a fundamental point of reference that local organisations must implement and integrate
into their own systems, while taking account of their own specific needs. In particular, these Group procedures
supplement the requirements of standard ISO 14001:2015 with those of ISO 45001:2018; accordingly, the above
revision took account of the interactions between the two standards, in order to obtain maximum benefit from
the synergies deriving from their common requirements. The revision also improved the usability of the Group
procedures as guidelines for the local implementation and maintenance of systems, with particular reference
to the tools for managing and reporting the non-conformities and consequent actions identified by audits (in-
ternal and external), or evenjust matters and problems noted by safety management personnel, workers at any
level or third parties.

Six new certifications in accordance with relevant international standards were obtained during 2019. In particular:
e 4, in accordance with OHSAS 18001 / ISO 45001;
e 2, in accordance with ISO 14001.

About 83% of Prysmian plants, including those deriving from the acquisition of General Cable, hold ISO 14001
certification, while 71% are OHSAS 18001 / ISO 45001 certified.

The above percentages only refer to production sites; however, in addition to these, other types of organisation
within the Group are also certified, such as R&D, installation activities, kitting and distribution centres etc.

39 JACis an international association composed of leading telecom operators that assesses and promotes the implementation of CSR best practices at the production
centres of firms operating in the sector. The audit and assessment process is carried out by site visits and by interviewing the executives and workers at the plants
concerned, in order to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the CSR policies adopted by the organisations and assign an overall score, as well as detailed scores in
each area. The firms audited are invited to complete the corrective actions identified within a specified period.
