@ P-LASER SOLUTION. the first technology for fully-recyclable cables with top performance in
terms of power and cost reduction

P-Laser power transmission and distribution cables provide an innovative solution that is
more reliable and ecological. These cable systems are designed to provide optimal technical
solutions for high power transmissions over long distances with minimal ground occupancy.
P-Laser is the first technology for ecological, fully-recyclable high performance cables that use
a “zero gas” process to reduce CO, emissions up to 30%.

This innovation also has strategic importance in the field of HVDC (high voltage direct current)
cables, allowing the maximum level of transmissible power to reach 3.5 GW per dipole, with
cost reductions up to 30% per MW transmitted. P-Laser cable is based on the use of a thermo-
plastic material patented by the Group, with a simplified production process and lower envi-
ronmental impact than traditional cables insulated with cross-linked polyethylene. The cables
can be produced continuously by a single process and no chemical reactions are required to
obtain the highly stable electrical properties needed for HVDC systems, thus shortened pro-
duction times and, consequently, the consumption of energy and related gas emissions. The
application of P-Laser technology to underground and subsea HVDC cable systems is a first in
the cables industry.

@ High depth submarine cables with synthetic armor

Submarine cables are now one of the most important factors for the energy transition. The pro-
duction of electricity from renewable sources and the interconnection of grids are two main
areas of massive development for subsea energy connections. Prysmian is achieving a new re-
cord in this field, with anew cable reinforced by synthetic armor that is about 30% lighter than
the equivalent steel solution. The Group is using this new technology for the Cycladic Islands
project, which involves the design, supply and installation of two HVAC cables, as well as the re-
lated land-based civil works. The system will increase energy transmission between the Cycla-
dic Islands, ensuring solidity, reliability and sustainability.

@ BendBright*s 180pm - the first bend insensitive fibre in the world

Prysmian has introduced a revolutionary innovation for the development of broadband tele-
communications: the first bend insensitive fibre in the world, with a diameter of 180 microns
that allows cable miniaturisation at a level never achieved before. Optical fibre cables bend in-
sensitive are, in fact, a crucial part of the global transition to flexible and reliable connectivity.
The large number of fibres and reduced diameter make installation quicker and cheaper. This
innovation confirms the commitment of Prysmian to support the evolution of high density op-
tical networks.
