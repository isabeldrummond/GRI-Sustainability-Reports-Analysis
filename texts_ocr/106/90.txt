Governance and sustainability

In accordance with the principles of the Code of Corporate Governance for Listed Companies and the recom-
mendations of Consob, as well as to align with international best practices, the Board of Directors (Board) of
the Group, from 1 January 2016, tasked the Compensation, Appointments and Sustainability Committee with
overseeing the sustainability issues of the Group's operating practices and the dynamics of its interaction with
all stakeholders.

The Committee, which meets at least once a year to address sustainability issues, is responsible for:

e monitoring the company’s positioning on the main sustainability indices;

e providing advice on the main sustainability initiatives developed by the Group;

e approving, prior to the Board meeting, the Disclosure of Non-Financial Information (DNF)/Group Annual Su-

stainability Report.

To underline Prysmian’s commitment and attention to sustainability issues along the entire value chain and wi-
thin all company processes, a Sustainability Steering Committee has been formed in 2016 as part of the internal
governance system. Consisting of the top echelons of the organisation and chaired by the Chief Operating Offi-
cer (COO), the Committee is responsible for:

e promoting a culture of sustainability within all company activities;

e defining and/or evaluating the implementation of projects or programs aimed at improving the sustainabi-
lity agenda;

e monitoring the objectives of the Group Sustainability Policy, progress with respect to the “Sustainability Sco-
recard” and the progress of the actions to ensure compliance with the Group's policies, and developing an
ever growing internal responsibility towards results in areas of sustainability;

e supervising all ongoing initiatives that have an impact, current and potential, on the performance of econo-
mic, social and environmental sustainability;

e ensuring the effective communication of our commitment and results achieved in the field of sustainability;
e supporting initiatives to protect diversity and inclusion both internally and externally.

Within its mission, the Sustainability Steering Committee meets periodically to discuss strategic sustainability
priorities, the progress of the action plan and its implementation. The strategic lines of sustainability are defi-
ned and promoted at the corporate level, and then integrated into local policies and all daily activities.

The Corporate and Business Communications department is responsible for coordinating all activities related to
the Group's sustainability reporting, both in terms of process and of content, mapping the Group's stakeholders
and monitoring their expectations through stakeholder engagement activities, as well as guaranteeing tran-
sparent and constant communication both with the external and the internal stakeholders.

The strategic lines of sustainability are defined and promoted at the corporate level, and then integrated into
local policies and all daily activities.
