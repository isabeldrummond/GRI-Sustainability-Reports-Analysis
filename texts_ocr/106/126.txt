With a view to further increasing the percentage of certified sites, a four-year programme of “new” certifica-
tions has been established that involve many General Cable production units. The first objective will be to assess
their health, safety and environmental risks, in line with the systematic approach adopted by the Group.

The HSE function held a Worldwide Meeting in March 2019, which was attended for the first time by the HSE
Region/Country managers of General Cable, as well as bya number of Plant Managers. The objective was to com-
municate the HSE and REAL ESTATE objectives, facilitate collaboration among the various business functions in
the implementation of current projects and the definition of improvement actions, thus creating conditions for
the increasingly integrated and sustainable development of HSE initiatives and commitments.

The commitment of Prysmian and the improvement initiatives launched over the years, with a view to using
resources more efficiently and reducing the environmental impact of production processes and products, have
already resulted in environmental benefits and cost reductions and, accordingly, the Group will continue efforts
to improve continuously its HSE performance.

In particular, the HSE function, with the cooperation of other central functions and the operating units, will ende-
avour to ensure:

e increasingly precise and reliable Group-level reporting of data and information on consumption and gre-
enhouse gas emissions, completing integration of the GC units within the perimeter;

e the growing involvement of Group suppliers in monitoring and quantifying the impacts of climate change
associated with the Prysmian supply chain;

e increasingly detailed quantification of the environmental impact of our products throughout their entire life
cycle, paying particular attention to the impact of the materials and services acquired;

 

e the precise collection of data and information about the consumption of specific cable production processes;

e the systematic application of methodologies for calculating the footprint of products (e.g. EPD or carbon
footprint/ISO 14067);

e the monitoring of improvement objectives for the future and their eventual updating, with the involvement
of all levels of the organisation in the planning of the initiatives and activities necessary for the achievement
of the stated commitments;

e ongoing implementation of energy efficiency initiatives in compliance with regulations (e.g. Directive
2012/27/EU on Energy Efficiency), the specific campaigns promoted nationally and, more generally, the
commitments undertaken at the Paris COP 21 Conference on Climate Change;

e theselection and coordination of specific projects to be implemented in the Group's operating units, with
their efforts carefully calibrated towards local operating requirements.

EMISSIONS SCOPE 3

In addition to the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, Prysmian also screens the Scope 3 “other indirect emissions”
(generated by other organisations as a consequence of Group activities), selecting the categories considered
significant for the Group, such as emissions related to Purchased goods and services, Waste generated in opera-
tions, Business travel, Employee commuting, Downstream transportation and distribution, and partially quan-
tifying them using “Quantis - Scope 3 Evaluator”, a GHG Protocol tool.

Albeit based on assumptions and estimates, this screening showed clearly the significant impact associated
with the “Purchased goods and services” category; accordingly, the Group decided to join the CDP Supply Chain
Programme, in order to involve the supply chain directly in the reporting and allocation to Prysmian of its emis-
sions, in collaboration with the CDP.

Significant suppliers, identified using sustainability criteria defined by the Prysmian Group, were invited to an-
swer the CDP 2019 Supply Chain Questionnaire.
