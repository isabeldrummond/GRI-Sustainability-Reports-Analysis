Risks related to the social sustainability of the organisational structure and business model

The Prysmian Group faces daily complexities deriving from the management of organisational and business
activities carried out by persons with different social and cultural backgrounds. Despite constant commitment,
careful supervision and periodic awareness building, with the provision of specific information and training ses-
sions, it is not possible to exclude episodic improper conduct in violation of policies, procedures and the Code
of Ethics and, therefore, of current regulations concerning human rights by those that carry out activities on
behalf of Prysmian, with consequent possible penalties, significant reputational damage and business impacts.

In order to mitigate this risk, the due diligence on human rights in the operations of the Group was updated
during 2019 and extended to include the former General Cable perimeter. The analysis sought to identify the
potential and actual impacts on human rights deriving from all Group activities and business relations.

In accordance with the so-called Ruggie Framework, the due diligence process comprises the following stages:

assessment of current and potential impact on human rights;

e assessment of the results and definition of the necessary actions to prevent and/or mitigate the potential
impact identified;

e monitoring of performance;
e resolution of breaches;
e communication of performance.

The Group has also launched an analysis aimed at assessing potential gaps with respect to international human
rights principles, Group Human Rights Policy and national legislation in each country in which the Group ope-
rates. The ultimate objective of the analysis is to identify the countries most exposed to the risk of violation of
human rights.
