ECONOMIC VALUE GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED

The Prysmian Group makes a constant effort to create and distribute value to its stakeholders. This commit-
ment is monitored every year thanks to the definition of the economic value generated and redistributed (or
Economic Value) that allows us to quantify how much wealth has been produced by the Group and how it has
been redistributed among all its stakeholders in order to provide a complete picture of the economic impact
that the company produces. It represents the economic value generated by the Group in the reference period
net of amortisation and depreciation, redistributed, in various forms, to the Group's stakeholders. It is therefore
the difference between revenues and costs incurred for the purchase of production factors (Operating costs and
other costs) and for human capital (Personnel costs), as payment to the Public Administration (Taxes) and to
Lenders (Financial expenses), and as contributions to community support (Donations and sponsorships).

The schedule showing how the Economic Value generated by Prysmian is allocated was prepared with reference
to the income statement items reported in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2019. The
economic value generated by Prysmian in 2019 amounted to EUR 11,653 million, of which EUR 296 million con-
sisted of profits redistributed to Group Members and interest to third parties and represent the value withheld.
Much of the value was redistributed in the form of:

e spending on Suppliers (80.8%) - including raw materials and other services;
e payment to Staff (13.6%);

e payment to Lenders (4.3%);

e payment to the Public Administration (1.3%);

e contributions to the Community, around EUR 610 thousand (0.005 %).
