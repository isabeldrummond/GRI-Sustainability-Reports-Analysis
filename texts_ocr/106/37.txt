STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MATERIALITY ANALYSIS

DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS

The sustainability strategy of the Prysmian Group is founded on continuous dialogue with our stakeholders.
The pursuit of corporate goals requires the development of forms of dialogue and ongoing interaction with
internal and external stakeholders, in order to understand their needs, interests and expectations, anticipate
changes and identify emerging trends, thus enabling the Group to pursue its own sustainable development go-
als and generate shared and consistent added value in the long run.

In order to identify the various categories of Group stakeholder, documentary analyses of the overall context

ment within the Group.
