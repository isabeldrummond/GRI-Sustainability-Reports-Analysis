Cyber security risks

The increasing spread of technologies that allow the transfer and sharing of sensitive information via virtual
spaces leads to the emergence of IT vulnerabilities. In particular, the exposure to potential cyber attacks derives
from several factors, such as the global distribution of IT systems and the cloud storage of high value-added
information (such as patents, technological innovation projects, as well as financial projections and strategic
plans not yet disclosed to the market). The Group IT Security Department, in collaboration with the Risk Mana-
gement function, periodically carries out specific assessments to identify any vulnerabilities in IT systems at
local and central level that could compromise business continuity.

In 2016, Prysmian defined:

e anInformation Security Strategy that clarifies the related governance structure adopted by the Group and gui-
delines for cyber risk management in the field of IT architectures and company processes.

e anInformation Security Risk Management (ISRM) Manual that, in line with the Group ERM Policy, defines the
methodology and the responsibilities for the identification, assessment and treatment of risks that could com-
promise the achievement of security objectives and therefore the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
Group information. The Threat Model was defined in 2019. As one of the data sources for ISRM, this metho-
dology is used to assess the relevance of events and the cyber threats posed by agents within and external to
the Group. The model makes it possible to characterise and prioritise cyber risks based on the actual scale and
importance of the threats to which the Group is exposed, drawing on national and international threat intelli-
gence sources, as well as the productive and geographical contexts in which the Group operates.

e aspecial Information Security Committee, comprising the main players involved in the management of cyber
risk'®. The task of this committee is to define the strategic and operational cyber security objectives, coordina-
te major initiatives and review and approve policies, procedures and operational instructions. The Committee
meets ona regular basis (twice annually) and in the case of crises or remarkable events.

 

During 2019, social engineering and phishing campaigns were carried out within the entire Prysmian Group (in-
cluding the former General Cable), aimed at testing the readiness of personnel to recognise these specific types
of cyber attack, and various security training sessions were provided to all employees and new hires, including
the coverage of specific security initiatives.

With particular reference to the former General Cable perimeter, two technical vulnerability assessments and
penetration tests were completed in 2019, as part of the integration programme, one at the US HQ and the other
at the most important EMEA plant. The activities envisaged in the integration plan will continue in 2020.

16 The permanent members of the Information Security Committee are: the Chief Operating Officer, the Vice-President HR & Organisation, the Chief Security Officer, the
Chief Information Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, the Internal Audit & Compliance Director and the IT Security Manager of the Group.
