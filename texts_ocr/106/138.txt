The web questionnaire approach was agreed with various countries during 2019, starting in southern Europe
(France and Italy, in particular), thus enabling other business units, countries and/or regions to leverage acom-
mon methodology and, at the same time, carry out independent surveys based on their needs during the year.

RAPID, TARGETED AND EFFICIENT RESPONSES

Plant reliability

The objective of this process is to improve reliability in the planning and execution of outputs (including respon-
se times) and rigorous stock control for each type of component.

Supply chain integration

The “supply chain integration projects’“ developed with a number of key global customers seek to improve pro-
cesses throughout the entire chain, from the producers of raw materials to the end user.

Fast Order Entry

This project will reduce the time taken to input and process orders, considerably improving the flexibility, time-
liness and efficiency of deliveries by all our logistics operations.

INNOVATIONS FOR CUSTOMERS

Cable App

The Cable App project has been developed over the past year, as part of innovation in the area of customer cen-
tricity. The main purpose of this App is to identify the most suitable cable and cross section based on the electri-
cal installation parameters, as well as to offer video and technical content to the installers. A reseller locator
function is also available.

This tool offers the following benefits:
e improved communications between installers and professionals,
e reduced total cost of ownership (TCO),

e enhanced positioning of Prysmian as an important player in the digital market, differentiated from competi-
tors by asolution that is easy to use, complete and professional.

The App is available to both customers and installers in Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy, Tur-
key, Norway and Argentina. A global launch plan has also been prepared.
