Corporate Governance

Effective and efficient, in order to create long-term sustainable value
and produce a virtuous circle with business integrity at its core.

Prysmian is aware of the importance of a good corporate governance system in order to achieve strategic objec-
tives and create long-term sustainable value, by having a system that is effective in complying with the legal
and regulatory framework, efficient in terms of cost-effectiveness, and fair towards all the Group's stakeholders.

Accordingly, Prysmian Group keeps its corporate governance system constantly in line with latest recommenda-
tions and regulations, adhering to national and international best practices.

Inaddition, the Group has adopted principles, rules and procedures that govern and guide the conduct of activi-
ties by all its organisational and operating units, as well as ensuring that all business transactions are carried out
in an effective and transparent manner.

Corporate Governance Structure

The model of governance and control adopted by Prysmian is the traditional one, with the presence of a general
meeting of the shareholders, a Board of Directors and a Board of Statutory Auditors. Prysmian’s corporate gov-
ernance structure is based on the central role of the Board of Directors (as the most senior body responsible for
managing the company in the interests of shareholders) in shaping strategy, in ensuring the transparency of
the decision-making process and in establishing an effective system of internal control and risk management,
including decision-making processes for both internal and external affairs.
