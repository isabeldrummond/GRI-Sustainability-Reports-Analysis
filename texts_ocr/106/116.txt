| Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 115

 

The commitment of the Group to protect health and safety is guaranteed by the Corporate HSE function, which
coordinates the local HSE functions: Region, Country and Plant.

The HSE function plans its activities based on an analysis of the specific parameters for the prior year, the results
of which are agreed with top management. The purpose of analysing Group performance is to define objectives
and action plans, as well as improvements for the coming year.

The established objectives and results (indices for the frequency and gravity of injuries) were achieved in 2019
and the following improvement projects were completed:

e further use of the Group's Blumatica HSE Events platform for the management of such HSE events as inciden-
ts, non-conformities, near misses and reporting;

e more effective and standardised analysis of the above events using international methodology: ISHIKAWA
DIAGRAM &5 WHYs;

e inorder to avoid the repetition of significant events, the Group continues to publish technical and organisa-
tional recommendations to be implemented at plant level;

e the promotion of meetings has continued at all levels in order to analyse the results obtained and the diffi-
culties encountered by the various geographical areas and business units; a further goal is to share the expe-
rience and present the initiatives and tools promoted by the central HSE function;

e technical / organisational support exchanges between area and central functions are encouraged, in order
to harmonise the approach taken to health and safety, as well as to support assessment of the safety aspects
of new investment;

e special attention has been focused on the safety of machinery, with the definition of a Group procedure
establishing reference standards, roles and responsibilities for the installation, basic maintenance and tech-
nical specifications of plant, as well as the minimum safety and protection requirements.

The safety efforts made by the Group have resulted in a reduction of injuries, as represented by the IF index cal-
culated using the OHSA LTA methodology". This index was about 1.30 at the end of 2019.

Accidents were monitored also with reference to other parameters such as:
e theirseverity assessed in relation to days of absence from work;

e the numbers of Near Misses, which are unfortunately still below expectations (subject of future investiga-
tion and corrective action).

With regard to the number of injuries, there were a total of 342 in 2019”, 320 involving men and 22 involving wo-
men*. In terms of geographical area, 283 injuries occurred in EMEA, 24 in LATAM, 18 in APAC and the remaining
17 in North America.

31 This methodology is described in the “Methodology” and at the foot of the tables in the “Attachments”.

32 The calculation of injuries only considers those that occurred in the workplace and not those arising during travel between home and work, unless organised by the
Company.

33 For privacy reasons, gender data for 2018 was not available in certain countries; accordingly, the proportion of injuries and hours worked were based on the FTEs at
31:12. A full analysis of injuries by gender was available for 2019, but the hours worked had to be determined in proportion to the FTEs at 31.12.2019.
