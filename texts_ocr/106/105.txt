International mobility

As of 31 December 2019, the Prysmian Group's expat population counts about 244 employees from about
24 different countries (32% are Italians) who are living in 33 different destination countries. Of these, 70%
are at anon-executive level and 20% are women. There were 80 new departures during 2019. These stati-
stics evidence the importance of international mobility within the Group. On the one hand, it allows the
diffusion of the culture and values of Prysmian in all countries and all affiliates — an essential requirement
following the acquisition of General Cable—and on the other hand, international mobility helps us meet lo-
cal organisation requirements, enabling the transfer of managerial and technical Know-how from country
to country, as well as the spread of multiculturalism which enhances the benefits of diversity.

In this regard, the mobility policy and processes were extended also to General Cable with a view to ali-
gnment with the most advanced market practices, in order to facilitate expatriation also outside of head-
quarters, to align conditions and to segment the various types of assignment.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

Prysmian has identified the promotion of diversity and equal opportunity as a strategic objective for the mana-
gement of human resources and, therefore, the development of an increasingly inclusive organisation. Given
this commitment, the Group has adopted a global Diversity & Inclusion Policy and is developing a number of
supporting initiatives. The latter are included in the Group's Side by Side programme. This was launched in 2016
and now focuses on diversity in terms of gender, age and culture as drivers for the creation of value in line with
our business objectives.

The portfolio of activities, mostly launched in 2017 with subsequent consolidation and extensions, includes:

1. Global Diversity Recruitment Policy. This procedure, formalised at corporate level, seeks to promote com-
pliance with the recruitment process, offering a standardised methodology that ensures equal opportunity
at all stages in the selection process, without any stereotypes linked to gender or other diversities. The Di-
versity Recruitment Policy was formalised at global level in March 2019. It has been translated into seven
languages in addition to English (Italian, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian and Chinese) and
is accompanied by an internal communications campaign entitled “Turn off your bias”. The objective is to
highlight errors that are typically, albeit subconsciously, made during selection processes, raising awareness
about them and prompting improved decisions and behaviour;

2. inclusion of the topic of diversity and diversity management in all programmes of the School of Manage-
ment, i.e. as part of the syllabus of the Prysmian Group Academy, which trains leaders of the Group;

3. involvement of senior managers as teachers in the Professional School programmes, in order to ensure
that the new generations, in particular, benefit from their experience and knowledge;
