As described in the Annual Report in the section on Risk Factors and Uncertainties, to which reference is made,
the Group's main business/function managers are involved in the annual process of identifying and evaluating the
most significant risk factors. These include economic sustainability, environmental and social issues. A common
and clearly defined methodology is used to measure and evaluate specific risk events in terms of their impact,
probability of occurrence and the level of adequacy of the control system in place.

In 2019, the above-mentioned process led to the identification of risks - some linked purely to sustainability and
others that may have a sustainability impact (and therefore also contained in the Annual Report in the section on
“Risk Factors and Uncertainties”) — to which the Group is exposed under its business model. Relevant information,
including the key strategies adopted to mitigate the risks, is presented below.

A process for updating the sustainability risk assessment was developed in 2020, with a view to refining the analy-
sis and integrating ESG topics more closely within the ERM process. The results of this approach will be included in
the 2020 non-financial statement.
