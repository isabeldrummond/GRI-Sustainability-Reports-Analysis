e identification of the main impacts (positive and/or negative) of the Group's activities throughout the Pry-
smian value chain, including additional new actions that the Group may implement to contribute to sustai-
nable development;

e assessment and prioritisation of sustainability issues through a structured survey aimed at bringing the con-
tribution of external stakeholders into the materiality analysis;

e assessment, via an interactive workshop, of stakeholder perception of the Group's initiatives and activities
regarding the targets of the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs).

The multi-stakeholder event organised by the Group in 2019 involved stakeholders from all over Europe. The
event, held at the Prysmian headquarters in Milan, was attended by about 70 stakeholders who, in addition to
deciding the material issues faced by the Group, discussed risks, opportunities and actions in relation to 4 key
topics for Prysmian: environment, ethics and integrity, social responsibility and innovation. At around the same
time, the Group also conducted a survey of key external stakeholders (customers, suppliers, universities and
research centres, investors and trade unions) in order to reach a larger number and obtain additional feedback.

To define and implement its stakeholder engagement path, the Prysmian Group follows the guidelines of the
2015 updated version of the AA1000SES International Standard, developed by AccountAbility (Institute of So-
cial and Ethical Accountability).

GROUP MATERIAL TOPICS

Inorder to identify the latest trends in sustainability, integrate the expectations of stakeholders within the acti-
vities of the organisation and define reports that satisfy the requirements of stakeholders and the priorities of
the Group, Prysmian launched a process in 2019 to update the materiality analysis in order to identify the most
significant sustainability issues for its business.

This update took account of the requirements specified in Decree 254/2016 and the recent acquisition of Gene-
ral Cable.

The matrix update process had two phases:
1. Desk analysis

During the desk analysis phase, documentary analysis of internal and external sources identified the full range
of topics to be assessed. The following sources were considered:

e reports and articles on global trends (e.g. World Economic Forum);

e industry trends/reports;

e sustainability reports/non-financial statements of peers and competitors;
e changes in regulations.

Based on the results of benchmarking, a number of topics were included, renamed, aggregated or eliminated.
With respect to the 2018 matrix and the results of benchmarking, the following changes were made in the 2019
materiality analysis:

e anti-corruption, included as part of “Ethics and business integrity’;

e product quality, safety and reliability, included in “Customer Centricity” and “Development and Eco-design
innovation’;

e bio-diversity, not included in the range of topics;
