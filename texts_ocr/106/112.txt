THE WELLBEING OF OUR EMPLOYEES

REMUNERATION POLICIES”®

The remuneration policy adopted by the Prysmian Group is designed to attract and recognise talent with the
skills needed to address the complexity and specialised nature of the business, as well as the competitive inter-
national context in which the Group operates. This policy is defined in a way that aligns the long-term intere-
sts of employees, management and shareholders, pursuing the priority objective of creating sustainable value
over time for all stakeholders. The remuneration policy is largely founded on the principle of sharing the results
achieved, via systems that establish a real and verifiable link between pay and performance, both individually
and at Group level.

Participation in the creation of sustainable value over time is open to all employees, via the broad Group share
ownership plan that enables employees to become stable shareholders. The broad share ownership plan (known
as YES — Your Employee Shares) was extended during 2019 to the new employees who joined the Group on the
merger with General Cable Corporation. About one third of employees are stable shareholders in the Group, ow-
ning more than 1.5% of the share capital.

Sustainability plays an increasingly important role in the remuneration policy of the Group. Part of the variable
remuneration of all Group managers is linked to the achievement of sustainability targets, which are monitored
using both internal indicators (gender diversity in management, culture of safety in the workplace, reduction of
emissions) and the third-party assessments provided by sustainability indexes.

Remuneration policy is defined at central level for executives and expatriates while, for the rest of the popu-
lation, local programmes are implemented in compliance with guidelines for remuneration systems defined
centrally.

The remuneration policy for executive directors and executives with strategic responsibilities is determined as
the result of an agreed and transparent process, during which the Compensation, Appointments and Sustaina-
bility Committee and the Board of Directors of the Group both play a central role. Every year the Committee sub-
mits the remuneration policy to the Board of Directors for approval and checks on its application during the year.
The pay structure for executive directors and managers with strategic responsibilities and executives comprises
a fixed component, a short-term variable component and a medium-long-term variable component.

The remuneration policy has been well received by shareholders (votes in favour exceeded 90%). Feedback and
suggestions regarding the remuneration policy are sought regularly from investors and shareholders, and con-
sidered when preparing the compensation policy that is submitted to a consultative vote at the annual general
meeting.

In the context of transparency on compensation matters, the Group has issued guidelines, in compliance with
local laws, that link pay measures to all levels of the organisation and variable remuneration plans to the apprai-
sal of individual performance. The fixed element of remuneration is reviewed annually and, if necessary, upda-
ted to remain competitive with market conditions, the position held and personal performance, while always
complying with local regulations. This meritocratic approach is based on a global system of organisational role
and performance assessment, which is applied on a consistent basis throughout the entire Group.
