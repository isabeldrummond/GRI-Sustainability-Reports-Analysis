32 I Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019

 

OUR TARGETS FOR 2022 - SCORECARD

The strategy definition process followed in 2016 resulted in the first “Sustainability Scorecard”, comprising 16
strategic objectives with targets for 2020. The annual progress report is included in the Non-Financial Declara-
tions made by the Group.

Following the acquisition of General Cable in 2018, the Group began to implement its own sustainability guide-
lines and monitoring systems within the new perimeter. This meant that 2018 reporting took place at a time of
transition and, therefore, for the sake of continuity with 2017, the sustainability performance of the Group as at
31.12.2018 was limited to the former Prysmian Group perimeter.

At this time, the sustainability priorities have been fully integrated within the former General Cable perimeter,
providing a unified strategic vision for the Group. It was necessary to revise the Scorecard following this inte-
gration, enabling Prysmian to take account of the change in perimeter and the time required to implement the
required sustainability actions throughout the Group.

This revision was carried out in accordance with the process described above and, therefore, took account of the
additional suggestions received following further stakeholder engagement and the latest requirements of the
Sustainability Indexes.

The Sustainability Scorecard has been updated to include the General Cable business, revising the KPIs and tar-
gets with 2019 as the baseline.

Accordingly, the Prysmian Group now has a new Sustainability Scorecard comprising 14 challenging targets to
be met by 2022. The entire process is monitored by the Sustainability Steering Committee, which is chaired by
the Chief Operating Officer of the Group.

The spread in China of COVID-19, caused by anovel coronavirus, began to have a significant impact on production
and trade in January 2020. The effects of COVID-19, which until early March were mainly felt in China, with early
signs in Italy, then rapidly expanded to the global level, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to desi-
gnate COVID-19 a pandemic.

The pervasive spread of the pandemic is leading governments in most countries to adopt containment mea-
sures such as restrictions on movement, quarantines and other public emergency measures that may cause di-
sruption of logistics processes, with impacts on sales and production as well.

These measures could be extended in duration and intensified as the pandemic develops, with impacts that
currently cannot be quantified at the level of the economic cycle and production, generating also a negative
influence on achievement of the sustainability targets set by the Group.
