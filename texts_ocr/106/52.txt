Prysmian Group I Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 51

 

The huge increase in the innovation category was due to the integration of General Cable NA (in innovation
terms, sales of Euro 67 million), with overall growth of 2.0% (+1.4% with respect to Q3 2018).

The good results of the product development category were principally attributable to the Trade & Installers
BU (49% of the entire category), up from 7.7% in Q3 2018 to 8.4% in the same quarter of 2019.
