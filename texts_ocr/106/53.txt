INNOVATIVE MATERIALS

Prysmian Group invests in advanced research to push the boundaries of innovation in the context of materials
and surface science for the production of cables and accessories. The main results achieved during 2019 include:

development of lead-free insulating compounds for SPEED line HV accessories; materials already tested on
model cables in the laboratory, with moulding planned at the Livorno plant;

complete industrialisation of anew sheathing material for the Oil & Gas sector, which will reduce costs due to
an improved resistance to oils with respect to the original compound;

new PVC formulations with improved flame-resistant properties, enabling the Giovinazzo plant to produce
smaller and more competitive cables;

development of anew LSOH compound for the sheathing of low voltage cables, able to significantly improve
the speed of extrusion without affecting cable performance;

development of a new class of compounds without halogens but with flame-retardant properties, intended
to be lighter with improved performance; in-depth analysis of the combustion mechanism, to better under-
stand the phenomenon and produce compounds whose performance reflects those concepts;

development of anew method for measuring the conductivity of gases produced by the combustion of mica
glass tapes and compounds for fire-resistant cables consistent with the type of materials used in this appli-
cation. This will be used scrupulously to understand the reliability of measurements and their applicability
in predicting the quality of a material;

in the field of low-weight submarine reinforcements, collaboration continues with a producer of ultra-high
molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibres, while the industrialisation of aramid fibre reinforcements
has been completed;

research into anew formulation for the coating of optical fibres using ecologically sustainable raw materials
has been completed. The performance of the primary coating is good, while that of the secondary coating
still needs improvement;

completion of the assessment of polyamids, with the introduction of a new class and the start of evaluation
work on a new type of polymer with an improved environmental impact, to replace PA for the sheathing of
optical cables and electric cables;

evaluation of nanocarbon structures, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, to replace metal as
lightweight high performance conductors.
