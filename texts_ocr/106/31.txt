Consistent with the Group's Sustainability Policy, the sustainability strategy adopted by Prysmian has identified
three strategic priorities with three strategic pillars:

I sustainable and innovative solutions for the business;
II responsible use of energy and natural resources;

The three pillars comprise 14 objectives to be reached by 2022, translating the strategic direction into concrete
