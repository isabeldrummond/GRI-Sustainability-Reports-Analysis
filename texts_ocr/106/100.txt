| Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 99

 

If the risk factors are not properly managed with corrective actions and treatment plans, the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of Group information cannot be properly protected. This may result in damage or finan-
cial losses (loss of market competitiveness due to margin reduction or cost increases), reputational losses (loss
of brand reputation), operational losses (business interruption or process delays) and legal losses (non-com-
pliance with regulations, laws and contractual requirements).

At the beginning of 2019, the Group defined and adopted a series of performance indicators to evaluate the le-
vel of information security. By using KPIs and KRIs systematically, Prysmian Group can obtain a continuous and
updated overview of security, detecting potential deficiencies and addressing them in a timely manner.

These indicators cover all areas of the information security framework defined at Group level, targeting two dif-
ferent needs: business metrics provide management with the clearest and most direct status information, while
echnical metrics measure the efficiency and adequacy of the technological solutions adopted.

Once again, during 2019 the Information Security Committee supervised the operating plans for the implemen-
ation of planned initiatives, with periodic updates.

Over 40 information security events (“incidents”) of varying severity were managed every month during 2019.

In addition, 105 Internet domains used for phishing and ransomware campaigns were identified and reported to
he competent authorities. Each month, more than 130 security clearances were issued, authorising significant
changes to IT systems or providing access to critical resources. Lastly, 26 internal investigations were conducted
o contain and prevent theft and fraud, and to tackle potential reputational losses.

There were no known violations of the confidential personal data of Group customers during 2019.

 

Furthermore, no reports were received from external parties or public or private regulatory bodies, as identified
from the periodic investigations carried out by the Security organisation using OSINT intelligence sources.

Group procedures and operating instructions for the management of data breaches were formalised in 2018.

Commitment and support for this topic by the Group resulted in the publication during 2019 of hardening gui-
delines for IT systems (internal and external) subject to the GDPR, as well as a draft data disposal and retention
policy. In addition, various awareness initiatives regarding the corporate intranet were carried out.
