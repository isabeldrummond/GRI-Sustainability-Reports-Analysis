OUR SUPPLIERS

The majority of the Group's purchases of raw materials comprise metals (especially copper and aluminium),
which are fundamental resources for Group activities.

With regard to the procurement of metals, Prysmian purchases copper and aluminium wire rod from the wor-
ld’s leading manufacturers, as raw material for the manufacture of conductors for cables. Only in specific ca-
ses, Prysmian self-produces copper wire rod starting from copper cathodes and aluminium wire rod, liquid
aluminium, or from ingots. In such cases, the volumes produced are less than 10% for copper and 25% for
aluminium compared to total consumption. The Group uses about 2-3% of the world’s copper production and
about 7% of the copper used in the electrical and electronic sector. Given the highly fragmented copper mar-
ket, the Prysmian Group is one of the leading economic players in the sector.

The Group's sourcing of metals takes two strategic directions taking into account:
e theimportance of suppliers within the Group's value chain;

e thehigh consumption of metal;

 

e thewide geographical distribution of Prysmian production sites.

Prysmian seeks to use the most integrated manufacturers who can guarantee long-term supplies and have di-
rect access to raw materials (mining or concentrates), thus creating real industrial partnerships so as to ensure
supplies in the long run through reciprocal volume commitments.

The Group also works with the world’s leading producers, with the aim of ensuring the most efficient coverage of
its needs, optimising the metal logistics chain through short-term agreements (typically annual and with high
flexibility of volumes) in order to ensure greater reactivity.

Also with regard to the purchase of aluminium, the Group focuses increasingly on suppliers that are vertically
integrated (with processes that manufacture aluminium rod directly from aluminium oxide), in preference to
those that are not integrated (manufacturers that smelt aluminium ingots in order to produce rod). This strate-
gy assures the security of supplies and also has cost and environmental advantages, due to simplification of the
logistics and elimination of the ingot re-smelting cycle.

Lastly, given that the aluminium production process requires considerable electricity consumption, Prysmian
has included the carbon footprint associated with the various production processes as a supplier selection cri-
terion, assigning a consideration portion of the business portfolio to suppliers capable of supplying aluminium
with a lower environmental impact.

Long-term strategies for the purchase of copper and aluminium naturally lead Prysmian to work with the largest
and most important companies in the respective sectors. With regard to the principal quantities of non-ferrous
metals, this approach enables the Group to deal with suppliers that focus strongly on all aspects of sustainabi-
lity, thus creating a highly sustainable end-to-end cycle. Integration with General Cable has also added an alu-
minium wire rod production facility to the business in North America. This activity is well integrated with group
strategies as the wire rod is produced directly from liquid aluminium sourced from a neighbouring supplier.
