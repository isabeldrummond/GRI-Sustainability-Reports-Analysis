Specific actions to prevent corrupt practices within the Group include:

Implementation of the “Third Party Program” during 2019. This new Group policy is intended to prevent and
manage the risk of corruption deriving from relations with third parties (such as agents, distributors and
certain categories of supplier). In particular, before establishing business relations with any third party, it is
necessary to carry out due diligence in relation to that party using a dedicated on-line platform. As a result
of the above activity, a level of risk (high, medium, low) is assigned to each third party that, consequently,
is subjected to an approval procedure responsive to the identified risks Additionally, the due diligence work
must be repeated every 1, 3 or 5 years, depending on the level of risk identified. Further, the Code of Ethics
adopted by the Group (which includes the anti-corruption clause) is accepted and signed by all contractors,
suppliers and agents and, with the introduction of the new Third Party Program, all new agents, distributors
and 15 categories of suppliers must also sign the anti-corruption certificate.

Supply of periodic information from each area to the Supervisory Body, pursuant to Decree 231/2001. These
areas comprise:

New Prysmian agents;
Results of due diligence;

Commission payments above a certain threshold.

E-learning (training and testing) activities for compliance with the anti-bribery rules applicable to all Group
personnel. In particular, it should be noted that, during 2019, specific classroom training sessions were held
aimed at the Group's sales force, organized in collaboration with external lecturers and legal consultants. At
the same time, e-learning sessions are published on the company intranet. In 2019, about 100 white-collar
employees were trained in compliance and anti-corruption matters through on-line courses, while 1,024 were
trained in classroom sessions (classroom sessions include both Anti-Corruption and Anti-Trust modules).

Training in how to use the new platform to carry out due diligence work on third parties, as mentioned ear-
lier. In particular, 1,463 white collar employees were trained in classroom sessions and conference calls du-
ring 2019.

Implementation of ACL (a software programme that enables the extraction of bulk information from SAP or
other information systems), with the definition of anumber of key indicators for the “General/Ledger” and
“Accounts Payable” processes. The system can also be used to monitor the high transaction risks associated
with agents.

n 2017, the Prysmian Group, in line with the objectives set in 2016, decided to further strengthen the mo-
nitoring and central focus on compliance issues by launching an Anti-Bribery Compliance Program inspired
by the guidelines set by the ISO 37001: 2016 “Anti-bribery management systems”. This program, in addi-
ion to giving greater control over the management of the risk of corruption, is also aimed at minimizing
he risk of being subject to sanctions following the commission of corruptive offences by employees or
hird parties. The core of the ISO 37001 standard, as is known, is the control of third parties (suppliers, in-
ermediaries, agents and customers) through a due diligence system aimed at bringing out any critical or
negative events that undermine the reputation of third parties with whom the Prysmian Group interacts.
The programme introduced in 2017 has remained current throughout 2019.

The compliance policies of Prysmian and General Cable were reviewed, updated and merged in 2019, in or-
der to create documentation valid for the entire Group. With specific reference to the anti-corruption pro-
gramme, the relevant policy was revised together with that covering gifts and entertainment expenses.
n particular, the anti-corruption policy now provides further clarification about the requirements to be met
with regard to high-risk transactions, such as donations, sponsorships, governmental interactions/projects,
business relations with high-risk third parties (e.g. agents, consultants), gifts and entertaining expenses re-
lated to the Public Administration.
