PROJECTS

Submarine cables

Work on the three-core high voltage cables with aluminium conductors and transition connectors for cables with copper con-
ductors was largely completed during 2019, with execution of the official type trials, additional internal testing to optimise
the production processes at the plant, and the pre-qualification ageing tests. The bi-metallic connectors (aluminium and cop-
per conductors joined together) allow effective optimisation of the entire link by only using the more expensive conductors
close to the shore and in the landfall section, while also optimising the choice of conductor for the rest of the subsea link, thus
improving the sustainability of the connection.

In addition, a specific programme has commenced for the development of an upgraded class of high voltage a.c. (HVAC)
cables for use in offshore wind farm installations. This programme is due to be completed within three years, with the objecti-
ve of manufacturing cable systems that allow electricity transmission at a lower total cost (production, installation and ope-
ration), thus minimising the cost per MW transmitted per unit of length.

The development programme will focus on activities designed to increase the operational voltage, increase the size of the
conductor and study other technical functionalities, such as the use of materials with low heat resistance, thinner lead shea-
thing or lead-free solutions, transition conductors and asymmetric and bi-metallic Millikens.

Inthe context of this programme, the pre-qualification tests up to 400 kV commenced in 2019. The first full-scale three-core
275 kV prototype is under construction and will be completed in early 2020. The steady increase in power production by off-
shore wind farms and their increasing distance from the shore require efficient solutions for transporting the energy to shore
effectively, thus facilitating the growth of electricity generated from renewable sources.

With regard to impregnated paper technology, a solution has been developed and produced for a particularly large conductor
that operates at 600 KV. Initial tests were positive and the qualification programme up to 60°C has been defined and will be
executed during 2020. The electrical performance of the prototype using MI PPL technology (polypropylene laminate and
impregnated paper), manufactured in 2018, has been evaluated carefully after undergoing severe bending tests, while the
full programme to assess performance up to 800 kV is scheduled for 2020.

The innovative, lighter three-core cable with synthetic armor manufactured in 2019 has been installed successfully in an initial
project in very deep water, confirming that these solutions can further facilitate the optimisation of power distribution grids,
thus allowing the better use of renewable energy and reducing the reliance on fossil fuels.

 

Development projects using extrusion technology up to 600 kV DC continued according to plan during the year, with the use
of XLPE and P-Laser as insulation materials.

 

Attention during 2019 focused on the development of a complete system (cable, flexible connectors, dual terminations and
sockets) with large conductor operating at 400 KV. In particular, development of the connector was studied, applying two
different underlying technologies. The lengthy ageing test process during the pre-qualification phase commenced in 2019
and the full qualification programme will be completed in 2020.

Cables for submarine applications must be protected from water and humidity, currently requiring the use of watertight lead
sheaths: lead shield solutions with reduced thickness that reduce losses (thus improving system efficiency) were developed
further during 2019, with a positive impact on the environment. New solutions were also found for re-inserting the lead sheath
inthe connectors, where the reduction in thickness is a crucial factor.

The path towards a totally lead-free solution in the cable submarine market is proceeding rapidly, with other development
activities related to lead-less technology involving the adoption of a longitudinally welded copper sheath. A number of pro-
totypes were made in 2019 in order to optimise the configuration of the cable, even for very challenging applications, and
improve reliability in the production of long lengths.

 

Efforts and studies to integrate sensors in the cable effectively continued during 2019. The project seeks to integrate within
the cable a smart diagnostic system able to prevent issues during operation of the system, allowing preventive maintenance
and minimising the repair time, while also detecting the fault position rapidly in order to reduce system repair and down time.
