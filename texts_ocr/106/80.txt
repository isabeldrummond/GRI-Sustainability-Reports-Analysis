Environmental risks

The Group's manufacturing activities in Italy and abroad are subject to specific environmental regulations. The-
se cover, in particular, the management of raw materials, energy resources and hazardous substances, atmo-
spheric emissions and waste, as well as the prevention of pollution and minimisation of the impact on environ-
mental factors (soil, sub-soil, water resources and the atmosphere).

Furthermore, changes in these regulations tend to impose increasingly stringent requirements on firms, which
must therefore incur significant costs associated with the action needed to comply with the various obligations.

Given the large number of Group plants, the probability of an incident with environmental consequences and
possible loss of production continuity brings the real possibility of significant economic and reputational im-
pacts. For this reason, Prysmian adopts a series of control procedures that keep risk at an acceptable level. En-
vironmental issues are managed centrally by the Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) function. By coordinating
the local HSE functions, this function organises specific training and adopts systems intended to guarantee stri-
ct compliance with the regulations in accordance with best practices, in addition to monitoring the exposures to
risk using specific indicators and by performing internal and external checks.

Lastly, 83% of plants within the Prysmian Group perimeter (including those acquired together with General
Cable) have ISO 14001 (environmental management) certification.

Risks related to climate change

Growing international focus on the consequences of climate change with predicted far-reaching repercussions
on ecosystems, economies, human health and well-being, require companies to assess the potential impact on
their businesses that might arise in the medium to long term.

In 2017, taking into account the guidelines of the 2015 COP21 conference in Paris, the Prysmian Risk Management
functions and the Group HSE carried out a climate change risk analysis with the aim of evaluating the potential
impact on Prysmian business operations (chronic physical risks"). In line with the IPCC AR5 Fifth Assessment
Report and the related Annex I, the analysis looked at the three main climate change layers:

e increase in sea level (estimated by 2100);
e change intemperatures (estimated in a 2016-2035 projection period);
e change in precipitation in summer and winter (estimated in a projection period 2016-2035).

By using the “CatNet” online platform made available to Prysmian by the Swiss Re insurance company, the Risk
Management team and the Group's HSE team jointly analysed the geographical position and altitude of its plan-
ts on the global map, in an effort to identify which of them could be exposed to climate change risk factors.

The plants within the new General Cable perimeter were analysed during 2019 and the results did not modify the
overall exposure of the Group, as confirmed below.
