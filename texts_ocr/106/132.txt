Also, with regard to Scope 1 emissions, it should be noted that refrigerant gas refills, which are considered in
order to quantify the relative fugitive emissions, do not occur consistently every year but are instead carried
out intermittently (according to need) even at long-term intervals, resulting in a minimally linear trend, with
possible jumps up and down.

 

WASTE

The main types of waste generated by productive activities have been split into specific categories, classifying
their level of danger (hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste) according to the related classification system,
regardless of the country of origin and disposal of the waste. An exception is made for certain types of waste (such
as laboratory chemicals), whose allocation among the categories depends on local regulatory requirements.

Overall, the quantity of waste produced by the Prysmian Group in 2019 totalled 169,618,723 tonnes; hazardous
waste represented 8.4 % of the total of waste produced.

As can be seen from the following charts, the production of power cables generates the majority of hazardous
waste: 53.3%.

By contrast with reference to non-hazardous waste, certain types are eliminated intermittently, based on pro-
duction needs and therefore even every few years, resulting in non-linear trends with large swings in either di-
rection. In addition, since certain types of waste are production performance indicators, especially scrap me-
tals, the central functions (HSE and Manufacturing) are carrying out detailed checks to align at Group level the
way that waste is collected and reported.
