Our customer-centric approach
Central to our activities: our customers.

Customers are central to everything we do, we work to meet their needs in the most efficient and satisfactory
manner possible, from design to execution. Our cables are made to meet customer needs. We collaborate
with them when developing new products, many of which are designed for greater sustainability. During cu-
stom-made projects, customers are invited to our plants in order to supervise the production process.

The Prysmian Group monitors customer satisfaction via web surveys and personal interviews and, in addition,
ensures an element of flexibility throughout the entire supply chain with a view to accelerating the time to
market and adapting to customer requirements in each sector.

The global footprint of the Prysmian Group means that we are well positioned to respond to the different
needs of customers, serving highly differentiated segments and markets thanks to a matrix organisational
structure: from highly specific local markets with the business and development structures of individual
countries, to the global customers for which our business units in different countries cooperate.

UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS

Personal interviews

Prysmian Group began to carry out personal interviews in 2015. These interviews are carried out annually with
strategic customers and managed directly by the Group's E&I Customer Centricity manager, in close collabo-
ration with the sales functions at country/region level. The topics covered include conditions of sale, product
range, logistics and services, marketing and branding, and overall business strategies.

During 2019, 25 key customers were interviewed in Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and the
United States. As a result, specific actions were identified for development in 2019, in order to respond to the
needs expressed by customers in different geographical regions.

For the first time since the merger with General Cable, during 2019 this activity involved all 3 major Group brands
-Prysmian, Draka and General Cable.

Web surveys of customer satisfaction

Prysmian carries out web surveys to measure the level of customer satisfaction and improve the level of pro-
blem solving achieved. These surveys are carried out using a platform connected with Salesforce, the Prysmian
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, thus allowing countries that already use the CRM to view
the survey results on their portals. The surveys examine the conditions of sale, products and services, customer
support, brand awareness and the ranges offered, identifying at least 28 main drivers in these categories.

The 2019 web questionnaires were used in northern Europe (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland) and in Spain;
onascale from1 (minimum) to 5 (maximum), the following average scores were obtained across 30 drivers.
