ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIPS

Collaboration is essential for sustainable innovation in the energy and telecom sectors and the Prysmian Group
contributes actively to tackling these new challenges.

Leadership of the cables sector is strengthened by the inclusion of the Group in the principal and most strategic
global trade associations. In fact, participation in technical round-table discussions means that Prysmian can
play a prominent role in the definition of guidelines and in debates with partners and competitors.

Collaboration with other market players in the drafting of technical and regulatory solutions helps to make the
entire sector stronger and more innovative, consolidating in this way the leadership of the Prysmian Group.

As a leader in the cables sector, the Prysmian Group must play a proactive role in tackling promptly the new
problems that emerge and finding solutions by sharing best practices with the entire sector. Prysmian Group is
an active participant within the main industry associations and sector groupings, defining relevant policy guide-
lines together with partners and competitors. Achievement of the sustainability objectives requires teamwork
at sector level. Accordingly, our inclusion in industry groupings that seek to improve the sustainability of the
sector is strategic for the Group.
