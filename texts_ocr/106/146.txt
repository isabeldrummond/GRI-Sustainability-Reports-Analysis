RESPONSIBLE VALUE CHAIN

CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND OTHER POLICIES

With a view to ensuring that ethical, economic, environmental and social standards are met throughout the
value chain, in 2014 the Prysmian Group decided to promote a responsible and sustainable chain of supply by
adopting a Code of Business Conduct. This Code took effect in 2015 and applies to all employees and business
relations. The principles set down in the Code apply to the business transactions and daily activities of the em-
ployees of all Group entities and their suppliers, commercial partners, commercial agents, sub-contractors and
distributors.

The document covers the following topics:

e business integrity (fair trade, conflicts of interest, gifts and offers of entertainment, corruption,
accountability);

e human rights and workers’ rights (under-age working and slavery, occupational health and safety, non-di-
scrimination, freedom of association and collective bargaining);

e environment (principle of precaution, use of raw materials and compliance, energy consumption, greenhou-
se gases and other emissions, use of water, production of waste and recycling).

Prysmian’s application of the related guidelines is highlighted to suppliers at the scouting and qualification sta-
ges. In addition, the Group’s Human Rights Policy was extended by adding a specific chapter on the monitoring
and identification of potential breaches in the supply chain, with remedial action and, if necessary, the exclusion
from all commercial and business relations of suppliers that do not respond promptly to the standards required.

Additionally, from 2017, the Prysmian Group applies a Conflict Minerals Policy, with the aim of guaranteeing its
customers a “Conflict Minerals free” supply chain through the following activities:

e identification of purchased materials/semi-finished products containing 3TG (tin, tungsten, tantalum and
gold from the Democratic Republic of Congo or neighbouring countries);

e request to all regular suppliers regarding the sourcing of minerals used in their production processes (throu-
gh formats and international standards);

e analysis of information received and implementation of corrective actions.

The analysis of suppliers used in 2018 was completed during 2019. Considering the 4 minerals covered by the
Conflict Materials Policy, the Group purchases limited quantities of tin. Analysis of all 48 suppliers of tin to the
Group identified their original sources, comprising 68 different smelters; of these, 65 are certified “DRC Confli-
ct-free” by the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI). The remaining 3 were the subject of an analysis in accordan-
ce with instructions issued by the RMI (“Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry”). Overall, the investigation did
not identify any risk in this area.

Lastly, Group management of potential risks in the business relationship includes supplier approval of Prysmian’s
Code of Ethics. In particular, whenever a contract is awarded, the supplier must accept and sign the Group's Code
of Ethics, in full awareness of the related rights and obligations.
