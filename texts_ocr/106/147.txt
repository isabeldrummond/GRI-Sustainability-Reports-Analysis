ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF SUPPLIERS

With regard to the management of the supplier base, Prysmian qualifies its suppliers through a formal process
based on technical, economic and financial analysis; it examines information and data on, for example, the risk
of dependence on the supplier or the technical and technological capacity and skills of the suppliers.

In order to monitor the sustainability of the supply chain and reduce possible negative impact, the Group also
analyses, on a centralised and integrated basis, all risks and opportunities associated with the supply chain, fo-
cusing on the risks deemed most critical by the Group.

During 2019, the Prysmian Group finalised an internal Supply Chain Strategy document that governs the entire
supply chain of the materials needed. The process involved envisages:

e Arisk analysis by supplier for a large percentage of expenditure (the Group covered 63% of total expenditure
in 2019) using the Desk Analysis & Risk Analysis tool. The Desk Analysis carried out in 2019%° with regard to the
Group's strategic suppliers of base metals and raw materials covered three areas in particular: management
systems governing ethical sustainability and integrity, the environment, and human rights and workers’ ri-
ghts.

e Identification of potentially high-risk suppliers with regard to sustainability factors, weighted using the
following matrix: Importance (Expenditure and Business Impact) and Availability (Single Source and Geo-
graphical Location)

e Selection of suppliers identified by the risk analysis as “Potentially high risk” for Sustainability Audits (carried
out by an external provider)

e Analysis of the audit results and, if negative, activation of improvement actions.

Inthis regard, 8 supplier audits were carried out during 2019 and, from 2017 to date, 15 sustainability audits have
been carried out. Following the audits, the Group works with the suppliers to determine the action plan needed,
if applicable, in order to implement remedial actions.

In order to guarantee the quality of the materials purchased, the Group is committed to using only those raw
materials approved by the responsible technical functions following laboratory tests and extended processing
trials conducted both in-house and by qualified suppliers. This process seeks to check quality, environmental
and social aspects. The qualification process starts by sending a questionnaire that the supplier is required to
complete in full, addressing every aspect, including ESG issues.

 

If further work is needed or if the answers to the questionnaire are deemed not sufficiently complete, there isan
audit for materials classified as critical.
