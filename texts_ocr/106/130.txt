GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

Greenhouse gas emissions, measured in tonnes of CO, equivalen
indicated in “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition,
2004)” considering, for the Scope 1 GHG emissions (direct greenhouse gas emissions), the consumption of fuels,
the release of overflow refrigerant gas and the release of SF, and, for the Scope 2 GHG emissions (indirect emis-
sions of greenhouse gases), the consumption of purchased energy (mainly electricity).

 

, were calculated using the methodologies

The Prysmian Group is a multinational and diversified concern; for this reason, and consistent with the requi-
rements of the reporting standard, two main methods for accounting for emissions in Scope 2 are used: the
Location-based method and the Market-based method. Both methods, described below, are recognised and re-
quired by the GHG Protocol and are necessary for the reporting of Scope 2 emissions in the “CDP’s Climate Change

programme’ starting in 2016.

Location-based Market-based

 

This is a method for
quantifying Scope 2

It isa method to quantify the CO, emissions of Scope 2 based on the CO,
emissions emitted by the energy suppliers from which the reporter (company
CO, emissions based on that compiles the report) purchases, through a contract, an electricity

average emission factors package. Markets differ on the contracts available for the purchase of energy
for energy generation by or on the claim of specific attributes, but may include: guarantee certificates
well-defined geographical | of energy origin and direct contracts with suppliers (RECs, GOs, I-REC, etc.);

boundaries, including supplier-specific emission factors; default emission factors that represent
local, sub-national or uncontrolled or unclaimed energy and emissions (defined as “residual mix”);
national boundaries. regional or sub-national medium or national emission factors.
