Environmental responsibility

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

The Group Strives actively to safeguard and protect the environment and conserve natural resources, in order to
create sustainable value for the benefit of both the organisation and our stakeholders.

The Group's commitment to safeguarding the environment and conserving natural resources is expressed not
only by the intrinsic characteristics of our products, but also by how our production systems are managed. In
particular, the prevention and reduction of their environmental impact is achieved, for example, by the efficient
use of natural resources, the optimisation of logistics flows and the responsible management of waste.

This commitment is evidenced, in primis, by application of the Group's Health, Safety and Environment Policy,
Operating Procedures and Technical Standards, which were extended to additional operating units during the
year, and by the periodic checks supported by a team of auditors of the proper and effective application at local
level of the health, safety and environment rules.

During the year, the Prysmian Group worked hard to enhance our performance on environmental matters, by
monitoring key indicators and planning actions designed to reach, step by step, the environmental objectives
set for 2022.

In particular, the sustainability objectives set for the period to 2022 include - among others - the reduction of
energy consumption and the consequent reduction of greenhouse gas** (GHG) emissions at Group level.

In view of this, during 2019 the Prysmian Group again participated in the CDP - Climate Change section, in which
the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) for 2018 were declared.

In 2019, 19 new energy diagnoses were carried out in the same number of operating units, in accordance with
local legislative requirements and the criteria defined at Group level, aimed at having an ever more complete,
reliable and updated data base on energy consumption and its distribution, with the aim of extending energy
efficiency initiatives to an ever larger number of units. The Energy Audit Plan is updated annually by the HSE fun-
ction. The recently-acquired European plants of General Cable were included at the end of 2018, while the next
update for the three-year period 2020-2022 will also include the non-European locations.

A number of Group plants have ISO 50001 energy management certification (6 German plants and 1 Turkish
plant). Internal and external audits are planned and carried out periodically at these locations, in order to check
the adequacy of their energy management systems and verify achievement of the established objectives. The
auditors also make recommendations for possible new initiatives, as part of the continuous improvement of
energy management and consumption.

Responsibilities and procedures have been updated at the Milan HQ, where the energy management system also
has ISO 50001 certification, and a series of operational initiatives, involving every level of the organisation and
all employees and collaborators, have been launched to achieve the established energy reduction objectives.

Significant events during 2019 included the investment of about Euro 17 million in health, safety and environ-
mental activities, including energy efficiency, water and waste.

38 The emissions reduction targets refer to all the “direct” Scope 1 emissions (i.e. those resulting from the production processes) and “indirect” Scope 2 emissions
(deriving from energy purchased).
