Aninnovative solution has been devised in Latin America for the configuration of overhead lines (OHL) in steel-reinforced alu-
minium (ACSR) coated with additional insulation. This solution reduces the environmental impact of low voltage overhead
lines, reducing the need to plant trees along the route of the lines and, at the same time, increasing service reliability.

We are also using recycled materials for the PE sheathing of power distribution cables in Germany. The 30% use of recycled
materials (supplied by an external source) for the external covering has been approved, but the objective is to raise this to
50% or more

Oil & Gas

The Group has leveraged its broad technical know-how and considerable experience in the field to extend proprietary solu-
tions such as Drylam to Oman Cables Ind., as an alternative to the use of lead sheathing for instrument cables, power cables
and the low voltage hybrid cables employed in onshore applications in the 0&G sector.

The optimisation of the range of products for offshore applications has been extended successfully to ASEAN countries, in
order to serve local markets better and meet their needs.

This range of products has also benefited from the addition of improved functionality in explosive environments.

OEMs

Consistently with IEC 62930, a recent international standard, a new range of global products has been developed and laun-
ched for cables used in the photovoltaic sector. For each continent (North America, LATAM, EU, China and ASEAN), specific
sources have also been identified for production of the cables in order to optimise further the environmental impact of the
entire production and distribution process.

Large-scale photovoltaic systems mainly use three configurations of LVDC electrical cable. Copper interconnection cables are
used to link a series of photovoltaic panels or modules and are brought together at a branch point.

Larger section aluminium cables convey d.c. power from these points to the inverter and the transformer, which generate a.c.
power for the connection to the grid. Prysmian is a leader in terms of the fundamental performance and cost requirements
for cables used in modules and interconnections and for low voltage cables. Current development activity is focused on pro-
duction efficiency and optimisation of the design of materials so that the sector can contain the Balance of System (BOS)
costs, while maintaining or even improving performance. This process will make it possible to reduce energy consumption and
the use of chemical raw materials. In collaboration with CANENA (Council for the Harmonisation of Electrotechnical Standardi-
sation of the Nations of the Americas), Prysmian also supports an initiative to harmonise US, Mexican and Canadian standards
in order to promote efficiency by simplifying design and performance requirements and identify best practices.

 

While the conductors used for the interconnection of panels are generally subject to local standards, the regional certification
of the cables used in modules is giving way to designs that have been harmonised at a global level. This trend allows the lar-
ger OEMs to standardise their global procedures in terms of production flexibility, logistics and cost positioning, and has also
resulted in changes to the configuration of conductors and materials as part of the alignment with such standards as UL 4703
and IEC 62930. Globalisation has also generated an increase in market competitiveness and promoted initiatives designed to
use more efficient and sustainable interconnection technologies.

Wind turbines: various new ranges of cables and sets of cables with higher voltages, up to 66 kV, in order to enable customers
to increase the quantity of energy generated and improve the energy efficiency of wind power systems.

Rolling stock: ranges of products developed and certified in order to satisfy the most stringent fire-resistance and safety re-
quirements defined by the European and American regulations, thus enhancing the safety of the applications concerned.

Railways: alignment with European regulations and laws and with their definition of the fire-reaction requirements (CPR) for
railway tunnels, achieving the objective - as amember of Europacable - of meeting the highest safety standards prescribed by
law for European railway tunnels. The Group has developed and certified a completely new portfolio that implements the new
requirements, at both global and local/national levels.

Technical activity to support the development of applications for electric vehicles (EV) has continued, with the production
and approval of a complete range of cables for the a.c. charging systems used in the European market.
