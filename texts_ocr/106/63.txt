Connectivity

Prysmian has continued to expand the range of connectivity products for fibre-based broadband networks. Activities in 2019
focused on the last-mile products used to make the final connection to the customer. These products, positioned in the access
node or the point closest to the customer's home, allow rapid connection using drop cables pre-fitted with connectors. Both
solutions can be used with drop cables pre-fitted with connectors or standard SC connectors, offering a significant advantage
over the products usually used for this type of network, which employ reinforced connectors that are generally proprietary
in nature and onerous. Two main sets of products have been developed. The first is the PryConnect system, being a series of
boxes pre-fitted with connectors for 4, 8 or 12 drop cables. This is a generic product, developed for the general connectivity
market, that enables cables pre-fitted with connectors to be attached to the box easily, without any need to open it. The se-
cond is the PBO system pre-fitted with connectors for up to 6 drop cables, which has been designed specifically for the general
French market, where the box is usually opened to install a mid-span solution of flexible fibre tubes.

Optical fibre

Prysmian has continued to invest in the development of optical fibre products. In order to satisfy the growing need for fibres
that can be bent at will for use in FTTx systems, all types of Prysmian fibre were rendered insensitive to bending during 2019.
The entire portfolio of products is now compliant with standards G657A1 and G657A2, while alignment with standard G652D is
in progress. This generation of fibres can be compacted more within optical cables, allowing the production of smaller cables
with a greater fibre density. The tendency to request a larger number of fibres in the same space continues, especially in Eu-
rope. Alongside these product development activities, a cost containment programme has been implemented in view of the
current difficult conditions in the telecommunications market.

OPGW & Specials

In the OPGW & Specials BU, the Technology of stainless steel with aluminium coating has been consolidated up to 96 fibres
while the monotube aluminium extruded Technology has been further reinforced. Various projects have been developed
using these technologies, such as the OPGW supply contract with ENDESA (Spain) and ESKOM (South Africa). The Specials fa-
mily of products with high mechanical and chemical strength for applications such as sensing, OGP and sub-aqua has been fur-
ther developed. Various projects have been carried out using these technologies, including an undersea project in the United
States and a fibre network at the Amur refinery (Russia).

Multimedia Solutions (MMS)

For many years, Prysmian has offered cables for the pulse generators used in particle accelerators, such as CERN in Switzer-
land. These cables connect the pulse generators with the so-called “Kicker” magnets used to deflect a beam of particles du-
ring the various phases of acceleration or experimentation or, recently, in the Beam Dump system. Commencing from the
configuration developed for the CERN LHC, production of a new special cable for pulse generators for the FAIR project com-
menced successfully in 2019 at the GSI facility in Germany. Drawing on the new knowledge acquired with this project, deve-
lopment work has commenced on a new series of cables for pulse generators with high and accurately controlled frequency
parameters, up to several dozen MHz, that are designed to operate at several dozen KV. This small scale, but technologically
challenging project contributes to a number of larger experiments of scientific importance, further strengthening the solid
and broad technological base that enables Prysmian to develop special cables.

Data transmission cables

Prysmian continued to expand the GenSPEED® 10 category 6A cable during 2019. The new process technologies introduced
have significantly improved performance in the case of paradiaphonia (NeXT- Near-end Crosstalk). This has made it possible to
reduce scrap significantly and increase productivity. Prysmian also introduced a new version of the cable for riser applications
during the final quarter of 2019. In addition to this, the cable is now available with Reelex packaging that offers customers
lower installation costs. Development work is being carried out on the new generation of the cable, which will have an even
smaller diameter. This generation will become available in 2020 with less bulky packaging, thus lowering transportation costs

and facilitating installation due to the lower weight and narrower diameter of the cables.
