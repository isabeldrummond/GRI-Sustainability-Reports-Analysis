Prysmian Group I Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 27

 

ESG IS INTEGRAL TO THE GROUP STRATEGY

We strive to align the management objectives of the Group with the sustainability KPIs and, to this end, we
have adopted a scorecard that enables us to manage social, economic and environmental matters as a part of
our business activities. The Prysmian Group's scorecard comprises 14 objectives with a business impact. These
are clear and measurable objectives identified with reference to 3 parameters: the 17 Sustainable Development
Goals for 2030 (SDGs) defined by the United Nations, requests from major International Sustainability Indexes
and the needs and expectations of our stakeholders, which are mapped each year via the Group's stakeholder
engagement initiatives.

REMUNERATION POLICY ALIGNED WITH ESG CRITERIA

The incentive scheme for all managers within the Prysmian Group is linked to the achievement of objectives for
the improvement of our ESG parameters. The 2019 Remuneration Policy adopted by the Group includes asystem
of variable remuneration based partly on performance on sustainability matters and, in particular, on the posi-
tioning of the Group in the three main sustainability indexes - Dow Jones Sustainability Index, CDP Index, EcoVa-
dis Index - and partly on the progress made on implementing the action plans for three matters of importance
to the business: the level of gender diversity in management, the reduction of CO, emissions and occupational

health and safety.
