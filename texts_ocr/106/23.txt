The fingerprint of cables that provi-
des information in real time

PRY-ID is the intelligent, innovative solution
launched by Prysmian that provides real-
time access to key information about cables
and accessories: case type, length, source,
components connected. This represents a type of
“fingerprint” for cables, which translates into cost
savings and enhanced safety by making it easier
to locate cables and components reliably within
buildings

| Intelligent virtual assistant for ma-
naging drums and electrical cables

ALESEA is the new IoT solution that provides vir-
tual assistance in the management of drums: this
is the first innovation from Corporate Hangar, the
innovation hub of Prysmian. An intelligent device
is installed on the drum and cloud infrastructu-
re makes it possible to file and process the data,
accessible via an intuitive web platform. To date,
over 1,000 Alesea devices have been tested in 7
countries.

| FLEXRIBBON

FlexRibbon is the optical fibre cable with the lar-
gest number of fibres in the world: using extre-
mely flexible fibre ribbons, almost 7,000 fibres
can be fitted into a low-diameter cable. This ma-
kes it possible to insert the largest possible num-
ber of fibres into the space available, miniaturi-
sing the cable.

 

| The Leonardo da Vinci, the largest cable-laying ship in the world,

has alow environmental impact

 

Prysmian has begun construction of the Leonardo
da Vinci, the largest cable-laying ship in the world.
This vessel is designed to be the most efficient and
effective on the market, with increased capacity
and greater versatility for the implementation of
projects. The ship will be equipped with leading sy-
stems for reaching and holding position at sea, whi-
le its engines and propulsion systems have been
designed specifically to reduce the environmental
impact. The new vessel will be fully operational by
2Q 2021.
