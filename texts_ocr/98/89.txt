ORSERO

The most impacting energy consumption is related to the fuel consumption of the owned
naval fleet.

Emissions in the atmosphere

The emissions into the atmosphere of the Orsero Group, reported in this chapter, can be
traced mainly to:

¢ Direct emissions (Scope 1) deriving mainly from the energy consumption
of the “Cala Rossa” fleet and, to a lesser extent, from the use of refriger-
ant gases used to preserve the cold chain, from the use of energy carri-
ers in warehouses and other Group offices and from the use of ethylene

for product maturation.

¢ Indirect emissions from electricity consumption (Scope 2) deriving mainly from

the activities carried out in the warehouses where the Group operates.

COz2?3 direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect ones deriving from energy consumption
(Scope 2, calculated according to the market-based methodology) in 2018 have been
equal to 314,429 tons of CO2e”4.

23 The Group's direct and indirect atmospheric emissions were calculated in CO2, as the difference with respect
to the value calculated in CO2eq was considered not relevant for a correct representation of the Group's
actions.

24 The source of emission factors related to Scope 1 is: DEFRA, UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for
Company Reporting (2018); the source of emission factors related to electricity consumption (Scope 2) are
Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB), 2018 European Residual Mixes, (2018) and Terna, International Comparisons
(2016).
