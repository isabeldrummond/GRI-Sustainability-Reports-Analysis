ORSERO

The second largest category of reference, representing 23% of the Orsero Group's distri-
bution sector, is made up of all those fruit and vegetable products that come from over-
seas. Tropical fruit is a key player in the distribution operating segment: sourcing from
Costa Rica, Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador and Cameroon plays a fundamental role
in creating the value of the Orsero Group.

Fruit and vegetables grown on the Italian territory are also particularly appreciated by
the market and consumers: domestic products are distributed in a considerably lower
percentage (10%) but are becoming more important. Orsero supports local agriculture
and promotes the distribution of cultivated products on the Italian territory: in fact, there
are many contracts stipulated with local farmers and retailers. Italian fruit and vegetable
production also boasts a very wide range of varieties, depending on the seasonality and
region of origin, as well as excellent quality.

In addition to overseas and domestic production, the distribution of products grown in
Europe remains an important share, accounting for 20% of the volumes distributed by the
Group in 2019.

As has already been pointed out, one of the Group's greatest strengths is the fact that
most of the products marketed are available throughout the year: thanks to the Orsero
strategy of diversification of supply sources, it is also possible to deal with any shortages
or supply difficulties due to the seasonal nature of the products. By integrating different
supply chains, the constant availability of products is guaranteed, which, also thanks to
efficient storage and chain management, ensures that Orsero is always able to meet the
needs of customers and consumers.

Finally, the Orsero Group's distribution business operates differently depending on the
country of reference. In fact, the destination of the products direct to Large-Scale Distri-
bution (GDO) or alternatively to wholesalers and traditional markets - depends on the
characteristics of the local market: in particular, depending on whether there is a greater
or lesser penetration of the large-scale distribution network in the local area. In some
contexts, such as France or Portugal, Orsero products are mainly destined for supermar-
kets, while a smaller proportion is distributed to wholesalers or traditional markets. In other
countries, such as Spain and Greece, where the "modern" market has penetrated in a
less capillary way and the diffusion of traditional markets is still important, distribution sales
are mainly destined to wholesalers/traditional markets. In Italy, distribution sales are
equally divided between large-scale distribution/supermarkets and traditional wholesal-
ers/traditional markets.
