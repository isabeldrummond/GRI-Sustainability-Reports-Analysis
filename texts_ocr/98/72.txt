focus on:

The presence of Orsero at the Jova Beach Party

F.lli Orsero in summer 2019 participated as a sponsor at the Jova Beach Party, the event of
the year that was not just a concert, but a party, a traveling journey capable of revolution-
izing the Italian summer promoting the culture of respect for the environment, with an entire
project dedicated to waste recycling.

The brand accompanied all the dates of the tour with an iconic and fun fruit truck topped
by a giant pineapple of about 5 meters, and its new line of fruit already cut and ready to
taste sold in 100% recyclable paper cups.

With more than 8,000 kg of fruit sold, the partnership has been a great success both on the
field and in terms of online results: more than 20,000 fruit cups have been sold and almost 16
million views of the content dedicated to the public tour on F.lli Orsero social profiles.

F.lli Orsero fruit was also enjoyed backstage by Lorenzo Jovanotti and all the artists wno per-

formed during the tour.
