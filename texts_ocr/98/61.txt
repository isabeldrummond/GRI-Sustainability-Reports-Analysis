centers or more populated areas, so that the products are available for distribution
quickly, to respect the needs of the customers, in terms of product quality and timing.
The great strength of Orsero also lies in its storage capacity, and therefore in its ability and
expertise gained through years of experience in managing product arrival cycles. It is
essential - especially in the food sector - to have the ability to deal with any peaks in
demand and supply: given the seasonal nature of fruit and vegetable products, this be-
comes a fundamental condition for the success and growth of the Group.

Orders are managed through a precise programming that aims at maximum efficiency,
so that all products can then be appropriately selected, stored or processed. At each
arrival, the products are taken in charge by the specialized staff, who, depending on the
type, variety and destination, direct the load towards the appropriate warehouse area
for the completion of the marketing preliminary stages. In particular, the products can
be destined for maturation (which takes place in specially equipped plants and thanks
to a natural ripening process), storage or processing. Usually, bananas and exotic fruits
pass through the maturation process, while other products are stored, processed and
prepared for commercialization.

Most of the products, after being selected and checked, are in fact directed towards
the cold rooms: in the warehouses the cold chain is never interrupted, so that the quality
of the product is not damaged.

Some specific product categories, in particular bananas and, even if to a lesser extent,
avocado, pass through the maturation phase: these products are normally picked when
still unripe, so that during transport the quality is not affected. In the warehouses, the rip-
ening chambers are diversified and of different sizes in order to efficiently manage arrivals
and any peaks. The maturation phase is managed and organized by specialized staff,
who, in accordance with the customer's needs, and so that such demands can always
be satisfied, establish the permanence of the fruits within the maturation cell, which varies
from 4 to 6 days. The maturation process takes place thanks to the use of ethylene, a
hormone naturally produced from fruit.

Once the maturation is over, the products proceed, like the others, to the packaging
phase: according to the needs and preferences of the customer and so that it can be
transported safely and maintaining its quality. For some product categories, a processing
phase, through which fruit and vegetables are portioned and packaged, for example
with regard to the IV Line products, might also be planned.

Once the maturation, processing and packaging phases have been completed, the
products are ready to be marketed and distributed.
