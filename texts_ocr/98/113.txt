5. Understanding of the processes underlying the origination, recording and management of qualitative and
quantitative material information included in the NFS.

In particular, we carried out interviews and discussions with the management of Orsero S.p.A. and with
the employees of the subsidiary Cosiarma S.p.A., Simba S.p.A., Fruttital S.r.l. and Hermanos Fernandez
Lépez S.A. and we carried out limited documentary verifications, in order to gather information about
the processes and procedures which support the collection, aggregation, elaboration and transmittal of
non-financial data and information to the department responsible for the preparation of the NFS.

 

In addition, for material information, taking into consideration the Group’s activities and characteristics:
* at the parent company’s and subsidiaries’ level:

a) with regards to qualitative information included in the NFS, and specifically with reference to the
business management model, policies applied and main risks, we carried out interviews and
gathered supporting documentation in order to verify its consistency with the available
evidence;

b) with regards to quantitative information, we carried out both analytical procedures and limited
verifications in order to ensure, on a sample basis, the correct aggregation of data;

* for the following company and sites, Albenga headquarters for Orsero S.p.A. and Mercabarna
(Barcelona) site and warehouse for Hermanos Fernandez Lépez S.A., which we selected based on
their activities, their contribution to the performance indicators at the consolidated level and their
location, we carried out visits on site, during which we have met their management and have
gathered supporting documentation with reference to the correct application of procedures and
calculation methods used for the indicators.

Conclusion
Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of

the Orsero Group as of December 31, 2019 is not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with
articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI Standards.
