The Group collaborates with numerous charitable organizations, which, thanks to their
commitment, contribute to improving the well-being of the local community and the
most disadvantaged. The Orsero Group supports the community by promoting projects

and initiatives, especially at national level. The initiatives therefore differ according to the

For the promotion of a healthy lifestyle and a correct
diet, Orsero supports the organization "5 al dia" (Five a
day), which encourages the population to the
consumption of fruit and vegetables, especially among
children and young people. To support the "5 per day"
program, Orsero's facilities opened their doors: the
children were able to explore the warehouses and, at
the end of the day, each child was given a bag of fruit
and vegetable.
