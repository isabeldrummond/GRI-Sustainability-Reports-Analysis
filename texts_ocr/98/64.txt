Fruit maturation and the de-greening process

Not everyone knows that fruits and vegetables are still alive and breathe when we
put them in the shopping cart: the cell walls continue to breathe to keep vital func-
ions once cut. "Breathing" is influenced by a number of factors, such as tempera-
ure, light, humidity and others. In the transition to biological maturity the fruits un-
dergo a series of transformations: they gain weight, accumulate water and sugars.
n the final phase of maturation the skin changes color, causing the green - typical
of the still unripe fruit - to fade to give space to the underlying colors. The fruit then
begins to soften, becoming sugary and juicy.

he process of banana ripening, in some cases also known as de-greening, allows
he fruits, which were harvested at the time of maximum development, but imme-
diately before maturation starts and stored at a temperature of about 14° C, to
start the natural maturation process uniformly and under control.

n specific refrigerated (or thermoregulated)cells, the enzymatic biological pro-
cesses that transform complex sugars into simple sugars and which cause the de-
greening of the peel are activated and controlled.

he process of de-greening of fruit is implemented in the warehouses managed by
he Orsero Group by specialized personnel and is managed through the use of
advanced computerized systems, which monitor the process accurately, in addi-

 

ion to continuous and regular checks carried out by technical personnel.

Ethylene is a gas vegetable hormone
that is produced by plants: such a tiny
amount is needed for triggering the
ripeness of fruits. Once triggered the
products can be made in great quantity
