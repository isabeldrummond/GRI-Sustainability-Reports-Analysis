Orsero Group

Group Profile

Orsero Group is a synonym for Italian excellence in the world, a reality that finds its origins
in the 40s in the fertile fields of Savona. The history of Orsero is an Italian family story that
has stubbornly and successfully entered the international market of import and distribu-
tion of fruit and vegetables. Orsero is a leader in Italy and a major player in Mediterra-
nean Europe for the import and distribution of fruit and vegetables, thanks to the exper-
tise gained in over 70 years of activity. The Group moves and distributes, every year, more
than 7502 thousand tons of fruit and vegetables, constantly monitoring the quality and
freshness of the products. Orsero is a synonym for fruit and vegetable products of taste,
genuineness and integrity; an Italian excellence in the world, able to bring products from
every corner of the world to Southern Europe, in a very short time, thanks to an articulated
and efficient organization at all stages of the supply chain. Every year, about 15 million
boxes of fruit and vegetables reach the main markets and wholesalers throughout South-
ern Europe.

The Group is currently present in Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, Greece, Costa Rica, Co-
lombia and Mexico with about 1,500 employees working in the 25 warehouses, 22 ripen-
ing centers and 26 fruit and vegetable market stands where the Group operates.

There are 3 different operating sectors integrated and coordinated by the parent holding
company:

and vegetables from most countries around the world, at any time of the year, in the

erate in the markets of Mediterranean Europe (Italy, Spain, France, Porto-Gallo and
