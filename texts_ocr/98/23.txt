Organizational, Management and Control Model

To guarantee the conditions of fairness and transparency in the conduct of business ac-
tivities, the parent company Orsero S.p.A has adopted an “Organization, Management
and Control Model” in line with Legislative Decree 231/2001.

The adoption of the Model represents, together with adherence to the Code of Ethics, a
powerful awareness-raising tool for all Group44employees and those involved in the ac-
tivities, such as customers, suppliers and business partners. This Model also ensures that all
parties adopt, in performing their activities, correct and linear conduct, and that they
commit themselves, in an effective and targeted manner, to the prevention of the crimes
contemplated in Legislative Decree 231/2001.

In particular, the Model identifies, through a careful analysis and mapping of the risks
related to the business activity, the "areas of activity at risk", or those areas and corporate
functions potentially affected by the risk of committing crimes. The processes involved in
the possible commission of offenses are also identified.

Therefore, the Model proposes to adequately inform all those who operate in the name
and on behalf of the company with respect to these risks: the sharing and adoption of
the Model is therefore proposed as an awareness-raising tool, but, above alll, as a func-
tional mean of promoting a risk prevention and assessment system.

With this in mind, an internal control system was set up, as a process carried out by the
management and by the directors of the company areas, aimed at identifying the po-
tential risks, implementing adequate preventive procedures and ensuring the efficiency
and effectiveness of the business activity. In this way, it is possible to act promptly, even
as a preventive measure, by monitoring the areas of activity that are potentially at risk,
to prevent and oppose any illegal acts.

4 as at 31 December 2019, the Italian companies of the Group that have adopted the Organisational, Management and
Control Model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001 are as follows: Orsero S.p.A., Fruttital S.rl., Simba S.p.A., Orsero Servizi
S.r.l., Vado Container Services S.r.l., Cosiarma S.p.A., Fresco Ship's Agency and Forwarding S.r.l., Fruttital Firenze S.p.A., Galandi
