ORSERO

Logistics

The logistics phase of the Group is described in the chapter "Logistic import and effi-
ciency: our ships", where the methods and times for transporting the goods are reported
in greater detail. The management of further logistics flows is entirely entrusted to third-
party companies, which operate mainly by road. The logistics phase is an important part
of the Group's supply chain, as the safe and efficient transport of goods guarantees the
freshness and quality of the products. For this reason, the Group aims to optimize logistics
by entrusting to specialized and experienced companies the management of the trans-
ports arriving and leaving the buildings located throughout the territory.

Responsible packaging

In the warehouses managed by Orsero, recyclable materials are used and particular at-
tention is paid to the responsible management of materials. In the warehouses managed
by Orsero, more than 25 types of packaging are performed for 300 different product
references.

Product packaging, especially in the food sector, plays an important role, because it has
the task of protecting food, preserving it during its transport and guaranteeing its fresh-
ness and safe conservation.

Also from the consumers point of view, the attention to the use of responsible packaging
and, in general, to the use of recyclable materials is growing, as greater care and re-
sponsibility is required with respect to the issues of materials management, optimization
of the resources used and recyclability of packaging. In addition to the need to respond
to customer needs, the need to use materials suitable for contact with food should also
be considered.

The packaging used in the warehouses and in the distribution of Orsero products are
purchased for their totality by external suppliers, most of whom, due to consolidated pol-
icies, use recycled material.

For the brand we use more and more packs with high percentages of recycled and re-
cyclable material. In 2019 - where possible - we replaced non-recyclable polystyrene
packaging with paper packs.
