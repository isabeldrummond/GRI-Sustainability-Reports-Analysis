Training

The Group companies promote the Model and the knowledge of the related internal
protocols among all employees, who are required to know and comply with the content.
The provisions on administrative liability and on the offenses provided for by Legislative
Decree 231/2001, and, more specifically, the principles contained in the Model and in
the behavioral procedures are brought to the attention of all employees upon hiring and,
when necessary, in the event of significant changes.

Orsero S.p.A promotes knowledge and observance of the Model also among the finan-
cial commercial partners, consultants, collaborators, customers and suppliers. They are
provided with the appropriate information on the principles, policies and procedures that
the company has adopted.

One of the companies of the group, Bella Frutta S.A. has assigned, during the course of
2018, to legal experts the drafting of anti-corruption policies and procedures and the
training of management and employees of the Company. The policies were redrafted
during 2019 but training will none the less be provided throughout 2020.
