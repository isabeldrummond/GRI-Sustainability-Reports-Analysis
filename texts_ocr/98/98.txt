Added value distribution?°

The statement of distribution of directly attributed added value is based on a reclassifi-
cation of the income statement format of the Group's consolidated financial statements.
The economic value directly generated represents the economic wealth produced dur-
ing the year by the Group and the analysis of the economic value distributed makes it
possible to obtain an assessment of the economic and social impact created, measuring
the wealth created for the benefit of all stakeholders.

As shown in the chart below, the value directly generated by the Group for the year
under review in this report is distributed in various forms to the Group's various internal and
external stakeholders.
