The fruit pallets are placed in the maturation cell where there are some
probes that measure the temperature of the air and of the fruit inside the
pulp; the correct positioning of the pallets and a special system of inflat-
able cushions guarantees a forced air circulation inside the cell.

During the de-greening cycle the temperature is constantly controlled
and regulated by means of electrical resistances, between 16.5 and 18
°C, depending on the duration of the chosen maturation program.
Through the forced circulation system a modest amount of azotene is
introduced into the cell, a mixture composed of nitrogen and ethylene,
which remains in contact with the fruit for 24 hours in order to reach alll
the fruits and trigger the ripening process.

Once this phase is completed, a series of aeration cycles are started,
with the aim to continually replace the air inside of the cell which is
always kept at a controlled temperature.

At the end of the cycle described above, the computerized system,
through the signals received by the detection probes, returns the
bananas to the correct temperature conditions for marketing the
product of +13.5 and +14.5 °C . After a careful evaluation of the process
by the technical personnel, the ripening cells are emptied to start a new
cycle while the fruits are subjected to the following selection, packaging
and shipping activities after a further check of the coloring parameters
and consistency.
