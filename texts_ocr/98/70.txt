Responsible communication

For Orsero, being socially responsible also means being close
to the consumer at all times. It means having an open dia-
logue, which can support people in their choices, providing
useful information, advice and adequate and correct infor-
mation.

For these reasons, dialogue with stakeholders and especially with consumers is a funda-
mental value for Orsero. To ensure dialogue and listening, Orsero has developed numer-
ous communication channels, especially on its social media. The most used is certainly
the Facebook and Instagram pages, which collects all the most useful information, new
initiatives and articles of interest.

Orsero is committed to answer each client's questions, analyzing the request and re-
sponding appropriately and accurately, so that any doubt or curiosity about products
signed by Orsero can be answered. But above all, Orsero aims to guarantee a direct,
immediate and transparent dialogue. The questions on the official pages of Orsero are
numerous, mostly related to how to best taste the products. Also for this reason, a blog
was created in the institutional website of Fratelli Orsero, where articles, news and recipes
are periodically shared. On the blog it is possible to find all the information necessary to
better enjoy fruit, new recipes, and discover all the benefits and properties of Orsero
products.
