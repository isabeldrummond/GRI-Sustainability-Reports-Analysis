numerous controls in all phases of product management, re-

specting the highest international safety and health standards.

thanks to the selection of the best suppliers and the quality control of the products. In
addition to the possession of certifications by suppliers, in order to guarantee the best
quality standards and the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, it is essential that
each load is verified at the origin. The products are subsequently checked during the
logistic phase: at the beginning, during and at the end of the transport, the quality con-
trol personnel check their characteristics and state of preservation. In particular, with re-
gard to the products transported directly by the Group thanks to the Cale, the owned
ships, meticulous checks are carried out when the products are unloaded in the ports:
through random checks of the loads, the products are evaluated by the operators who
give them a score and check their features.

Furthermore, when the products arrive in the warehouse, a series of checks are immedi-
ately carried out by the staff in order to ensure high levels of safety and quality. The in-
spections include the verification of the correct application of the product and food
safety standards in every warehouse of the Group, in the storage warehouses and by the
third party suppliers. In 2019, Group-wise over 78thousands of quality controls daily, on all
product lots and incoming references’.

available methods. The scope of the information is limited to the European companies of the Orsero Group.

tied out by the quality staff. In addition to the controls indicated herein, further investigations are carried out on
the chemical properties of the products, selected on the basis of a sampling plan defined at the beginning of
