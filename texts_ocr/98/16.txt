Orsero story: from local family to global family

The story of Orsero is one of an Italian family, which has worked
every day for over three generations with care and passion to
deliver only the best products on the table of every family.

The first Orsero was founded in 1940 by Antonio Orsero: the family fruit distribution com-
pany, active on the Italian territory, was born in Savona. In 1961 the time came for an-
other Orsero’s generation, the one of Raffaello, who has the merit of expanding the busi-
ness activity of the fruit and vegetable trade.

During the 1970s, step by step, the company found a further driving force in the distribu-
tion and import of exotic fruits against the season; these are the years of the first great
achievements of Orsero: the company began to market exotic fruits and to distribute
them throughout the Mediterranean basin.

The 1980s are marked by corporate internationalization, achieved through a dense net-
work of investments that led the company to the acquisition of banana plantations in
Costa Rica and of several companies specialized in the maturation and distribution of
bananas in France. Reefer Terminal was born in the port of Savona-Vado, specialized in
the handling and storage of fresh products. Port logistics control is a fundamental step in
the Group's evolution process; the port facility allows the company to control more ef-
fectively the quality and freshness of the fruit, ensuring a high-profile product. The need
to guarantee a high quality product pushes the company to invest in the ship owning
sector and in refrigerated transport on rubber; the first naval fleet with a cooling system,
"Cala Bianche", was specifically build for the transport of fresh fruit and vegetables in the
hold.

The 90s are marked by the consolidation of the company on the international scene, with
further investments in the distribution sector in Italy, Portugal and Greece. Between 1999
and 2000, the second “Cala Rosse” naval fleet, composed of larger ships, was also
launched and currently is still in operation. In the first decade of the 2000s, the expansion
policy was carried out in Spain and Italy, thanks to the acquisition of shares in some com-
panies operating in the distribution sector. In 2012 the F.lli Orsero brand was launched, as
synonym of Extra Premium quality fruit. The brand, intended for the European market,
expresses the highest quality of the product thanks to the management and control of
the entire supply chain, and has become the spokesman of the love and passion of the
Orsero Group towards its products. In recent years, an organizational review and a rein-
forcement of the managerial structure have been carried out.
