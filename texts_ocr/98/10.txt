ORSERO

The widespread presence in the territory, with platforms specialized in the processing and
storage of fresh product, makes it possible to serve both traditional/traditional wholesal-
ers/markets and large-scale organized distribution (GDO), with different mixes in the var-
ious countries according to the greater or lesser incidence of GDO on these markets. On
a global level, the incidence of sales to large-scale distribution in 2019 was around 59%
of the aggregate value of sales by European distributors, due to a growth in sales to this
segment which affected all companies and which had the most significant progress in
Spain, where new distribution channels were activated with some of the major large-
scale distribution chains. There are framework agreements with large-scale retail chains,
which regulate the main specifications and characteristics of the product being deliv-
ered, while product volumes and prices are defined on a weekly basis, following market
dynamics. Suppliers, selected in some of the most important production areas in the
world, guarantee a complete range of products available 365 days a year.

The import and marketing (Import & Shipping) of bananas and pineapples is one of the
main activities of the Group as a whole, considering both the great success that these
products have in the European market and the fact, not negligible from the point of view
of the stability of the operating cycle, of their availability throughout the year. The Group
supplies bananas and pineapples through long-term relationships with the most im-
portant suppliers based in Central America, the Canary Islands and, to a lesser extent,
Africa. Bananas and pineapples are marketed under the 'F.lli Orsero" and "Simba" brands,
in addition to numerous private labels. The maritime transport of bananas and pineap-
ples produced in Central America is carried out mainly by owned ships, the four reefer
units "Cala Rosse" that connect Central America with the Mediterranean, ensuring the
timely arrival of fresh fruit on European markets every seventh year.

The Services sector includes the activities relating to the Holding Company as well as the
provision of those services in the customs, container maintenance and IT sectors carried
out by some minor companies.

Growing, aiming at goals that seem unattainable and bringing
the world closer to grow together with suppliers and customers.

The mission of Orsero summarizes the values and the strategy that direct the corporate
journey and the Group's way of doing business day after day. The keystone of Orsero's
great success lies in the professional and personal relationships built and consolidated
over time, which make suppliers and customers real strategic partners.
