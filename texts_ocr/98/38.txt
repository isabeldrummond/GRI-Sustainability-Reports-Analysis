Last year, the Group purchased about 60 thousand tons of pineapple. Pineapple is a very successful
product and is the protagonist of Fratelli Orsero's Extra Premium line. In 2019, sales of pineapple in the
Distribution sector accounted for 4% of the Group's total.

In addition to the important sales numbers of the two fruits that are the leading products of the Orsero
line, it is also essential to underline their strategic importance. In fact, bananas and pineapples are
both available throughout the year: this brings important advantages both from an industrial and
commercial point of view. On one hand, this allows the Group and the companies that manage the
supply chain of these products to use the installed capacity - both in terms of maturity cells, and in
terms of pending personnel - efficiently and continuously throughout the year; on the other hand,
from a commercial perspective, this allows the Group to record constant sales for these product lines.
It is therefore evident that bananas and pineapples play an important strategic component in the
fruit and vegetable market, commonly characterized by the important seasonality of the products
and therefore more subject to volatility.

Exotic fruit is also a very successful product category: in 2019, the Orsero Group purchased over 50
thousand tons of exotic fruit, including over 33 thousand tons of avocados. In addition to these prod-
ucts, there are many exotic fruits marketed by the Orsero Group, including coconut, manioc, passion
fruit, plane tree and many others.

The growth of the Fresh cut market should be highlighted, with revenues amounting to approximately
9 million euros and representing 1% of sales in the distribution sector.
