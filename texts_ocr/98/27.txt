Strategic and operational risks

Risk connected to the price trend of raw material, procurement and relation-

 

ships with suppliers. The activities of the Orsero Group, represented by the import
and distribution of fruit and vegetable products, are strongly dependent on the
supply of certain products such as bananas, pineapples or avocados. and to
the fluctuation of the relative purchase prices, especially in consideration of the
availability of the products, and of the risks linked to the absence of formalised,
albeit long-term, relationships with most of its furnaces. There is also the risk that
the Group may not be able to transfer any higher purchase prices of products
to sales prices in the markets where they are sold. The occurrence of such cir-
cumstances, considered to be of average probability, could have significant
effects on the Group's financial position. This risk is considered to be of medium
importance. The quality and quantity of the offer of such products, as well as
the availability and sustainability of the purchase price of goods marketed by
the Orsero Group, which are perishable by their nature, may be influenced by
factors that are difficult to predict or control. In particular, supply conditions are
extremely sensitive to the climate and weather factor (periods of drought or ex-
cessive rainfall, storms or hail on plantations), as well as to soil conditions or the
presence of weeds or pests, which determine the greater or lesser availability of
the products, and consequently, their purchasing price. The change in raw ma-
terial prices is generally managed through the price policy of the products sold.
In order to deal with all this, the Orsero Group implements a strategy of diversifi-
cation of its sources, both in terms of geographic areas of supply and suppliers,
in order to address and compensate any product shortages during the different
seasons (the so-called "campaigns") of products. For the Orsero Group, one of
the priorities has always been the care of the relationship with suppliers, with
many of which have been established relationships over time, thus ensuring the
constancy of the necessary supplies and a possible mediation of purchase
prices.

Risks connected to dependence on distribution channels.
The Orsero Group's turnover is significantly dependent on sales to both large-

 

scale retailers ("GDO") and traditional wholesalers. In particular, in 2019, the
Orsero Group's turnover from large-scale distribution accounted for approxi-
mately 59% (61% in 2018) of the Group's turnover in the distribution sector, or
even 51% of the Group's total consolidated turnover.

The Group is exposed to risks related to the possible interruption of relations with
its customers or to changes in such relations that are worse than those existing
