& BRS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019
ORSERO

Investor relations

Following the listing of the Orsero Group on the MTA market, STAR seed, organized
and managed by Borsa Italiana, which took place on December 23, 2019, the
figure of Investor Relator was officially confirmed as an obligatory requirement for
the applicable regulations. This figure was already present in the Group since the
beginning of trading of the Orsero share on the AIM Italia market, since it was not
mandatory for AIM companies, as it was considered fundamental to implement
the dialogue with shareholders and ensure complete and transparent disclosure
to investors. The Group, as further confirmation of the attention that this issue
holds, is also assisted by an external company for the support of institutional and
investor communication activities.

As in previous years, the usual activities of meeting and discussion with sharehold-
ers and investors were carried out in 2019 to foster relations with the market and
the widest possible communication and dissemination of information. These in-
cluded the conference calls held with investors to present the 2018 annual results
and the first six months of 2019, in March and September respectively, and the
numerous roadshows in some important European financial centres, meetings or
telephone conferences. In particular, the Group was present at some important
conferences dedicated to the meeting between listed companies and investors:
ESN Investor Conference Paris, April; AIM Conference Milan, May; ISMO Milan, Oc-
tober; AIM Conference London, October.

The Orsero Group has also undertaken to disseminate - initially on a voluntary basis
with regard to the period of listing on AIM Italia and subsequently in compliance
with the regulations applicable to companies listed on MTA, Star segment - the
press releases containing regulated information also in English and to disseminate
half-yearly and annual financial reports also translated into English.

Finally, the maintenance and continuous improvement of the corporate website,
available in both Italian and English, allows the Group to open up to foreign in-
vestors and guarantees complete and transparent communication and infor-
mation at all times. The Orsero share is also covered by 4 analysts, thus ensuring a
plurality of financial research that is higher than the average for comparable
companies.
