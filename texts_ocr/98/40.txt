ORSERO

Fratelli Orsero’s banana

Banana is among the oldest fruits of the planet: it is native to New Guinea, where it was born more
than 7,000 years ago. During the centuries this sweet fruit spread first in India, then in Africa and finally
in Central America. Following the routes of the great maritime trade, the banana went around the
world and conquered the tables of the Italian families.

Fratelli Orsero’s bananas are produced in the best plantations of Colombia, Costa Rica and Ecuador.
In these countries, Orsero has found the best soils, fertile and rich, perfect for the production of tasty
fruits.

Bananas, available 365 days a year, are the fruit of the banana tree, a huge plant up to 7 meters
tall. They are born upside down, one next to the other, in a large mass of fruit called “helmet”, which
can exceed one meter in length and contain more than 200 fruits. The "Cavendish" variety, queen of
the Italian tables thanks to its sweet pulp, is cultivated in Central America.

The majority of Fratelli Orsero bananas come from Colombia, Costa Rica and Ecuador: in these
countries, the environmental and climatic conditions allow an optimal cultivation and growth
of this fruit, so well-appreciated and spread all over the world.
