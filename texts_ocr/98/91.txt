Waste management

The Orsero Group pays the utmost attention to the issue of waste, which plays a funda-
mental role considering the sector in which the Group operates.

Most of the waste generated by the Group derives from food products: along the supply
chain, during transport as well as in the warehouse, fruit and vegetable products are
checked to verify their quality. Non-edible or unmarketable products are discarded and
destined for composting.

The data on Group waste reported below does not include the quantities relating to the
waste generated by the ships of the “Cala Rossa” fleet.

The trend with respect to the production of waste is increasing not only due to the ex-
pansion of the Group and its activities but also due to exceptional disposals during 2019.

26 The perimeter of the data does not include waste produced by Cosiarma S.p.A.'s "Cala Rossa" fleet.
