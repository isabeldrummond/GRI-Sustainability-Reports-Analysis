focus on:
F.lli Orsero and the path to improve
packaging sustainability

Since 2018, the F.lli Orsero brand has started a process to improve the sustainability
of the packaging used for its products.

In 2018, for the flagship products of the Maturi line at the right point (mango, pa-
paya and avocado), which need packaging in order to protect the fruit, a solution
was studied that combines the convenience of the packaged product with the
environmental impact of the bulk: the sticker for sale per piece.

In 2019 - where possible - plastic or polystyrene trays were converted into FSC-cer-
tified paper trays printed with vegetable-based inks.
