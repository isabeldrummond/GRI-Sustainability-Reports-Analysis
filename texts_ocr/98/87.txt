ORSERO

Environmental responsibility

The Orsero Group carefully monitors its environmental impacts,
so that a strategy can be implemented to minimize the use of re-
sources. Orsero promotes a business activity that respects the
environment and natural resources.

The main environmental impacts of Orsero refer to the energy consumption resulting from
the operations carried out inside the warehouses where the Group operates and the
environmental impact generated by the ships of Cosiarma's fleet. The environmental im-
pacts of the fruit and vegetable trade in the traditional market stands and in the Group's
commercial offices can be considered residual.

The Group also owns two small plantations, in the Canary Islands and Mexico, planted
respectively with bananas and avocados, through which Orsero aims to implement and
monitor the best agricultural practices in these areas. The quantities produced by these
plantations are residual and even in this case the environmental impacts have been
considered not relevant.

Any other limitation in the perimeter of the reported data is specified in the chapter.
