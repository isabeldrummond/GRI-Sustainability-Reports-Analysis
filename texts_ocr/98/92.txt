The above figures do not include the quantities of waste generated by the ships of the
"Cala Rossa" fleet since, due to the particular nature of the business, the data is collected
in volumetric units: during 2019 the fleet produced 1,173.64 cubic meters of wastes.

The use of water resources

Water consumption is largely attributable to the use for civil purposes in the warehouses

and offices of the Group and to the cleaning of warehouse work environments. In order

to minimize the use of the water resource, in some warehouses cooling systems with water

recirculation are installed (eg. evaporative towers).

The volumes of water taken by the vessels of the "Cale Rosse" fleet are then discharged
into the sea: these are used for the ballast, which is necessary for the stability of the ves-
sels. In this regard, it should be noted that as early as 2018, in compliance with the regu-
latory obligation for the year 2019, water treatment systems (Ballast Water Treatment Sys-
tem) are installed on the ships of the fleet for the purification of ballast water.

27 The data relating to water withdrawals carried out by the Group are partly the result of estimates made using

the best available methods.
