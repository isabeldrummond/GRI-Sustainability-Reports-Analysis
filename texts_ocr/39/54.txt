OUR ECO-SUSTAINABLE JOURNEY

Over the course of more than forty years of our existence, we have significantly improved our production

processes with regard to the eco-compatibility and sustainability of our practices. Among the main achievements
in the field of sustainability and safety we find:

- ISO 14001.

- Recognition by ASUR, INAIL and Confindustria for a safe working environment.

- Construction of a trigeneration plant, which contributes to greater energy efficiency.

- Introduction of a single water-based cleaning process, eliminating hazardous chemicals.

- Creation of the company policy, ensuring that every single product is free from carcinogenic, mutagenic and
teratogenic substances.

Closed-loop production system, constantly reusing water for cooling.
- Various initiatives and activities to support our employees and the community.

We are currently working on several projects with the aim of developing more sustainable soles, using, for
example, recycled materials. In addition, we want to increase the consistency of our practices in relation to

international standards. For over 4 years, we have been preparing the integrated report in accordance with the
GRI Standards.
