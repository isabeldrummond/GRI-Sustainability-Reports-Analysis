Deferred tax assets and liabilities
(Ref. art. 2427, first paragraph, no. 14, Civil Code)

Given that there is no deferred tax liability, it should be noted that:

- Deferred tax assets have been calculated according to the global allocation criterion, taking into account the
cumulative amount of all the temporary differences and the IRES and IRAP rates presumably in force in the
years in which these differences will be eliminated.

- Deferred tax assets have been recognized because there is a reasonable certainty that, in the years in which
the deductible temporary differences against which they were recognized will be reversed, taxable income
will not be less than the differences that will be reversed.

The evolution of deferred tax assets during the year was as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

Description Anticipated IRES_ Anticipated IRAP Total
Initial balance of taxes from previous years 473.850 5.994 479.844
Utilisation 2018 taxes from previous years (56.187) (56.187)
Deferred tax assets formed in 2018 (14.597) (14.597)
Rounding 1 1
Deferred tax assets at 31/12/2018 403.067 5.994 409.061

 

The algebraic sum of deferred tax assets formed in 2018 and the use of those formed in previous years has
been included, for the amount of € 74.784, in item 20 of the income statement as an increase in taxes for the
year. The final balance as at 31/12/2018 has been entered among the assets in the Financial Statements and
precisely under item C.II.5 ter "Deferred tax assets". The main temporary differences that led to the recognition
of deferred and prepaid taxes are shown in the following tables together with their effects.
