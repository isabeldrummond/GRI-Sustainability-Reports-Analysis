INVENTORIES

Inventories of raw materials,

auxiliaries and

finished products are recorded at the lower of
purchase or manufacturing cost and market value,
using the following valuation methods:

- Raw materials are valued at the weighted average
purchase cost for the year.

- Work in progress is valued on the basis of the
costs incurred during the year.

- Finished products are valued on the basis of the
relative cost of production.

Explanatory notes

- Sundry and consumable materials are valued at
purchase cost.

Given the trend in the relative prices, a small part
of the raw materials was valued at market value
at the balance sheet date, as it was lower than the
criterion of the "weighted average purchase cost
for the year" that we adopted.

This method of operation is prescribed by current
civil regulations and also complies with the
relevant tax regulations.
