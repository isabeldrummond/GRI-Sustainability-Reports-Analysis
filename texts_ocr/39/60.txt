We believe that all investments to improve safety in the workplace, from training courses to advanced safety
mechanisms and equipment, are essential. At least once a year, safety professionals (RSPP, ASPP, RLSA, the
competent doctor, the external consultant, the supervisors and the management) meet to analyse the risk
assessment document and the general trend of safety in the workplace. The company invests in updating its staff,
who are trained in the application of new production techniques in order to prevent possible risk situations. A
training and information policy is in place which takes place at the time of recruitment, at each change of job, at the
introduction of new chemical agents and plants. During the year, there was no damage to the environment and no
sanctions or penalties were imposed for environmental offences or damage. The company is equipped with an
occupational health and safety management system. The company signs every year a collective bargaining
agreement which includes all matters share and agrees with trade unions
