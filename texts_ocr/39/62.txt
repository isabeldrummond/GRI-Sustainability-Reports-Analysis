Year by year we strive for efficient use of energy. Although we do not yet use energy from renewable sources,
we optimise energy consumption through a tri-generator that produces its own energy. The plant is powered by
the methane we buy. In fact, part of the methane we buy is used for the trigenerator, which in turn produces
energy, while the rest of the methane is used for heating, which requires machinery and equipment. The thermal
energy produced by our tri-generator is also used for heating during the winter season. The heating is generated
by our heating system and is mainly used for production machinery. Office heating, on the other hand, comes
from heat pumps powered by electricity. To avoid gaps caused by the tri-generator, such as insufficient heating
of production systems, we have created a back-up line powered by diathermic oil and with a suitable heat
exchanger, which comes into operation when there is a need for heating and the tri-generation line fails. All the
electrical and thermal vectors made available by trigeneration are used. When they are not sufficient to meet
the demand from the systems, the thermal power plants and the withdrawal of electricity purchased externally
are automatically put into operation. The power plants minimize their weekend use thanks to a mechanism that
started four years ago.

The production of soles requires high energy consumption. The tri-generator has proven to be an optimal
solution for the efficient supply of hot and cold electricity on an annual basis. All these efforts show that, although
we are a company that needs a high amount of energy, we are able to follow environmental policies that make
our business sustainable. Our trigeneration plant has obtained the CAR certification issued by the Italian institute
GSE (which manages the national energy services).

Monthly we monitor the consumption of energy (electricity and natural gas), water (wells, aqueducts) and
other significant environmental indicators through an accurate data collection and calculation based on
invoices and meter readings. We use TEP as a unit of measurement because it allows us to homogenize MW.
and m3. In 2018 we were able to reduce the energy consumption compared to the previous year also
considering the increase in soles produced. The amount of electricity consumed consists of both the electricity
we buy and the electricity we produce internally.

The data relating to waste are calculated in accordance with Legislative Decree 152/2006, part III,
Environmental regulations.
