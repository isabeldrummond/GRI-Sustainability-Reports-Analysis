These are determined according to the criterion of the actual accrual period of the year. For those of multi-
year duration, the conditions that had determined their original recording were verified.

These measure income and expenses whose accrual is anticipated or postponed with respect to the cash
and/or documental event; they do not depend on the date of payment or collection of the related income
and expenses, common to two or more financial years and spread over time.

At the end of 2018, there were no accruals or deferrals with a duration of more than five years.
