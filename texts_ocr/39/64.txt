SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018

Waste

WASTE [303-2] [306-2] [306-4] [103-2]

The total amount of waste produced in 2018 compared to the total number of soles produced remained constant
compared to last year, as also shown by the indicator that evaluates hazardous waste.

The percentage of waste sent for recovery decreased compared to 2017 and has been decreasing in recent years.
In 2018, however, this figure was influenced by the extraordinary waste produced during the restructuring and
expansion activities, with equipment decommissioned and greater maintenance carried out.

The results of the 2018 and 2017 indices show a decrease in the production of waste per pair of soles compared
to 2016, when there was an increase in production characterised by an increase in the production of rubber soles,
with the relative waste, and an increase in the waste produced by extraordinary maintenance work and internal
cleaning of the departments that have been relocated and by restructuring activities underway. As far as
hazardous waste is concerned, the increase recorded in 2017, maintained in 2018, is justified by an intensification
of water spare parts for washing machines (CER 070601*) as it was necessary to use cleaner water in the closed
cycle for work in progress. The company reports every kind of hazardous waste transported, treated and the
methodologies adopted.
