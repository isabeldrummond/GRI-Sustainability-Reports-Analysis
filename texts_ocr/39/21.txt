CUSTOM ERS [102-2a] [102-6] [412-3]

The clientele is the lifeblood of the company, as they allows the work to continue in a profitable way and stimulates
us to always improve. This is why we try to best preserve existing customers but at the same time expand the horizons
towards new potential buyers. It is therefore very important to keep the quality level of the products high, so as to
represent a model in the production "Made in Italy". We operate in a "business-to-business" manner. To better
understand our customers’ needs, we regularly analyze the specific needs and current developments in our industry.
One of the typical characteristics of this market is concentration. In fact the number of our customers is around 1080
units, a much lower number as in a "business-to-customer" market. Even more relevant is the fact that the first five
customers make up 47.40% of the total turnover. The relationship between the supplying company and the client
tends to involve not only those in charge of the purchasing or sales function but also production, logistics, R&D,
administration.

Thanks to the better quality of management and customer relations we have also found a high degree of customer
loyalty. We have relationships with some of our Italian customers that have lasted for over 10 years. Our goal is to
provide our customers with the best possible service, regardless of size.

For this reason, in 2010 we decided to follow the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) management approach.
This allows you to coordinate new contacts, develop relationships with existing customers, learn about and monitor
purchasing behavior. In addition, CRM makes it possible to more effectively segment the customer base and
rationalize its management, reduce errors and the risk of decision-making activities.

As you can see in the chart below, we use a CRM program. The commercial area staff can access the program from
mobile devices at any time and place, performing remote access in total safety for the company network and its data.
Information and data relating to a customer can be updated in real time and visible from all accounts. The main
advantages emerged are: leaner and faster processes, greater use and sharing of information and a reduction in
management costs.

Customers receive new information through our product cards. They contain detailed information on the products we
offer and are intended to help customers with the purchase decision. To maintain our high standards, we carry out
quality tests at the end of the production process. We have received very positive feedback from our customers so far
and do everything we can to keep our customers satisfied.

Our high level standby customers propose the company to sign commercial agreement wich include significant and
relevant items related to ethics, human rights and sustainability.
