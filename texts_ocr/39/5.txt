Our company was founded in 1976 and is one of the most important Italian companies for the production
of soles. We have witnessed for over forty years a constant growth, favored, in addition to the area in
which we find ourselves, by the tenacity of our entrepreneurs, very serious people, completely dedicated
to work, without distractions and able to compete with the whole world. Our company and our
administrator have characterized:

- The essence of the city's industrial culture,

- diplomacy applied day by day,

- the philosophy of profit,

- reinvested in research, development and innovation, terms that have become fashionable over time, but
in via Pertini, the headquarters of our company, used and applied from the beginning.

Our great success has been achieved thanks to our workforce, completely dedicated to achieving
corporate goals. The atmosphere in the work stimulates employees to feel like an integral part of the
project with a single goal, to be the leader in the sector.

What is most important to us is human relationships. This implies absolute respect for those who
contribute to the success of the company, the origin or gender of our employees do not make the
difference. We treat our people properly and respect contracts and agreements. This creates a work
environment in which interpersonal relationships and friendships thrive vigorously.
