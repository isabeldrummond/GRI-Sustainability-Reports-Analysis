OUR BRANDS [0221 [203-2]

 

The EUROSUOLE QUALITY brand represents, as the name itself states, the quality that we ensure both
through our soles and in our way of working. We deeply believe that quality wins over any other strategy.
We try to offer quality in every aspect of our work: from the moment we answer the phone, to the research
carried out in our laboratory up to the relationship with our customers.

Gomma Leggera Gurosuole

GLE (LIGHT RUBBER EUROSUOLE) The GLE brand represents our lightweight vulcanized foam soles. With
GLE soles we have been able to overcome the numerous limits of vulcanized foam rubber related to the
dimensional control of the manufactured product obtainable through the molding process. The
technology used for this type of sole is decidedly innovative in the field of the production of soles: first of
all it gives the possibility to create shapes of every type and to reduce the rejects, and consequently, the
times and the costs, moreover, it assures maximum lightness to the sole.

Wellfst

The walking pleasure

The WELLFEET brand represents our soles made of materials resistant to hydrolysis and various climatic
conditions, including high humidity. They are manufactured from a special polyurethane compound. Its
technical qualities and, at the same time, its young and comfortable style allow us to satisfy even the most
demanding customers. Wellfeet is a sole designed for the total well-being of the foot, a part of the body
stressed every day. "The walking pleasure", the brand's slogan, communicates the effect of soft foot
massage. Wellfeet soles are 100% Made in Italy.

In 2015, we filed an application for tax relief for the Wellfeet brand. This support is provided by the Patent
Box, the Ministerial Decree of July 30, 2015, which allows for reduced taxation on income from intangible
assets (including trademarks, patents and intellectual property). As provided for by the Decree, we have
started the application for access to the prior agreement procedure (of "ruling") for the facilitated regime
referred to in art. 1, paragraphs 37 to 45, of Law 190/2014, and is waiting for the conclusion of the prior
agreement with the Revenue Agency. During 2018 we had several meetings with the agency and by the end
of 2018 the agreement will be defined.
