ENVIRONMENT "202!

"Eurosuole S.p.A. believes that the environment is a central objective not only of economic and social policies
but also of industrial activities, in the conviction that the commitment to sustainable development, as well as
a value of business ethics, is also an important variable in the company's management strategy. The
continuous improvement of its environmental performance is therefore consistently pursued by Eurosuole as
an essential condition for us to speak of "sustainable development".

In full compliance with current national and EU laws and environmental regulations, Eurosuole is committed
to carrying out its sole production activities responsibly.

At any time, the methods adopted to carry out this activity guarantee the safety and health of employees and
the population and ensure that any negative effect on the environment is reduced to a minimum. This, in our
reality, means producing in the best way, always with the aim of saving energy and natural resources. It also
means analysing each stage of the production process in the search for increasingly eco-compatible
alternatives with the essential objective of creating products that have added value for the customer in terms
of quality, durability and composition. Eurosuole is committed to reducing all types of pollution, trying to apply
strategies that reduce the environmental risks due to its activities and adopting a system of prevention and
protection through effective emergency plans.

The above words are a summary of our environmental policy.

Our environmental policy is fundamental to defining and achieving our objectives, as well as safeguarding the
local community and preserving the environment. For this reason, we promote its dissemination among our
Suppliers, customers and other stakeholders. Contractors working on the site on behalf of Eurosuole S.p.A. are
required to apply environmental standards in accordance with our environmental policy. In selecting suppliers,
preference will also be given to those who operate under an environmental management system.

The correct management of the above mentioned environmental issues is considered a fundamental factor for
the development of the company and Eurosuole considers environmental certification the essential expression
of the validity of an organised, structured and systematic Environmental Management System. The EMS is a
fundamental tool for defining and achieving the company's objectives and represents a guarantee for the
population living near our plants, for the surrounding area and, more generally, for the entire ecosystem.

For several years we have kept a "Register of Environmental Aspects and Impacts", a document that we update
whenever significant changes occur that affect the environment and that highlights year by year
improvements in sustainability.

We have also developed a "Register of Environmental Non-Compliances and Emergencies" which we update
each time a non-compliance occurs. This is an evaluation tool and an opportunity for continuous improvement
for the company.
