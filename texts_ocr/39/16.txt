2018 was a year of great importance for Eurosuole S.p.a. with significantly improved
economic and qualitative results and a sustainability plan that is increasingly integrated into
our corporate strategy.

In 2018 we committed ourselves to respecting the commitments made, trying to better satisfy our
stakeholders; we have tried to give life to a development able to satisfy the needs of the present
generations without compromising the ability of future generations to reach the same goal.

Our way of working and the choices we make are guided by the responsibility we feel for all those who
have a direct or indirect interest in the effects of the business activity and therefore towards those with
whom Eurosuole maintains relationships.

The will of the company and its managers is to create a process in which the exploitation of resources, the
direction of investments and the orientation of technological development increase the present and
future potential, for the satisfaction of human aspirations and needs. This is a moral responsibility, even
before being legal, towards all those who have a direct or indirect interest in the effects of the business
activity and therefore towards those with whom it has a relationship: from customers / consumers to
future generations, from suppliers to employees, from citizens to shareholders, from creditors to control
authorities.

Precisely for this reason a specific messaging system has been created, which allows you to communicate
immediately with all interested parties. In achieving the objective in question, the role of the Internet site
is central, through which the public is kept constantly updated by means of the special "News" section.
The same news are also visible on our Facebook page.
