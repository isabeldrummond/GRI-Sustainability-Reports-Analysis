Evaluation criteria '9%-5é! [192-11]

( Article 2427, first paragraph, no. 1, of the Italian Civil Code and accounting principle OIC 12)

The criteria used in the preparation of the financial statements as at 31/12/2018 do not differ from those
used for the preparation of the financial statements of the previous year, in particular in the valuations and
continuity of the same principles.

The items in the financial statements have been valued in accordance with the general criteria of prudence
and accrual, on a going concern basis and taking into account the economic function of the asset or liability
considered.

The application of the principle of prudence has led to the individual valuation of the elements making up the
individual items or items of assets or liabilities, in order to avoid compensation between losses that should
have been recognised and profits not to be recognised because they were not realised.

In accordance with the accrual principle, the effect of transactions and other events has been recorded in the
accounts and attributed to the year to which the transactions and events refer, and not to the year in which
the related cash movements take place (receipts and payments).

The continuity of application of the valuation criteria over time is a necessary element for the comparability
of the financial statements in the various years.

The valuation was carried out taking into account the economic function of the asset or liability element
considered, which expresses the principle of the prevalence of substance over form - mandatory where not
expressly in conflict with other specific regulations on the financial statements - allowing the representation
of transactions according to the economic reality underlying the formal aspects.
