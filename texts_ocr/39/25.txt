During the year, our company mainly completed the investments concerning the new mixing plant in the rubber
sector; the investment is technologically advanced and can count on the interconnection such that it has been
brought back into the investments called industry 4.0

To complete the increased production capacity, following the new rubber mixing plant, the Company completed the
purchase and testing of the latest generation of interconnected and functional injection moulding machines for the
same sector.

During the 2018 financial year, the company began work on the construction of the new office wing, which is
expected to be completed during the 2019 financial year.

In the current financial year, the company has planned to further strengthen the rubber sector by investing in
additional injection moulding machines and preforming machines with high technological requirements, so as to
minimise the waste of raw materials.

To try to better serve the high-end sector, the Company has planned further investments of a transversal nature in
the two sectors in which it operates, rubber and polyurethane, with the intention of establishing a true independent,
organised and highly specialised division that can contribute to guaranteeing the high quality standards required by
this type of clientele.

The investments will concern a machine for the production of polyurethane soles with high technological
characteristics, a mixer with smaller dimensions that can be more flexible and easily converted, guarantee smaller
quantities of orders and that can reduce the waste of raw materials to a minimum.

The most important infrastructural investments
for the three-year period 2017-2018-2019
concern the reconstruction of the demolished
shed and the putting into use of the industrial
