These are set aside to cover losses or debts that are certain or likely to exist, but whose amount or date of
occurrence could not be determined at the balance sheet date.

In the valuation of these provisions, the general criteria of prudence and accrual were respected and no general
risk provisions without economic justification were set up.

The item includes only the provision for customer indemnities potentially due to agents on the basis of existing
agency contracts. The increases relate to indemnities accrued during the year.

The provision for severance indemnities represents
the actual amount due to employees in accordance
with the law and current employment contracts,
taking into account all forms of remuneration of a
continuous nature.

It corresponds to the total of the individual
indemnities accrued at the balance sheet date, net of
advances paid and the amount allocated to the
Supplementary Pension Funds and the INPS Treasury
Fund, and is equal to the amount that would have
been payable to employees in the event of
termination of employment on that date.
