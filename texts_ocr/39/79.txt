Information unavailable
At this time, the company does not have any human rights policies.

With reference to the respect and protection of human rights, a subject considered material by
Legislative Decree 254/2016, the Company refers to two main sources: the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, approved by the United Nations Assembly in 1948 and the corporate Code of Ethics
(which will be implemented in line with D.Lgs. 231) and which will take up the issues most directly
related to the business activity. These are protected rights in all countries where advanced labor
legislation is applied and in which a model of modern well-being is developed, as happens in
European countries where Eurosuole operates. Even though our company has reasonably assessed
that it is not exposed to risks deriving from the lack of respect for human rights, we are in any case
developing and implementing a specific policy in this regard, considering that the scrupulous
application of the legislation in force and the activity exercised by the control management and are
sufficient to face any risks deriving from this area; the company will have this information in the next
reporting period.
