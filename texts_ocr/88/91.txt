are responsible within the Mediaset Group for
the dissemination and compliance with
legislation for the protection of minors.

From the date of signing the Self-Regulation
Code Concerning Television and Minors
(November 2002), the Mediaset Group has
always participated via its own
representative (as Vice Chairman) to help the
Committee implement the Code.

This year, the Committee instituted 9 cases
Mediaset
programmes. In two of these cases,

of proceedings against

determining violations of the Code: one

 

episode of Verissimo (interview with F.
Corona) and one episode of Pomeriggio
Cinque, in which certain content connected
with the sexual sphere was challenged.
(Another case of proceedings against
Pomeriggio Cinque, pending in 2019, was
closed in recognition of the violation in
January 2020.)

In Italy, Mediaset has also been part of the
technical working party that drafted the new
Self-Regulation Code for Media and Minors,
which aims to reformulate requests to
safeguard minors in the complex reality of

current mass media.

In March 2019, the proposal to revise the
Code was submitted to the Italian Ministry of
Economic Development, to initiate the
procedure envisaged in Article 34 paragraph
6 of Legislative Decree No. 177/2005 as
amended.

In anticipation of definitive approval of the
text, Mediaset has promoted exchange with
other Broadcasters that aims to find common
ground with a view to defining television
content classification criteria.

Also in 2019, Mediaset took part in the
technical discussions on the “classification of
audiovisual works for the web and video
games” arranged by Agcom within the co-
regulation monitoring body, and_ in
approving the definitive guidelines.

The Regulation on classifying audiovisual
works for the web and video games applies
to audiovisual works primarily intended for
distribution on electronic communication
services or networks.

This new classification system is currently in
the process of being adopted (The

Regulation is to be adopted by February
2020).

In 2019, Agcom did not initiate any
proceedings concerning the protection of
minors according to Article 34 of the
Audiovisual Media Services Directive.

In April 2019, the penalties imposed by
Agcom in 2019 for the transmission of
content unsuited to an audience of minors
during certain episodes of Grande Fratello 15
were contested at the Lazio Regional
Administrative Court.

In addition to the general principles, Mediaset
and the Italian subsidiaries within the Group
Code of Ethics (see also paragraph 1.3 and
3.2) have also adopted a provision explicitly
on the protection of minors.

Then there is a specific procedure, applicable
to the company R.T.I., the O.G. "Preliminary
checks for the issue and publication of
content”, aimed at preventing the
dissemination of images not suitable for

minors.

Lastly, the Group has confirmed __ its
commitment to make the web a safer place
for minors, also at European level. The
