channels, but also for the world of
infotainment. These products also fall under
the Videonews agency.

This structure of the Information Area allows
for a continual and necessary care in the
research and development of a news story.
This is guaranteed by verification of reliable
and true sources while constantly keeping an
eye on contemporary events, all in order to
guarantee the audience a useful and up-to-
date service.

To this end, Mediaset as a company
encourages the fight against the
phenomenon of fake news and celebrates
International Fact-Checking Day, which was
held on 2 April in 2019.

The creation of the services follows all the
regulations in the area of occupational health
and safety. This is first and foremost to
guarantee the safety of all employees and
collaborators of the Mediaset Group, and in
the specific case of news, to ensure current,
true and complete information.

Specifically, the field reporters in war zones
or areas of high risk are guaranteed
modulated integrative coverage based on

the specific characteristics of the mission.
These needs are monitored through a
constant dialogue with the public institutions
set in place in different countries (or bodies
associated to them) that may channel and
provide the information needed to fully
guarantee the safety of the field reporters.

By striving for an objective and effective
debate on the arguments addressed in the
different TV programmes, there is an attempt
to develop a _ settlement that may be
representative of freedom of expression (in
any case guaranteed by the professionalism
of the Editors of agencies, who have a trust
relationship with the Broadcaster), of the
plurality of voices and the completeness of
he news. To pursue these objectives and
improve the qualitative performance of the
products, it proved fundamental to
implement a convergence between
elevision and the different online media.

The agency editors have a function of
coordination, but with absolute respect for
he freedom and autonomy of the individual
broadcasts, written, conducted and
organised by independent and autonomous
writing and editorial working groups. The

 

broadcasts deal with current events, but

always with attention, which is also ensured
by the coordination of the editors, to the
following: issues of social inclusion of the
most vulnerable (at the centre of public, and
televisual, debate as never before),
protecting the environment, the risks of
climate change and the opportunities offered
by a transition to a green economy.

Plus, some programmes like Quarto Grado,
Mattino 5 or Pomeriggio 5 perform an
ongoing support activity for social and
awareness campaigns (for example, against
the abuse of women or against fraud
perpetrated against society’s more
vulnerable categories like the elderly or the
disabled). In particular, the show Quarto
Grado is capable of channelling important
and necessary messages for the
development of legal investigations. All these
activities have led to active audience
participation, at the same time
demonstrating a broad consensus and a

growing awareness of these topics.

In 2019, collaboration with the European
Commission was renewed and gave rise to a
series of evening programmes entitled
“Giovane Europa”, broadcast on the
TGCOM24 channel. The rights for the format
