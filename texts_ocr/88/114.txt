All Mediaset Group companies have defined
various corporate welfare systems in line
with the policies on human resources that
have always put people at the centre of the
corporate system.

Services and agreements

For over ten years the Mediacenter has been
active at the Milan and Rome offices, the
result of an important project aimed at
creating an optimal context to facilitate the
best balance between professional and
personal life. In particular, this is an area on
company premises that includes a series of
useful and concrete services for improving
the quality of life of those working for the
Group.

With an area of 3,000 square metres,
Mediacenter is considered one of the most
useful and welcoming welfare stores in Italy.
The services offered, managed by external
operators selected for their specific
experience in the areas of reference, concern
personal care and activities necessary for
family management:

e medical centre, which provides the
medical services of specialists from the
San Raffaele Hospital to employees free

e fitness centre;

e mini market;

e laundry/tailoring repair services;
e bank;

e post office;

e bookshop;

e travel agency;

e parapharmacy;

As well as this physical presence there is also
a website offering up-to-date details of
various deals negotiated by the company for
its staff - with banks, insurance companies
and over a hundred retailers active online or
near the Mediaset Group’s main offices.

The Group has also been working for many
years, together with local public bodies, to
offer its employees transport and mobility
services through company shuttle buses that
connect the Group's offices throughout the
day (including public holidays for production
centres) to the main nearby underground
and/or railway stations. The service is the
result of a detailed analysis of the home and
work journeys of all Group personnel of the
Milan and Rome offices, implemented in
collaboration with the Department of
Architecture and Planning (DIAP) of the
Politecnico di Milano, aimed at optimising
transport service routes and times and
limiting personal inconvenience connected
with reaching the workplace, both in terms of
time optimisation and stress accumulation.
The Group has put in place agreements with
public and private entities for the use of
parking spaces during working hours and has
stipulated framework agreements with local
public transport for discounted season
tickets for employees with debit to the
payroll.

In 2012, a company Campus was also set up

 

at the Cologno site with specific architectural
features aimed at connecting all the buildings
and production sites of the Group's
