decrease compared to 2018, demonstrating
the generous commitment and initiatives to
protect the environment promoted during
the year.

In reference to the sustainable management
of greenhouse gas emissions, it should be
noted that the Mediaset Group Espafia
identifies, measures and manages _its
emissions and_ establishes appropriate
measures for their reduction. In addition to
quantifying the emissions generated, the
company also makes this information public,
which demonstrates its degree of awareness
and transparency in this sector. The
commitment of the Mediaset Group Espana
to transparency is reflected in its
participation in the Carbon Disclosure
Project (CDP) initiative since 2009, with
which the Group agrees to publicise its
objectives and the methods implemented to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Furthermore, it should be noted that in order
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much
as possible and raise awareness among its
employees, the Mediaset Group offers its
staff a shuttle service linking the company's
premises with metro stations over a wide

range of hours in order to encourage greater
use of public transport.

In this context, we would highlight the fact
that the car fleet owned by Mediaset Espafha
includes 4 diesel cars for transport with
driver, 1 minibus for transporting employees
and a fleet of cars for long-term hire, used
exclusively by the group's senior managers,
comprising 52 diesel cars, 11 petrol, 3 hybrid
and one electric.
