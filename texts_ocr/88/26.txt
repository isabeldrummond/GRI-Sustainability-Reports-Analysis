1.4 LOOKING TO THE FUTURE:
MEDIASET FOR THE
COMING GENERATION

Throughout its history, the Mediaset Group
has always placed the coming generation at
the centre of its broadcasting projects and
internal policies, as well as the services
provided to the public and communities in

the areas where the Group is based.

In Italy, while managing to involve audiences
from all age groups, the Group has always
paid particular attention to young people,

through the planning of its programme
schedules and the selection of programmes
capable of responding to the demands of the
coming generation (see Chapter 4
"Effectiveness and sustainability of the

broadcasting and commercial offering”).

Canale 5 and its 17.7% share in the prime time
slot is the leading network in Italy for young
people between 15 and 34, and also for
women aged 15-44 with a 19.8% share. The
Italia 2 channel is the most popular with men
in the 15-34 age group, while Canale 20
(10.4% share) and Italia 1 (9.6% share) are in
third and fourth place. Interesting data can
also be found on young women Cin the 15-44
age group) for Cartoonito (25.8% share,
above all mothers with children) and La5S
(share of 20.2%), in first and second place in
Italy respectively.

Moving on to the programmes, the greatest
coverage for the youth target is offered in
particular by products on Canale 5, such as
Amici di Maria de Filippi (30.0% for young
people between 15 and 34 and 39.7% for
women between 20 and 24), the series Rosy
Abate (25.4% for the 15-34 group and 37.5%

for women between 20 and 24), Striscia la
Notizia (21.4% share for the 15-34 group in
the spring and 24.8% for men between 20
and 24). UEFA Champions League matches
are also very popular with men aged 15-19
(31.3% share in the autumn).

Italia 1 confirms its youth profile with fixtures
including Le lene (22% share for the 15-34
age group in the autumn, and 23.2% share for
men in the 25-34 age group and 26.1% share
for women between 25 and 34), the Colorado
comedy show (12.2% share for the 15-34 age
group) and episodes of The Simpsons (19.6%
share for the 15-34 age group and 25.4%
share for men aged 25-34 in the autumn).

A specific area of the company also monitors

devices, mobile and wearable devices,
tablets, smart TVs, etc.) and promoting
