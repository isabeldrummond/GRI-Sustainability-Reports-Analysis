Remuneration policies

In Mediaset, the remuneration levels of
employees are determined through an
assessment carried out by the Human
Resources Department and by the Business
Managers who, with the aim of ensuring the
competitiveness of internal remuneration
levels with respect to market benchmarks,
take into account the area of responsibility,
the task performed and the principles of
internal equity, irrespective of the sex of
employees, as well as the need to maintain a
level of attractiveness and retention for key
resources. To this end, depending on the role,
all modern remuneration instruments can be
adopted to supplement fixed remuneration,
such as: non-competition agreements, short
and long-term variable incentives, as well as
the welfare and benefit system that Group
employees enjoy.?” To support the
assessment of equity and the
competitiveness of remuneration packages,
Mediaset uses remuneration survey and
benchmark tools provided by _ leading
specialist consultancy companies.
