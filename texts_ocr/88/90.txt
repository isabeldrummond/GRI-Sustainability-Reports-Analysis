4.3. PROTECTION OF
MINORS

The Mediaset Group has always been
attentive to the protection of minors2°. For
this purpose, the company continuously
assesses transmissions and pays close
attention to the impact that these can have
during a child’s developmental years.

Below are a few of the commitments that the
Mediaset Group has undertaken to protect

minors:

e compliance with all applicable
regulations, including the Self-Regulation
Code Concerning Television and Minors
signed in November 2002, which commits
the Group's networks to the monitoring of
programmes offered to make sure it
observes the constraints in place to
protect young viewers. Through the
application of art. 34 of the Audiovisual
Media Services Directive, the Mediaset
Group has implemented a series of
organisational processes aimed at
assessing, identifying and adequately

indicating any programmes “that may
damage the physical, mental or moral
development of minors”, providing users
with detailed information;

notification of the nature and contents of
the transmission, linear and non-linear,
free of charge and pay per view, using
coloured dots at the beginning of each
fiction programme (film, series, TV movie,
etc.) and after each advertising break
(green dot: suitable for everyone; yellow
dot: recommended for children
accompanied by an adult; flashing red
dot: recommended for adults; fixed red
dot: harmful for minors or prohibited for
children under 14). Further information on
the programmes - useful for directing
users’ choices also in relation to the
protection of minors - is provided through
information tools accompanying the
content (e.g. EPG for digital terrestrial,
program information on the web and
apps);

e the offering dedicated specifically to
minors, thanks to 24-hour programming
of the three free-to-air channels Boing
(from 2004), Cartoonito (from 2011) and
Boing Plus (from July 2019).

The Mediaset Group is also committed to
promoting responsible TV consumption by
users, planning periodic campaigns on the
use of parental control, in which the viewer is
reminded of the possibility of activating the
blocking device through the decoder
settings to prevent the viewing of V.M.14
content potentially harmful to minors (the
latest was broadcast on all networks from
September 2018 to the start of 2019).

There is also a link that takes users straight to
the parental control feature - and to the
Committee for the Application of the Media
and Minors Code web pages - available to
users on the Mediaset Group website
(www.mediasetplay.it).

20 The Group's Code of Ethics is implemented by all Group companies except for the Mediaset Group in Spain, which operates its own code based on the parent Company's. The new Code of Ethics adopted by Mediaset S.p.A.
and its subsidiaries in 2019 retains a specific article (Article 8 "Integrity and protection of the person”) with provisions dedicated to protecting minors. It states: “The Mediaset Group rejects child labour and assigns primary
importance to protecting minors and suppressing their exploitation in any form whatsoever, including through electronic and computer systems.”
