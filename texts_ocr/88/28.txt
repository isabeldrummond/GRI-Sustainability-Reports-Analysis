Group's commitment to promoting Master's
and training courses should be stressed, for
young graduates interested in a career in the
world of television, marketing, e-trade
marketing, sales and digital communication,
in collaboration with major universities.

In Italy, we organise the Master's in
Journalism: this is the training course for
professional journalists, combining the
communications and information expertise
of IULM University and Mediaset. It is a
professional training course which is
recognised by the National Association of
Journalists as the equivalent of an
apprenticeship. In 2019, ten students on the
IULM Master's in Journalism were welcomed
to internships in Mediaset agencies (TV,
website and radio): 7 for 2 months and 3 for
3 months.

The Master's in Marketing, Digital
Communication and Sales Management,
established in 1988 by Publitalia’8O and now
in its 32nd edition, is also highly appreciated.
The Master's is a 13-month (lectures and
internship) postgraduate course with limited
admission aimed at graduates looking to a
professional future in the field of marketing,
trade marketing, sales and digital

communication. In 2019 the Master's offered
75 participants 153 course days for a total of
1,071 hours of training. At the end of this
internship period, all graduates were able to
find a stable job.

The training activities in Spain follow.

e Master's in audiovisual content creation
and management, launched in 2009 in
collaboration with the European
University of Madrid;

e  "Showrunner-aula_ di fiction” course

October 2019 in

collaboration with the Cinema and

launched in

Audiovisual School of Catalonia: a
workshop for young people intended to
create the formats of the future;

e Internship plan for students at the CES
School (image and sound _— studies
secondary school) to enable internships
within the Mediaset Group.

e Participation for the third year running at
the Meeting of Digital Talent -
Employment Fair in the Digital Era
(FEED), an event that brought together
thousands of young people looking for
their first work experience and which
aims to be a meeting point between the

coming generation and the world of
work.

The social communication campaigns that
have always distinguished the Mediaset
Group also continue. Awareness-raising
campaigns with TV and radio commercials
and digital and social media coverage aimed
at the community and youth issues in
particular (see Cap. 6 Community and
territory).

The “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” initiative
launched in 2019 is a part of this, a concrete
way of putting Mediaset's skills and
communicative power at the service of
society. The project began in September with
a campaign to raise awareness of school
leavers, with more than 750 TV broadcasts
on all of the Group's generalist and thematic
networks, 23 million web impressions,
reports on the subject by TG4, Studio Aperto
and an in-depth report on Tgcom24. A
documentary on the subject is also being
produced, by the InfinityLab team. A new
cross-media campaign from Mediaset called
“Pensa, prima di scrivere” to raise social
awareness in connection with the national
Anti-Bullying and Cyberbullying Day began
in the early months of 2020.
