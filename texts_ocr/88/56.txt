the Material Information management
process, in keeping with the Consob
guideline issued in October 2017, making
official the existing practice already
controlled by the relevant departments with

respect to the Material Information.

The Inside Information Procedure governs
the internal management and
communication to the public of inside
information concerning the parent company
and its subsidiaries, as well as the operation
of the “Register of persons with access to
inside information”. The Inside Information
Procedure is an essential component of the
Mediaset internal control and risk
management system and part of the rules
and prescriptions adopted by Mediaset in
accordance with Legislative Decree 231/01
for the purpose of preventing offences.

The Inside Information Procedure applies to
the directors, statutory auditors and
employees of the parent Company and
Subsidiaries as well as the external

persons/entities who act in the name of and
on behalf of the companies and subsidiaries -
with the exception of the listed subsidiary
Mediaset Espafia Comunicacién S.A. -
obliged to keep their own Insider Register, to
fulfil related requirements and to notify the
reference market.

Via its regulatory compliance department,
the Mediaset Group in Spain works to detect
and monitor potential conflicts of interest
between the company and its directors. This
matter is regulated by the Code of Ethics and
by the Group's internal code of conduct,
which both provide mechanisms _ for
identifying and resolving potential conflicts
of interest, thereby preventing conduct liable
to damage the company or its shareholders.

Under the regulations of the Board of

Directors, related-party transactions
between Mediaset Espafa and its directors
are subject to the authorisation of the Board

of Directors.

To avoid potential conflicts of interest in the
creation and dissemination of content, all
related commissions are subject to the
review, analysis and approval of the Group's
Acquisitions Committee.

"The parent company has carried out the assessment, gap analysis and material information flow mapping activities with the aim of identifying any opportunities to improve the inside information management process. The
analysis carried out identified effective control of the process of managing and communicating inside information, structured correctly and formalised in a process/procedure that clearly identifies roles and responsibilities, in

observance of the EU Regulation and Consob Issuers’ Regulation.
