The Mediaset Group’ in Spain_ is
scrupulously implementing the protection of
personal data and content in the sphere of
corporate management. The _ primary
instrument of implementation is the Code of
Ethics, which addresses aspects relating to

technology division will develop other
mechanisms determining the company's
conduct in regard to data security.

organisation. These procedures regulate
access to and the processing of personal
data in all departments, areas and
management units of companies belonging
to the Group, while also defining the security
measures to be applied during the
compilation of personal data to ensure the

operating procedures for managing
initiatives requiring the use of personal data:
identification and authentication, remote
access, access to applications and use of
personal data files. These procedures are
regularly updated to ensure their compliance

analysis in light of the General Data
Protection Regulation on the protection of
natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data, which came into
effect on 25 May 2018.

introduction of specific measures of a
technical, organisational and legal nature.

This protocol describes in detail the areas
affected by such rights, the channels through
which Group users can exercise them, the
procedure for replying to requests, special
cases for the exercise of rights, and
notification of users of the successful

outcome of their requests.

The Technology Division is in charge of
coordinating and managing the technical
aspects of information system security,
following the corporate security policy and
the internal action procedures, which apply
to all employees and managers.

As part of this policy, and as a method for
guaranteeing control over access to
corporate applications and services, a set of
guidelines addressing specific topics such as
the "Procedure for controlling access to
applications” and "Procedure for managing
media” has been prepared. The _ latter
procedure defines the cases in which
corporate data must be encrypted.

A procedure has also been developed for
