1.5 THE MEDIASET GROUP, ITS
BUSINESS CONTEXT, AND
SUSTAINABILITY

In a rapidly evolving national and
international context where new operators
and different platforms are emerging and
integrating, bringing big changes to offering
models and ways of accessing content, the
Mediaset Group - as Italy's leading private
television broadcaster - pursues its corporate
objectives with the major exogenous and
endogenous risk factors taken into account,
which can exert a significant influence on the
evolution and_ sustainability of its own
business model. Factors in this sustainability
include:

* Socio-demographic trends Crising
average age of traditional TV viewership)
and new ways of consuming content
among younger age groups (non-linear
consumption on new devices)

* New competitors (telecoms, global
internet players etc.) operating at every
link in the supply chain (content control,
distribution platforms, client databases
and advertising) and thereby depriving

traditional operators of their role as
intermediaries

* Regulatory changes on the national and
international levels (copyright protection,
concentration of advertising etc.),
changes. to _— allocations processes,
evolving distribution infrastructure (DTT,
broadband).

This scenario places the Group in a context
characterised by the growing maturity of the
leading markets and the rising cost of the
premium content offered by operators.

In response to this context, the Group's
strategy focuses on a media-company model
characterised by a strong local/national
quality, with a view to developing its product
and video distribution strategy in a multi-
device direction and the consequent
adaptation of its Compliance Programme
(processes, professional expertise and
technological innovation) as well as the
evaluation of any agreements and targeted
alliances on an international basis. This is the
context of the project, currently underway, to
create a new holding company through the
cross-border merger of Mediaset and
Mediaset Espafia into Mediaset Investment

N.V. (DutchCo), a wholly owned direct
subsidiary of Mediaset under Dutch law,
which will take the name "MFE -
MEDIAFOREUROPE N.V." and the acquisition
of a minority stake of 15.1% of the share
capital of the German broadcaster
ProSiebenSat.] Media SE.

As stated above, in the pursuit of its business
activities, the Group therefore maintains
relations with a multiplicity of stakeholders in
its efforts to protect their interests, while
setting itself the target of generating a
positive social impact in the territories where
it operates.

For these reasons, the Mediaset Group is
careful to fully comply with the applicable
laws and regulations in all the countries in
which it operates, undertaking to act in
accordance with the principles of loyalty,
propriety, responsibility and freedom of the
individual, respecting diversity and rejecting
discrimination in all its forms.

What this signifies in its business context is
the Group caring for its own employees and
cultivating their professional advancement,
safeguarding intellectual property rights and
