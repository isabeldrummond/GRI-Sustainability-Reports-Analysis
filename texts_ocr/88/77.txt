The distribution of the multimedia and
television content produced by Medset is
managed by a third-party company, as well
as through the Group’s internal channels,
through specific distribution licences that
satisfy the legal requirements (e.g. film
classification).

Medusa Film is in charge of the distribution
of (mainly Italian) cinematographic works.
The company produces and purchases films
exploiting the entire life cycle of the product:
from the programming in cinema releases to
the sale of television rights in all their various
forms.

Medusa’s line-up, constantly agreed upon
with Mediaset Group in order to meet
programming requirements, focuses on the
Italian product in the “comedy” genre. Actors
and directors like Paolo Genovese and
Checco Zalone - who in the past few years
have helped to redefine the contemporary
concept of Italian comedy - demonstrate the
extreme emphasis on a type of film that has
always shaped the history of our cinema.

2019 was also marked by films which can’t be
considered as representing the comedy
genre alone, however: dramas such as

Domani é un altro giorno, by Simone Spada
with Marco Giallini and Valerio Mastandrea;
mystery/thrillers like /nto the Labyrinth by
Donato Carrisi with Tony Servillo and Dustin
Hoffman; comedy/horrors such as Sono solo
fantasmi with Christian De Sica; these all
represent a constant search for new
inspiration, able to attract an increasingly
demanding audience.

The thread that runs through all of them
remains Medusa’s mission for Italian cinema,
which simultaneously means guaranteed
selection, production and distribution of the
best products, in an attempt to promote
national and local artistic and professional
excellence. In order to face up to the
competition of foreign products, this
commitment must always be_ ensured
according to top industry standards.

The value of the decisions taken was
demonstrated by the highest takings of the
year in the Italian film category: Once Upon a
Time in Bethlehem with Ficarra and Picone
(EUR 13.4 mil. in the year; 15.3 in total), which
marked the return of the famous Sicilian
comedy duo. Another great result, the
extent of which was fairly unpredictable, was
When Mom Is Away by Alessandro Genovesi,

with Fabio De Luigi (EUR 7.5 mil.), with the
third highest takings among international
films.

Medusa’s role and results are therefore highly
significant: again underscoring the correct
strategic positioning of the company, which
has always been a landmark in this nation's

cinema.

News and Sports

In 2019, Mediaset developed and
consolidated its integrated system model for
News and Sports across its networks and
multimedia platforms.

The system is based on several elements.
