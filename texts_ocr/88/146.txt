In 2019, 37 applications for authorisation
were made together with the same number
of assessments. These were joined by 9
inspections (post-activation checks
requested by the authority) and 20 cases of
ARPA monitoring (periodic checks in the
area).

The procedure adopted by the Group for the
radio station in order to monitor
electromagnetic pollution and safeguard the
community is divided into the following
activities:

e Execution of an Electromagnetic Impact
Analysis (EIA) for each plant it intends to
install ex novo or whose emission
characteristics are to be modified by
specialised third-party companies and
personnel in possession of the
qualifications required by — current
legislation, in order to ensure compliance
with the exposure limits, attention
thresholds and quality objectives for
electromagnetic emissions as required by
current legislation;

e Selection and _ contracting of the
aforementioned counterparties in line
with the provisions of the current

company guidelines;

Submission of the request for installation
and operation of radio equipment
Cincluding the aforementioned EIA) to the
Single Contact Point for Productive
Activity (SUAP) of the municipality
responsible for that area by a company
lawyer or by the company/professional
who carried out the aforementioned
analysis, by delegation of a company
representative;

Assessment of the EIA by the Regional
Agency for Environmental Protection
(ARPA) for that area. Issue of the
authorisation for installation and
operation of radio equipment by the
competent Municipality, subject to
obtaining permission from the _ local
ARPA;

Continuous monitoring of the operation
of Group radio equipment by dedicated
department via verification of the data
acquired by the equipment through
telemetry. Where anomalies are detected
that could cause the equipment to
operate at higher energy levels than those
envisaged, the department will promptly
alert the competent maintenance

companies in order to resolve any
anomalies found;

Periodic check on the operation of the
systems by — specifically contracted
companies cin 2018, transmission
equipment maintenance was entrusted to
85 external companies, with a total of
1,783 stations for Radio Studio 105 s.p.a.,
Virgin Radio Italy S.p.a., RMC Italia S.p.a.,
Monradio S.r.l., Radio Subasio S.r.l. and
Radio Aut S.r.l.);

In recent years, a complete mapping of all
the radio equipment managed by the
Mediaset Group in Italy was performed by
a specialised third-party company, aimed
at assessing the risks pertaining to
individual systems and preparing the
related RADs (Risk Assessment
Documents). Measurements were carried
out on the overall level of electromagnetic
emissions from the stations where radio
equipment operated by the Group is
installed in Italy (these were cumulative
measurements, bearing in mind that there
may be several systems belonging to
various radio companies at a_ single
location) and, where necessary,
measurements on the emissions level of
