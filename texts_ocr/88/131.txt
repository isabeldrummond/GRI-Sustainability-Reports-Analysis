broadcasting rights via collecting companies
specifically appointed for this purpose (Siae,
SCF, ...).

The programming schedule produced and
distributed by the broadcasters is
"marketed" by the advertising sales house
Mediamond S.p.a., appointed on a national
level by virtue of specific advertising
concession agreements through the sale of
space (commercials, mentions, etc.) to third-
party investors.

The actual selection of suppliers takes place,
first of all, through constant market
monitoring and careful assessment of
company needs, and their reliability is
certified through a continuous accreditation
process.

Offers are made, suppliers selected and
services contracted according to the needs
identified.

In the artistic field (mainly speakers, hosts,
guests), where each broadcaster uses
different resources depending on the
specificity of the radio business, target
listeners and audience response, the main
factors for the selection are the individual

characteristics of each artist. More generally,
the direction followed would be to make the
selection both using the criteria for the
dynamics of the competitive scenarios in
which broadcasters act, and also via the
parameters of adequacy and consistency of
remuneration/contribution with the market
prices of that particular professional
category.

Procurement of goods and services

The procurement processes of products and
services supporting cross-operational
activities refer to the following supply

categories:

e Systems and technologies

e General services - facility / cross-

functional

e TV production

The Group operates exclusively with
accredited third party suppliers registered on
the Vendor list, checking preliminary
personal data (company name, country of
residence, address, etc.), overall corporate
transparency (identification of the final
beneficial owner) and the level of

concentration of revenues (checking this
exceeds 50% threshold for a_ single
customer).

In order to better manage its suppliers, the
Group has carried out a review and
rationalisation of supplier data also in 2019 in
order to identify subjects with whom the
Group has no longer had dealings for over a

year.

Further rationalisation of the supply chain
was Carried out based on critical issues linked
to expenditure, the regulatory complexity of
the merchandise sector involved in the
commercial relationship (e.g. suppliers that
provide additional legal obligations), the
type of contract (e.g. subcontract) and
according to the employment of personnel
(employees or direct contractors of the

 

supplier or staff of third parties to whom the
service is subcontracted).

It became a requirement to obtain self-
certification on a monthly basis from the
supplier for contracts involving work services
(contracts), signed by the legal
representative, stating that the personnel
employed in rendering the services are
regularly hired, paid and insured, and
