MAPPING OF STAKEHOLDERS AND
MATERIALITY ANALYSIS

In keeping with the reporting principles
drawn up by the Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI), the first Sustainability Report was
drawn up, involving the principal company
departments, using a structured analysis
designed to identify the key stakeholders
and the most material topics for the

preparation of the Report.

For the purposes of sustainability reporting,
topics deemed material, or significant, are
those of an economic, social and
environmental nature on which a business
has a significant effect (positive or negative)
and which may substantially affect the
assessments and decisions of stakeholders.
The materiality analysis therefore takes into
consideration not only the perspective of the
organisation but also that of the stakeholders

themselves.
