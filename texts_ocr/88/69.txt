corporate Organisational Guidelines (“OGs”)
which govern the processes in which corrupt
practices may occur (both in relations with
governments and among private parties).

As already highlighted above, the Internal
Auditing Department periodically performs
specific auditing activity to identify “areas of
at-risk activity” with respect to crime, also for
corrupt practices and also as instructed by
the Supervisory and Control Bodies
appointed by the Group companies in
accordance with Legislative Decree 231/01.
There is also constant monitoring on
regulatory changes concerning corruption,
also with a view to updating the Compliance
Programmes adopted by Mediaset Group
companies in accordance with Legislative
Decree 231/01. With this in mind, the Internal
Auditing Department carried out risk analysis
activity in this reporting period concerning
the predicate crime of influence peddling,
introduced as part of Legislative Decree
231/01 by Law No 3/2019.

Moreover, regarding the topic of
competition, the Group Code of Ethics (See
also par. 13 and 3.2) contains a specific
provision’® which states that the Mediaset
Group recognises fair, free and honest
competition as a decisive factor for market
growth as well as constant improvement of
the business.

This is why the group abstains from
behaviour that encourages deals which are in
violation of current regulations.

We would also highlight the fact that, in 2019,
Mediaset decided to initiate a process with
the aim of adopting a specific antitrust
compliance programme, understood as a
system of rules predominantly directed
towards preventing potentially significant
conduct in terms of antitrust offences.

This activity is taking place following
antitrust compliance Guidelines issued by the
Antitrust Authority. The intent of the
Authority was to set out rules of conduct that
companies must implement for effective

compliance, confirming the advisability that
they equip themselves with an Antitrust
Compliance Programme.

The adoption of an adequate Compliance
Programme is recognised as a mitigating
circumstance in the event that penalties are
determined for antitrust offences.

The process described above will be
completed in 2020.

Lastly, the foreign company Publieurope has
also adopted an “anti-corruption policy” in
order to prevent any corrupt practices,
beyond the Group Code of Ethics, binding for
all employees and those who have relations
with the company. The document is posted
on the Publieurope website. The main
contracts make explicit reference to
following both the Code of Ethics of Group
and the “Bribery Act” (which addresses
policy on corruption). The figure of the
Compliance Officer has also been instated as
the individual responsible for the corruption
prevention system. Publieurope underwent a

16 Article 18 of the Group Code of Ethics. The Group's Code of Ethics is implemented by all Group companies except for the Mediaset Group in Spain, which operates its own code based on the parent Company's.

The new Code of Ethics adopted by Mediaset S.p.A. and its subsidiaries in 2019 has a specific new provision concerning competition. Article 20 (Protection of competition): “The Mediaset Group recognises fair, free and honest
competition as a decisive factor for market growth as well as constant improvement of the business. It therefore abstains from conduct that encourages dealings to its own advantage in violation of current regulations. The

Mediaset Group promotes training activity to encourage competition, standards and regulations to protect competition and ensure that they are observed.”
