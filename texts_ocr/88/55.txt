CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The Code of Ethics of the Mediaset Group
includes special provisions on conflicts of
interest.’ All recipients of the Code of Ethics
must scrupulously observe the laws and
regulations on conflicts of interest, especially
with regard to the pursuit of their business
activities and their own duties/functions. In
pursuing the interests and general objectives
of the Group, they must abstain from
conduct and action incompatible with their
obligations in connection with their relations
with Mediaset.

Consequently, in the occurrence of situations
or activities in which the recipients of the
Code of Ethics may have interests (directly
or via third parties) which are or could be in
conflict with those of the Mediaset Group,
these recipients must immediately inform

their superiors or the designated bodies, i.e.
supervisory and control bodies, where these
exist, and to respect the decisions taken by
the Mediaset Group in this regard.

Mediaset implements a "related parties
procedure” taking into account the dictates
of the regulations containing provisions on
the subject of related transactions adopted
by Consob, the provisions of the Civil Code,
and the recommendations of the Corporate
Governance Code.

The Mediaset Group is therefore committed
to taking all measures necessary for avoiding
situations which may present conflicts of

interest.”

Mediaset also establishes the necessary
measures to ensure observance of the
regulations concerning equal access of
political entities to television and radio in

application of the principles of pluralism of
information. In overly simple terms, this
activity takes the form of sending internal
company circulars to its broadcasting
structures, including news directors,
precisely indicating the requirement to
observe regulations concerning equal access
of political entities to television and to
implement the measures issued by the
Authority.

With respect to Inside Information, on 13
November 2018, with the favourable opinion
of the Risk, Control and Sustainability
Committee, an update to the corresponding

10 Art. 6 of the Group Code of Ethics. The new Code of Ethics adopted by the Mediaset Group and its subsidiaries in 2019 contains a revised and strengthened Article 6 (Conflict of interest): "1. The Mediaset Group requests that
Addresses, in their relations with the Group, adhere scrupulously to the laws and regulations that govern conflict of interest. 2. Addressees must pursue the objectives and general interests of the Mediaset Group in the
performance of their business activities and their own duties/functions and must therefore abstain from activities, conduct and action incompatible with their obligations in connection with their relations with the Group. Purely
by way of example, the following situations may constitute conflicts of interest: (i) having economic or financial interests, including through family members, in Suppliers, Clients or competitors; (ii) using one’s role within the
Mediaset Group or the information or data acquired in the performance of one’s business activities and/or own duties or functions to one’s own advantage or that of third parties contrary to the interests of the Group; (iii)
performing business activities or any kind (including services or intellectual work) for Suppliers, Clients, competitors and/or for third parties contrary to the interests of the Group; (iv) initiating negotiations and/or entering into
agreements - in the name of and/or on behalf of the Group - with family members or partners as counterparties, or with counterparties of which the Addressee is, in any capacity, owner or in which they are in any case an
interested party. 3. Addressees must without delay, taking the circumstances into account, inform their superior or, if applicable to the specific case, the person to whom they are obliged to report situations in which they may,
directly or due to third parties, have interests (even only potentially) in conflict with those of the Mediaset Group. Addressees shall respect the decisions taken by the Mediaset Group on these matters. These decisions are
communicated to the Supervisory and Control Bodies, where established by individual bodies, for the adoption of any measures by such Bodies."

"The Group undertakes to guarantee, in all possible circumstances, compliance with the Law of 20 July 2004 no. 215 “Requirements on the resolution of conflicts of interest”, and with Agcom ruling no. 417/04/CONS “Regulations
on the resolution of conflicts of interest” (amended by ruling no. 392/05/CONS 682/11/CONS).
