“YouRatelt” system was successfully tested
on Mediaset’s 16mm.it platform. “YouRatelt”
is a classification tool for user-generated
content produced between 2013 and 2015, in
collaboration with the British BBFC and
Dutch Nicam (two. of the _ leading
organisations assessing audiovisual content
in Europe). Following this testing, the
European Commission decided to introduce
content classification tools - Art. 28 ter 3.
letter g)- among the measures in the
proposed revision of the Audiovisual Media
Services Directive (Directive (EU) 2018/1808
of 14 November 2018, effective from 19
December 2018). These measures, deemed
appropriate for the protection of minors on
video sharing platforms, may include the
mechanisms applied by “YouRatelt”. The
European Commission explicitly cited the
experience of the “YouRatelt” pilot in
Mediaset among the interventions to protect
minors from harmful content on Internet
platforms, as part of the Impact Assessment
document which accompanied the proposal
to revise the Directive.

The Group has also kept its role on the
Advisory Board of the Safer Internet Centre
for the Italia-Generazioni Connesse project,

coordinated by the Ministry of Education,
University and Research.

Mediaset TV news and public service and in-
depth information programmes focused
continuously on the issue of cyberbullying
and the potential risks connected with the
Internet.

Regarding commercial communication, the
advertising sales house Publitalia ‘80 also
supervises compliance with the provisions
contained in the Self-Regulatory Code of
Commercial Communication.

As for product placement, with specific
reference to the betting sector, the contents
are shared internally with the Mediaset S.p.A.
legal office before each televised broadcast.

Regarding the participation of minors in the
content produced, the Mediaset Group in
Spain, in addition to following’ the
procedures issued by the Community of
Madrid Labour Department, has drawn up a
manual in which all necessary information
concerning the rights of minors is collected
to ensure children's activities on television
are suitable and to ensure that their right to
education and enjoyment of their leisure is

not violated. This manual is available on the
intranet and is provided to all production
companies who employ minors to implement
the measures presented.

Furthermore, the Code of Ethics of Mediaset
Espana states that, as a basic principle, "no
one should behave in such a way as to
induce, promote, favour, permit or allow acts
or attitudes that could be characterised as

prostitution or corruption of minors”.

As for the impact of the content transmitted
to minors, the Spanish regulation requires the
classification of the audiovisual content to be
transmitted, defined in the framework of
content self-regulation, signed by the
operators of free-to-air television in 2015 and
under the supervision of the Spanish National
Commission on Markets and Competition
(CNCM). According to this self-regulation
framework, all televised content must be
classified, except for news and events
broadcasting (sport, music, culture, politics,
bullfights and bull runs).

For these purposes, the Department of
Institutional Relations works continuously in
close contact with the Antenna Department
in order to clarify and qualify any content
