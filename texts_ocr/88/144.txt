7.1 COMMITMENT TO
ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION

The Group's commitment to the environment
is also referred to within the Group's Code of
Ethics*®, with special reference to the
conduct and provisions on environmental
protection, which highlight the central role of
environmental protection as a key factor in
the company.

The Mediaset Group is inspired by the
principles of respect and protection of the
environment and the local territory, and their
impact on the health of humans and other
living species. To achieve this goal, all
Mediaset business activity complies with the
highest standards of compatibility and
environmental safety.

As proof of this commitment, the Group has
adopted a specific Corporate Organisational

Guideline (O.G. "Requirements for

environmental protection”) which describes
the activities carried out for the collection
and disposal of waste produced, which is
treated according to the principles of
selective separation and recycling of waste
wherever possible and as required by current
laws and best operating practices.

7.2 MANAGEMENT OF
ELECTROMAGNETIC
EMISSIONS

The Mediaset Group Italia?” has always been

committed to respecting the sector
legislation on electromagnetic emissions.

Elettronica Industriale S.p.A., a subsidiary of
the Mediaset Group, is required to present
documentation to the local authorities
certifying compliance with the field limits of
plants for the installation of new plants or for
the modification of existing plants.

In 2019, 158 requests were made to modify
plants, 99% of which were approved as
compliant with current regulations, including
compliance with the population exposure
limits for electromagnetic fields.

These activities allow the Group to monitor
the impact produced by any changes made
to the plants throughout the area and ensure
the non-existence of any negative effects
due to radio-television signal emissions. The
applications must obligatorily contain all
electromagnetic impact assessments of the
plants subject to the authorisation request.

The Electromagnetic Impact Analysis (EIA)
for larger plants are extremely thorough and

include “pre-existing electromagnetic

36 The specific provision has been confirmed in the new Code of Ethics adopted by Mediaset S.p.A. and its subsidiaries in 2019: Art. 26 (Environmental protection) "1. The Mediaset Group considers protecting the environment
to be a key factor in the company and is inspired by the principles of respect for and protection of the environment and the local territory, due both to their intrinsic value and their impact on the health of humans and other
living species. To this end, the Mediaset Group is committed to observing the regulations in force and works so that all its business activity complies with the highest standards of environmental safety and compatibility.

2. Particular attention is dedicated to the collection and disposal of waste produced by the company, which wherever possible is treated according to the principles of selective separation and recycling of waste, to reduce the
impact on the environment to a minimum and as required by current laws and best operating practices.”

37 The issue of electromagnetism is taken into consideration only in Italy as the Mediaset Group in Spain does not directly manage the signal transmission network.
