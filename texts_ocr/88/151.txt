Group coming out of the scope of reporting.
Its business is characterised by high energy
consumption.

In particular, it should be noted that all
electricity purchased by the Mediaset Group
in Spain (equal to about 17.03 GWh in 2019)
is certified and comes from renewable
sources through Guarantees of Origin. This
consumption is mainly due to the technical
equipment of the studios, including
recording, transmission and post-production
equipment, as well as computer equipment
and air conditioning in IT rooms.

Activity to achieve greater efficiency in terms
of the above consumption continued in 2019,
above all by replacing the above equipment
which is most energy inefficient and
obsolete.

Natural gas is used to heat offices,
laboratories and warehouses only,
comprising around 7% of total energy
consumption. A 26% reduction was recorded
compared to 2018, due to the El Towers

Group coming out of scope.

However, the consumption of diesel and
petrol in 2019 amounted to about 31 TJ,

mainly due to the company car fleet and the
operation of a few generators.

The Mediaset Group company fleet consists
of leased cars and a car fleet specifically
owned for the Mediaset Group in Spain.

In 2019, the Group's activities generated
greenhouse gas emissions due to direct
energy consumption (natural gas, petrol and
diesel) and indirect energy consumption
(electricity) of the Group itself. In particular,
a high proportion of the greenhouse gas
emissions are due to Scope 2 emissions, for
which Mediaset is indirectly responsible, as it
derives from the electricity supply purchased
externally. However, the zero contribution of
the Mediaset Group Espafia to these type of
emissions (according to the Market-based
approach) is noteworthy, since all electricity
of the Group is covered by certificates of
guarantee of origin.

The reporting standard used (GRI
Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016)
provides for two different approaches to
calculating Scope 2 emissions: "location-
based" and "market-based". The "location-
based" approach envisages the use of a
national average emission factor related to

the specific national energy mix for the
production of electricity Cemission
coefficient used for Italy of 359 gCO2/kWh,
for Spain of 296 gCO2/kWh and for France
of 72 gCO2/kWh - Source: TERNA,
International Comparisons 2019). The
"Market-based" approach envisages the use
of an emission factor defined on a
contractual basis with the electricity supplier.
Given the absence of specific contractual
agreements between Mediaset Group
companies in Italy and the electricity supplier
(e.g. purchase of Guarantees of Origin), the
emission factor relating to the national
"residual mix" was used for this approach
(emission coefficient used in Italy of 483
gCO2/kWh and for France of 51 gCO2/kWh -
Source: Association of Issuing Bodies,
European Residual Mixes 2018, 2019). Note
too that Mediaset Group companies in Spain
do not use Scope 2 emissions for the
"market-based" approach since they
purchase electricity from renewable sources
certified with Guarantees of Origin.

However, the direct emissions of Scope 1
generated directly within the Group due to
the use of fuels for heating, generators and
the car fleet amount to approximately 4,116
tCO2. For the latter, there was a substantial
