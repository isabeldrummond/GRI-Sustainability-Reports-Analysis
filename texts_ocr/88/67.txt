14 Comision Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia

Throughout the year, the Mediaset Group in
Spain backed the following national and
international projects, interacting with public
bodies and institutions:

e Application of the General Law on
Audiovisual Communication and_ its
regulatory development, with particular
emphasis on strengthening the protection
of minors and proper implementation of
the provisions applicable to TV

commercials;

e Application of a new “system of
classification by age range in relation to
the use of audiovisual products” (signed
by free-to-air TV operators in 2015 under
the supervision of CNMc)".

This rating system was launched with the
aim to establish a more objective and
systematic framework for classifying
content, and as a tool that provides
information to guardians, the children
themselves and society on the whole, on
potentially harmful content that a certain
audiovisual programme may contain;

e Application of the rules on gambling and

responsible implementation of new online
gambling games. Mediaset Espafia is on
the Board Of Directors of the Responsible
Gambling Advisory, formed by the Office
for the Regulation of Gambling and by the
Code of Conduct Monitoring Committee
on business communication for gambling.

Defence of an open and _ transparent
television service directed towards the
public interest with control and
compliance mechanisms, particularly

with regard to the advertising market.

Participation in the process of
transposing EU Directive 2018/1808 of 14
November 2018 on audiovisual media
services into national law.
