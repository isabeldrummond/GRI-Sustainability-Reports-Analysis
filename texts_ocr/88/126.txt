In addition, the Group aims to oversee the
certification activities of the various
categories of suppliers with a_ single
organisational unit, thus facilitating the
identification of any factors that influence the
selection and management of the portfolio.

Given the particular business of the
companies in the Group, the main purchase
activities of all companies fall into three

macro areas:

e Acquisition of broadcasting rights (films,

series and sporting events);

e Acquisition of content (entertainment,
news, drama) for the various distribution
platforms;

e Acquisition of goods and services to
support televised production and cross-
production.

The related procurement processes for each
of these areas are described below with

evidence of their main purchase poles.

Acquisition of Rights

The Mediaset Group acquires the following
through R.T.I. S.p.A.: serial content (TV
series), films (also through the subsidiary
Medusa), documentaries and sports,
depending on the programming needs of
free-to-air and pay TV.

These acquisitions are negotiated directly
with the owners of the contents or their
broadcasting rights.

The Vendor list for the selection of suppliers
is prepared, updated and submitted to the
Risk, Control and Sustainability Committee
every six months, and annually to the
Executive Committee and the Board of
Directors of Mediaset S.p.a., in compliance
with the corporate organisational guidelines.

The assessment includes the verification of
any ongoing proceedings, such as
liquidation, bankruptcy and mergers, and
also includes the transparency of the
corporate chain.

Furthermore, suppliers resident in countries
with preferential taxation entered on the
Black List are not considered for the
purposes of this selection.

The selection of suppliers of rights takes
place through the widespread coverage of
the national and_ international content
distribution market - while also participating
in major sector events - giving preference to
companies with consolidated experience and
expertise: North American majors and
minimajors, European studios, leading Italian
and international independent distributors.

In particular, the Group refers to American
majors for the acquisition and distribution of
cinema broadcasting rights on free and pay
TV, and to European majors almost
exclusively for free TV only.

Special attention is paid to Italian works and
is aimed at both current and library works,
through the acquisition by a Group company
of cinematographic works from independent
producers, and through commercial
agreements with companies outside the
Group who are specifically dedicated to
domestic production.

The Purchasing Rights Department maintains
commercial relations with all the major Italian
film distributors, through  multi-annual
volume agreements and prompt
procurement.
