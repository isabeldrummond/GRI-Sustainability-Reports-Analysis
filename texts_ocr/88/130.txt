project examined and the broadcasting line
of the Group.

Historically, drama productions are solely
Italian in origin.

In 2019 initial experiments began in co-
financing agreements with SVOD operators
(Amazon and Netflix) on original
productions. The innovative arrangement
specifically involves partial financing by the
Group and availability of the product after an
exclusive initial window for the SVOD

operators.

Furthermore, remaining on the topic of
changes in the supply chain, it should be
noted that the contractual templates
predominantly used in the past, or the
contracting templates, have gradually been
replaced by co-production and pre-purchase
templates due to the new legislation on tax
credits for audiovisual production, thus
entering a residual category.

Almost all Taodue suppliers are Italian. In
general, the main categories of suppliers
used by Taodue for the creation of their
drama include: actors, screenwriters,
directors and copyrights, all selected thanks

to continuous scouting in the reference
market which makes use of the experience of
the Taodue founder, as well as technical
production personnel and companies
supplying goods and services.

In cases where the use of minors is expected
in the production, the company, which is
required to comply with specific provisions
of the law that regulate its employment, has
set up adequate organisational procedures
and contractual models shared with the
Group's legal support.

Digital - Acquisitions and investments
provided by the Digital area of the Group
focus on the following macro-areas:

e acquisitions in the development of

technological products;

e investments in the production’ of

contents;

e investments to promote the distribution
of content produced internally by
Mediaset agencies and productions.

The total number of suppliers involved
throughout the year for the various activities

is about 123, mainly resident in Italy, while
some are from the United States.

Given the speed of changes the digital sector
is particularly prone to, selection of suppliers
is always up to whichever partner companies
demonstrate a marked predisposition to
technological and product innovation.

Radio - The core activity of the Mediaset
Group's radio stations consists in the
production and issue of entertainment
content and musical flows aimed at Italian
radio listeners.

For the conduct of its business, it mainly
relies on the service provided by speakers,
hosts and authors employed for the creation
and management of the programming
schedule on broadcasters 105, Virgin Radio,
R101, RMC and Radio Subasio. These include
135 Italian freelancers, most of whom are
known within the radio and television scene.
Most collaborators are Italian, but a limited
number of foreign resources are also
contracted.

The main radio content is Italian and foreign
music, which is indirectly acquired from the
record companies, with repayment of
