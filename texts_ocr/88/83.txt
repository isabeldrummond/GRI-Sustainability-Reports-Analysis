During the year, the Information hub

Distribution agreements were confirmed
with all main partners in 2019: IOL (which
combines the top 2 portals Libero and
Virgilio), with Microsoft (msn.it) Citynews

(Today.it and all vertical websites), Fanpage

(Ciaopeople publishing group) and
SuperguidaTV, the most important Italian

digital TV guide.

These agreements make the best use of and
promote the content chosen by R.T.l.,
allowing another audience to be reached,
available according to the different needs of
the broadcaster or sales house. Taking
external distribution into account as well, the
video view total exceeds 1.5 billion videos for

the year.

Note that Auditel measurement of digital
audience on different devices began in 2019.
This measurement will lead to Auditel
identifying the Total Audience in 2021.

As far as Radio is concerned, 2019 saw
further revamping of some of our stations’
main digital destinations, with the creation in
particular of the new RMC and Radio Subasio
websites as well as the release of the new
United Music App, which has one of the
biggest free music offerings.

In relation to Social Media Network
presence, Mediaset confirmed itself as one of
the leading European media companies in
creating engagement with its communities:
41 million total likes on Mediaset network

Facebook pages, over 8 million followers on
Twitter accounts and more than 12 million
followers on Instagram accounts.

Social Media Network activity allows the
attention of the active audience to be
captured on various channels, differing by
age and composition.

The distribution of exclusive content,
previews and live streaming promotes the TV
schedule and expands programme
awareness to a digital audience, creating
interaction opportunities. Short programme
extracts accompanied by a direct link to our
websites attract traffic to Mediaset Play,
increasing the viewing numbers of videos on

the platform.

2019 saw the creation of the first synergies
between Mediaset Play's AVOD = and
Infinity's SVOD. This will generate new
sources of revenue connected to the free-to-
air networks’ digital business, but also and
above all in terms of organisation, to create a
shared customer journey aiming to identify
free-to-air/pay users as individual Mediaset
customers.
