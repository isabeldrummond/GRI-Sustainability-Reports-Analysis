In 2019, the various radio stations of the
Mediaset Group broadcast over 800 radio
spots in support of those most in need. In
addition to the above "Mediaset ha a cuore il
tuo futuro” we would also mention "Never
give up”, a campaign to raise awareness
around eating disorders which affect young
people in particular and "Fondazione Sic"
etc. with its many projects to support
children and young people.

Mediaset social campaigns are also a
tradition in Spain: the latest is the "Diritto a
giocare” initiative for children in
collaboration with the Spanish Observatory
of Children's Play in collaboration with
psychologists, educators and _ international

scientists.

Finally, the activity of Mediafriends Onlus
(see Cap. 6 Community and Territory - Social
utility initiatives), a non-profit organisation, is
a concrete expression of how Mediaset
understands Corporate Social Responsibility.

Over the years, Mediafriends has supported
numerous TV and other events to raise funds
for the projects of non-profit associations.
The best known of these is "Fabbrica del
sorriso”, which in 14 years of activity has

made it possible to finance countless charity
projects in Italy and around the world, in
particular for children and young people in
difficult situations and poverty.

The Fabbrica del Sorriso fundraising project
continued in the first part of 2019, for four
charities: Amref, Mission Bambini, Comunita
di Sant’Egidio and A regola d’Arte.

The innovative “A Regola d’Arte” (ARdA)
project, in particular, is aimed towards
disadvantaged Italian and foreign children
living in the suburbs of Italian cities and seeks
to promote integration and social
development through music and rugby.
Mediafriends supports eight ARdA centres: in
Milan, two schools (in the Baggio and Via
Dolci districts), church facilities (in the
Giambellino district) and three youth centres
(Barrios, Barona district; La Strada, Trecca
district; Ermanno Olmi, Baggio district). The
“A Regola d’Arte (ARdA) project expanded
in the autumn of 2019 with the opening of a
centre at the Murialdo church facilities in
Naples, in the Luzzati district, in addition to
the centres of Palermo in collaboration with
Ciai Onlus and L’Aquila with Action Aid. More
than 300 children are on the rugby and music
courses and take part in formative activities.

The Fabbrica del Sorriso's autumn event was
dedicated to an Associazione _ Italiana
Persone Down - Livorno project aiming to
provide work experience for young people, in
order to help them be independent, ensure a
future for themselves and become an asset
to society. In addition to slots in Mediaset
network programmes, SMS donations were
promoted, as well as a book of children’s
stories, with some of the proceeds going to
the project. The fundraiser closed on 31
December 2019 with the New Year's concert
broadcast on Canale 5.
