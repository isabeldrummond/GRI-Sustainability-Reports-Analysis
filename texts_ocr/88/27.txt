platforms, consequently promoting access
on the part of the coming generation.

These are the main results of the digital
activity:

e total Mediaset Properties Video Content
consumption amounted to around 1.4

e during 2019, the Information hub
(TGCOM24, Sportmediaset and Meteo. it)

place in the Italian digital information
market.

In relation to Social Media Network
presence, Mediaset confirmed itself as one of
the leading European media companies: 41
million total fans on Mediaset network
Facebook pages, over 8 million followers on
Twitter and more than 12 million followers on
Instagram.

In Spain too, the Group has a broadcast
offering targeted at the coming generation;
we might take the example of Gran Hermano
Vip (39.1% share for the 13-24 age group),
Supervivientes (38.5% share for the same
group) or La Que se avecina (30.2% share).

In terms of digital offerings, we would
highlight the introduction of the Mitele
platform, which enables innovative
interaction between the content offered and

the end user.

In the area of managing human resources
(see Chapter 5 "People”), categorised as
stakeholders, Mediaset has launched
managerial development projects through
classroom sessions and individual training
meetings for young graduates.

The commitment and motivation of
employees are considered essential to the
Group’s success. Young people are also
constantly offered opportunities for
professional growth, capitalising on the
diversity of origin, experience and
competence of the new resources.

Finally, we would recall that, again taking the
new social dynamics and lifestyles linked to
technological evolution into account,
experimentation with the Smart Working
project was launched in 2019 and will be
extended in 2020 through progressive
phases of experimentation to all areas of the
company assessed as compatible.

It should also be noted that the Mediaset
Group is highly attentive in both Italy and
Spain to internship opportunities that
supplement and complete courses of study in
collaboration with major universities. During
internships, young undergraduates can
approach the world of work, experiencing
professional relationships and using the
knowledge acquired during their studies.

people not employed by the company, the
