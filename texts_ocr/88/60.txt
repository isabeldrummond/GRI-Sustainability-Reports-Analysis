e the proximity of housing to transmitters
or the issue by municipalities of new
building permits for the construction of
housing close to plants;

e the presence on the same site of other

broadcasters (particularly radio
broadcasters), which can result in the
limits being exceeded when emissions are

aggregated.

Mediaset’s installations are designed,
developed and operated in compliance with
Italian law. In accordance with the Group’s
operating practices, all necessary measures
are taken, when designing new sites or
modifying existing ones, to keep the
electromagnetic field levels within the
parameters set by the regulations. In
particular:

e the construction of tall towers for
transmission antennas in order to keep
them as far as possible from areas
accessible to the population;

e improved orientation of transmission
antennas, to concentrate the signal on the
area to be served and use less power
minimising the electromagnetic radiation

detectable at ground level (areas
accessible to the population);

e identification, where possible, of

installation sites far from residential areas;

e submission of the project for prior
assessment and authorisation by local
authorities and regional environmental
protection agencies, as required by the
Code of Electronic Communications
(Italian Legislative Decree 259/03)

In addition, specific company departments
are responsible for mapping installations
with a risk of exceeding the electromagnetic
field limits and establishing monitoring plans
as well as, where necessary, the use of
internal and external resources (certified
external advisors).

Risks connected to Corporate Governance

The typical corporate governance-related
risks, such as the risk of non-compliance with
laws and regulations, improper assignment
of powers and authorities, or inappropriate
remuneration policies, are mitigated through
the implementation of a strong system of
Corporate Governance. Since 2000,
Mediaset has adopted the provisions of the

Corporate Governance Code for Listed
Companies and, over the years, it has
continued to bring its own Corporate
Governance system into line with applicable
domestic and international best practices,
the recommendations of the Corporate
Governance Code of the Italian Stock
Exchange and applicable regulatory
provisions.

Using the same risk management model,
implemented in 2007 and regularly updated
each year, the Mediaset Group in Spain
implements an assessment process designed
to identify risks in its own industrial context.
Every year, the Board of Directors of
Mediaset Espafia assesses the risks the
Mediaset Group in Spain is exposed to, and
evaluates the internal control systems
implemented, identifying possible areas for
improvement. In particular, the Internal Audit
and Compliance departments evaluate the
specific risks to which the Mediaset Group in
Spain is exposed, assessing the likelihood of
occurrence and extent of impact and directly
involving the various corporate departments
in the evaluation process. The Risk
Committee, whose members are. the
managing directors of companies belonging
to the Mediaset Group in Spain, is responsible
