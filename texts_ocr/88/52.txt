INTEGRITY IN BUSINESS

CODE OF ETHICS

As indicated in paragraph 1.3 above, the
Code of Ethics of the Mediaset Group defines
the values which the Group. cherishes,
accepts and shares at every level in the
pursuit of its business activities.

The new Code of Ethics was approved in
2019, following a process of revision in 2018.
This was made necessary by, among other
things, the development of Mediaset Group
business activities, the need to harmonise the
provisions of the Code of Ethics with the
Compliance Programmes (Legislative Decree
231/01) adopted by Group Companies and
adaptation to regulatory changes (e.g. with
respect to whistle-blowing).

The principles and provisions of the Code of
Ethics are binding on directors, auditors, all
persons holding an employment contract
with Mediaset Group companies and all
persons working for/with the Mediaset
Group, regardless of the nature of their

employment relationship, even temporary,
with the company (e.g. employees, suppliers,
clients etc.).

Respect for the principles and values
enshrined in the Code of Ethics is of
fundamental importance for the correct
operation, reliable management and image

of the Mediaset Group®.

All activities of the Group are therefore
pursued in a spirit of fair competition, in full
respect for the laws and regulations of the
jurisdictions of all countries in which it
operates, and for the ethical principles
commonly applied in the pursuit of business,
such as honesty, fairness, propriety,
transparency and good faith.

The Mediaset Group propagates the
principles and values enshrined in its Code of
Ethics via targeted information campaigns,
especially with regard to its corporate
bodies, staff and employees, encouraging
them to apply and strictly observe these
principles and values.

The Code of Ethics is issued to all employees
of the Group together with their salary
