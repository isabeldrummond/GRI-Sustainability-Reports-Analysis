With regard to multi-annual agreements, the
Purchasing Department envisages’ the
purchase not just of individual contents, but
stipulates "volume" agreements that include
varied product categories, based on the
annual production of the supplier. For this
reason, the selection and acquisition of
individual contents are conditioned by the
contractual terms of the multi-year
agreement which define the minimum
volumes by product type and the methods
for selection. There are currently two volume
deals, one with Warner and a second with
Universal.

As for ad hoc acquisitions, selection is carried
out based on the approval of the product by
the market, or based on the interest stirred
by content in countries that are continuously
monitored, via information that the suppliers
send to the Purchasing Department and by
assessing the product directly through the
monitoring of satisfaction ratings in cinemas,
paid channels and streaming networks.

Once interest has been established for that
particular product, rights acquisition usually
takes place in order to ensure that this is
available on different platforms (e.g. Infinity,
pay TV and free TV). Given the different

needs of the platforms, a percentage of the
budget is then allocated to exclusive
purchases for each of these.

The following key events occurred in 2019-
2020:

- as part of a renewed commitment to
acquire sports broadcasting rights, some
of the agreements reached relate to the
UEFA Champions League for the 2019-

Nations League;

concerned, the second year of the
agreement with Fox, and the agreement
with Paramount (including the FBI spin-
off, FB| MOST WANTED), is in progress.
Together with the Warner and Universal
volume deals, these agreements
guarantee us free-to-air TV film and series
premieres and the best evergreen film
and serial catalogue titles. An agreement
was also reached with Sony for the
purchase of the series based on the film
The Bone Collector, entitled LINCOLN
RHYME.

- a focus on recent Italian cinema

continues, both in terms of films produced
within the Group and those created by
third-party partners, with the acquisition
of broadcasting rights for _ films
distributed by Medusa Film and Vision
Distribution respectively in the 2018
season

- acquisition of free TV broadcasting rights
for independently produced or European
series such as: Cathedral of the Sea
(Endemol), Time is a Killer (Federation),
Olivia (TF1), At home in the mountain
(Beta).

The owned film library was boosted during
the year with the definitive purchase of 100%
ownership shares in films produced by
Massimo Troisi, including // Postino, Pensavo
fosse Amore, invece era un calesse and Le vie
de/ signore sono finite. A prestigious
transaction was also completed with
Melampo concerning the TV broadcasting
