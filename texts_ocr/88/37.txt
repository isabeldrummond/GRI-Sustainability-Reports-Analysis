SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
(SDGs)

In this document, it was deemed appropriate
to link the SDGs that could be related directly
to the main topics presented, from the 17
Sustainable Development Goals defined by
the United Nations in 2015 and contained in
the Sustainable Development Agenda.

These objectives contain the Guidelines that
commit governments and_ international
economic actors to achieving specific
environmental, social and economic targets
by 2030.

These links were established by analytically
comparing the 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) with the material topics and the
Group's characteristic activities and services.
The following 11 sustainable development
objectives were identified on the basis of this
analysis.
