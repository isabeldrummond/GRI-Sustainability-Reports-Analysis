adoption of more efficient operating models
capable of supporting investment to develop
the core activities of all broadcasters within
the company.

Having examined the guidelines, we would
also note that the positive consolidated
performance achieved in 2019 was by no
means something to take for granted, in a
constantly changing competitive context
which is ever more crowded. The Group’s
sound progress boosts awareness of the
strength of our values and our distinctive
traits, which we once more place at the
centre of this Non-Financial Statement. To
recap:

- recognisability and authoritativeness in
Mediaset's content produced in house,
much of which is broadcast live;

- professionalism, ability in relations with
the business customers of our sales
houses, which are confirmed market
leaders thanks to a unique cross-media
offering, at the cutting edge in terms of
using new technology, from addressable
advertising to programmatic;

- constant focus on minors, diversity,
protecting women and commitment to

defending human rights and eliminating
every form of discrimination;

- increasing investment in policies to
promote better working conditions for
our employees in terms of health, safety,
welfare and well-being, increasing our
Group's attractiveness to young talents to
recruit to key areas such as technology,
content and advertising;

- no-profit and = social communication
activity;

- full compliance with material ESG
(Environmental, Social and Governance)
criteria for sustainable performance;

directed
towards. controlling and managing

- transparent governance,
strategic and operational risks thanks to
firmly established dialogue with financial
markets, institutions and authorities.

All these factors combined enable us to be
included in FTSE4Good for the second year
running. This basket of stocks relates to
companies characterised by sustainable
business management.

All this reinforces the attention that Mediaset
has always assigned to the coming

generation, all the more so at this juncture
marked by constant, rapid change in
consumer dynamics and multi-device use of
media content, lending impetus to a swift
internal generational transition.

The coming generation now perfectly
represents modern public opinion. They
possess values connected to sustainability
and are key” players’ in changing
consumption. The ruling class has a
responsibility to act urgently and without
delay to guarantee sustainable development,
also in light of proven climate, environmental
and social emergencies.

This is why we have dedicated a specific
section to our commitment to and focus on
young people in this year’s Non-Financial
Statement. This applies both to young
people as the audience of our programmes,
the target of awareness-raising, positive,
educational and informative messages - as
the social responsibility of broadcasters
demands - and as professionals we wish to
offer work opportunities and collaboration. It
also applies to students who wish to take on
the challenge of training and specialisation
pathways in our Master's and internships.
