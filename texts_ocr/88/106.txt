young undergraduates and graduates.

The selection process is in any case always
preceded by a careful analysis of qualitative-
quantitative coherence regarding the size of
the workforce, with respect to the
organisational needs of the companies and
also. evaluating, where possible, the
professional development of _ internal

resources.

In Italy, more than 750 interviews were
carried out during 2019, for both profiles with
professional experience and internships.

The selection process is aimed at identifying
the most suitable candidates, from the point
of view of both technical and professional
skills as well as soft skills, with the aim of
seeking the key skills that the company
considers a_ critical success factor for

achieving corporate goals.

In particular, over the years the Group has
consolidated a set of key distinctive skills,
relating to the cognitive and _ relational-
emotional areas, to be sought in the selection
processes of figures from the external market
and to identify and evaluate in planning the

development trajectories for internal

resources.

These soft skills in fact represent a critical
success factor, common to all areas but
differentiated according to the role and
degree of seniority, for achievement of
corporate objectives at both the group and
individual growth levels and flank the
professional skills necessary for the various
roles in the organisation.

behaviours and attitudes that people tend to
adopt during the selection or assessment
phase allow us to estimate the following
significant skills and abilities to be projected
