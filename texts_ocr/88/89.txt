In order to avoid any proceedings for
misleading advertising, Mediaset Espana
voluntarily submits any doubtful case in
advance to the Association for the Self-
Regulation of Commercial Communication
(Autocontrol). 1,419 requests for an opinion in
advance were submitted to Autocontrol in
2019.

The internal monitoring process o
advertising content also provides further
verification, even after airing (in the event o
disputes or claims for compensation).

The Mediaset Group in Spain performs
further reviews to regulate televised conten
for children; this monitoring and contro
includes issues regarding the advertisemen
of certain food products (to preven
obesity), messages on the environment,
advertising toys, and the promotion o
medicinal products or alcoholic beverages.

 

Further compliance checks are carried ou
with regard to advertising spots for the
gambling and betting sector.
