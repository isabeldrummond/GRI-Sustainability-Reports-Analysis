1.2 HISTORY

Before 1996 The origins of the Mediaset

Group lie in the late 1970s, when Milan-
based entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi
founded a local cable TV channel,
Telemilano, broadcasting from its

purpose-built headquarters.

Two years later, in 1980, Telemilano was
rebaptised as Canale 5. Due to a change
in the regulations, it began transmitting all
over Italy, something hitherto prohibited
under Italian law.

The new channel was a breath of fresh air
for the Italian viewing public, because
until then the only national broadcaster
was the state-controlled Rai, whose three
channels constituted a monopoly.

To compete on equal terms with the
public service broadcaster, the new
private broadcaster put together its own
3-network offering: Canale 5 was joined
by Italia 1 (acquired from Rusconi in 1982)
and Retequattro (acquired from Arnoldo
Mondadori Editore in 1984).

The new broadcaster was named Rti (Reti
televisive italiane) and was assisted by an

exclusive advertising sales agency,
Publitalia ‘80, and two other companies:
Videotime, which was in charge of
technology and TV _ production, and
Elettronica Industriale, which managed
the transmission network infrastructure.

Together, Rti, Publitalia, Videotime and
Elettronica Industriale were placed under
the control of a new company, Mediaset.
And so the Mediaset Group was born.

1996 Mediaset is floated on the Milan stock

exchange, opening its stock to
institutional investors and small

shareholders (around 300,000).

1997 Mediaset's international expansion

begins with its acquisition of a 25% stake
in private Spanish broadcaster Telecinco.

1999 The Group enters the online world

with Mediaset.it (a website dedicated to
Canale 5, Italia 1 and Retequattro) and
Mediaset Online (renamed TgCom in
2001), a news site available over multiple
platforms (internet, television, radio,
Mediavideo teletext and mobile phone).

2003 Mediaset increases its stake in

Telecinco, gaining a controlling interest in

the company with 50.1% of its shares.
Telecinco is floated on the Madrid stock
exchange the following year.

2004 Digital terrestrial television launches

in Italy. The new technology allows many
more channels to be broadcast than with
the existing analogue system. Mediaset
launches Boing, a channel directed
exclusively at children, and
Mediashopping, a secure teleshopping

channel.

2005 The Group launches Mediaset

Premium, a digital terrestrial channel
offering live coverage of Serie A football
via smartcards, with no need _ for
subscription. Mediaset Premium also
offers TV movie premieres, theatre and
live events in the pay-per-view format.

2006 Pan's Labyrinth, a film produced by

Gruppo Telecinco, wins 3 Oscars.

2007 In aconsortium with Cyrte Fund and

Goldman Sachs, Mediaset relieves
Telefonica of control of Endemol, a Dutch
TV production company and the world's
leading format producer.

Mediaset also acquires Medusa, Italy's
