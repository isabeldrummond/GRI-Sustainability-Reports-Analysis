needs and opportunities that characterise
the television business.

With this in mind, a variety of working hours
has been contractually defined with the trade
unions which flexibly meets the needs of
both the company and its workers.
Specifically and for most employees, with
various specific exceptions for the
operational needs of the various
organisational structures, it is possible to
clock in flexibly between 9.00 and 10.30 am.
The remaining workers, engaged in
production activity, benefit from a 7-hour
work day, rather than 8.

Moreover, from an operational point of view,
reductions in working hours are generally
granted to personnel requesting this in all the
areas of the company, in the presence of the
technical and organisational conditions and
where the job permits so; to date, 321 people
in the entire Mediaset Group benefit from a
part-time contract, 85% of whom are women.
Reductions in working hours are in fact used
to a large extent by female workers who, in
particular after returning from maternity
leave, ask for a reorganisation of their
working life, benefiting from a few hours

more each day to dedicate to their private
life.

Experimentation with the Smart Working
project began in 2019. It started with an initial
3-month pilot phase involving around 175
people in Human Resources, Technology and
Procurement.

At the end of the pilot, the usage data
collected and quality feedback from
employees and managers led to institutional
confirmation for all employees involved and
the decision to extend the project. A second
experimental phase for all remaining staff
areas (around 215 employees) was launched
and will end in February 2020. The project
will extend still further in 2020, to all areas of
the company deemed compatible, through
progressive experimental phases.
