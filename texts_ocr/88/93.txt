that may have an impact on regulations for

minors.

The age classification established determines
the time slot in which each programme may
be broadcast.

Furthermore, prior to the transmission of
programmes involving children, a preliminary
approval by the Child Protection Authority is
required in addition to the aforementioned
verification.

Finally, thanks to the Parental Control
system, the Group ensures a safe browsing
environment for registered users on the
Mitele platform and on all devices. On
websites with specific content aimed at
children and young people, the advertising
used is segmented to avoid the risk of
promoting unsuitable products or services
that do not comply with the rules described
above.

Please note that there were five sentences
from the CNCM in 2019 that resulted in

penalties for the Company due to non-
compliance with marketing communication
regulations, a total amount of 1.02 million

euros.

4.4 PROTECTION OF
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The Mediaset Group considers respect for
and protection of intellectual property to be
of strategic importance and, to protect its
audiovisual rights, prosecutes those
responsible for pirated transmission of its
content, regardless of the medium.

We start with careful monitoring using
specialised companies and, once we have
identified pirated content, we proceed to
caution the pirates, with the help of external
legal firms where required, and in the event
of repeat offences file administrative actions
with AGCOM via civil and criminal lawsuits,

both to prevent offences and to obtain
compensation.

These actions have resulted in judges taking
measures with significant compensatory
obligations which, although pending further
stages, confirm the legal direction of
copyright protection. Particular attention
was also paid to anti-piracy activity for
Group-owned films in cinemas.

The same level of attention for intellectual
property is also recommended to internal
production facilities, for which the Collective
Management of Copyright and Related
Rights provides preventative advice on
request.

The Group is also present in all national and
European institutions that deal with
copyright legislation.

As evidence of the importance and care that
Mediaset dedicates to the protection of
intellectual property, the Code of Ethics of

the Group” has a specific article on this

21 The Group's Code of Ethics is implemented by all Group companies except for the Mediaset Group in Spain, which operates its own code based on the parent Company's. The new Code of Ethics adopted by Mediaset S.p.A.
and its subsidiaries in 2019 contains Article 12 (Intellectual property), which states: "1. The Mediaset Group holds important intellectual and industrial property rights, deeming their correct management fundamental. All Addressees

protects the intellectual and industrial property rights of others, ensuring that company activities (in both production and commerce) use solely original products and works, regularly licensed by the legitimate owners and used
