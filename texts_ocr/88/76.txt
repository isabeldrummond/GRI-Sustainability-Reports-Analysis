Television series and films

Mediaset Group broadcasts TV series that
appeal to all audiences. When it selects TV
series the group adheres to the broadcasting
guidelines set and shared with the company’s
top management, in addition to identifying
products that have the potential to reach the
established target audience.

When selecting products, the TV _ series
department evaluates the products together
with the Content Department and company
top management working closely with
product marketing in an attempt to find
stories that continue to interest Mediaset’s
historic audience and at the same time try to
broaden its user base.

Specifically, the TV series department
chooses and develops stories that celebrate
the principles and positive values of the
company today and consequently also
reflect the ethical principles of the Group,
never opposing them and thus guaranteeing
a product that all audiences can enjoy.

The considerations on the choice of product
also take into account the option to have
content not suitable for an audience of

minors; in this case, one opts for a shared

choice with the channel that must broadcast
the product.

The Mediaset Group’s TV series department
in Italy constantly strives to improve the
quality of content, broadening the selection
of its suppliers and turning to an ever larger
number of external production companies,
not to mention various screenwriters.

This opening toward the market has led the
Group to receive and assess about 400
original projects each year, a number that is
deemed sufficient to fully satisfy Mediaset’s
needs.

The Mediaset Group also possesses the
know-how and the organisation for selecting
projects and developing the production of
popular drama series. These products are
commissioned from major national partners
and, in some cases, are sold abroad or
leveraged via the web channel, thus
contributing to covering production costs.

In 2019 the first experiments began in co-
financing agreements with SVOD operators
(Amazon and Netflix) on original
productions. Specifically, the agreements
involved partial financing by the Mediaset

Group and availability of the product after an
exclusive initial window for the SVOD
operators.

Through its subsidiaries Medusa, Taodue and
Medset, in the field of entertainment the
Group ensures production and distribution of
films and TV series.

For the creative line of Taodue and Medset,
this is conceived by the Chief Executive
Officer, who through continuous exchange
with Mediaset Group broadcasting line
managers, guarantees the alignment of
content creation activities with the values
and policies established by the organisation
itself.

Likewise, the alignment of the Mediaset
Group’s ethical principles and the quality of
content are guaranteed through’ the
Company Leaders’ and Mediaset Group
broadcasting line managers’ constant
monitoring of the production and creation of
artistic content. Even if not official, this
process is expressed in the modus operandi
employed for products created both
internally and externally.
