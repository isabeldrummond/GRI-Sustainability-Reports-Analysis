developments; it has adopted one of the
leading and most innovative B2C interaction
tools, Zendesk, and the Mapp and
Accengage solutions for handling outbound
communication.

The tool was already active on Infinity from
the launch of the service itself, and has
enabled a relationship with users that both
enhances the experience of using the
services and allows the reporting and
management of technical issues.

It allows various touchpoints to be activated,
including live chat, e-mail and SMS. These
channels are already active on Infinity and
will soon be extended to the other platforms
as well.

Interaction with customers is therefore an
important and effective tool, as user reports
in several cases have helped solve significant
problems in a short time.

Another major user interaction tool
introduced is the Chat Bot. Chat Bots are
programs that simulate a conversation
between a robot and a human being,
incorporating artificial intelligence and

machine learning. This tool interacts directly
by answering user questions; it also performs
pre-defined actions such as rating a
character in a programme.

Digital Business management continuously
monitors the consumption behaviour of
digital users in order to measure the
performance of individual items of content
and reference brands. This monitoring is
performed using data collection tools, such
as Webtrekk.

In order to create a more in-depth perception
of preferences for different contents,
continuous monitoring research is carried out
on the appreciation and mood of users
towards different brands. The continued
adoption of new technologies will give way
to a process to increase awareness
possibilities and interpretation of users’
consumption habits and interests, as well as
proposing content that is more consistent
with user interests through the use of
algorithms (Content Wise).

With particular reference to paid services,
Mediaset constantly monitors customer

satisfaction through such tools as NPS (Net
Promoter Score) and surveys of the entire
customer and ex-customer base, aiming to
identify the main actions for correcting and
developing the service and ensuring the
highest standards of quality for customers.

In line with the Italian companies of the
Mediaset Group, Mediaset Espafia is in
constant contact with its users via various
applications, as well as through the standard
audimetric measurement methodologies”. In
this way users can take part in the
programmes broadcast and make _ their
voices heard, thus influencing and making
major decisions for programmes in the early
evening slot. Moreover, the use of dedicated
spaces on the web platform has led to the
launch of competitions or initiatives to
collect possible content offerings from the
public such as photos or videos. All content
is viewed before publication. In the same
way, users can send _ their opinions,
