3.5 RELATIONS WITH THE
PUBLIC
ADMINISTRATION

When carrying out its business - one well-
established throughout the entire Italian
territory - the Mediaset Group in_ Italy
entertains relationships with a great many
private and public parties.

Precisely in the’ relations with the
aforementioned parties the group has added
an ad hoc article to its Code Of Ethics (also
see par. 1.3 and 3.2) in order to govern the

related activities.’

In addition to prohibiting any illicit conduct
that may involve the Group in its relations
with public bodies, the Code of Ethics also
covers the activities that see the Group
involved in partnerships with public
institutions.

In this case, the Group may support
programmes of public institutions or bodies
aimed at creating public benefit as well as
projects of foundations and associations.

These activities must be performed in full
compliance with the applicable regulations,
the principles set out in the Code of Ethics
and the corporate procedures.

In this area, Mediaset Group is proactive
through the company R.T.I., participating in
European projects financed by the European
Commission which include collaborations

with international partner companies.

On December 22, 2017, the Mediaset Group
adopted ad hoc Organisational Guidelines
that govern the attainment and management
of financial assistance issued by European
public institutions to back the development
of research and innovation projects (for
example on the topic of emerging or future
technologies, saving the environment, etc.).

In 2019, collaboration with the European
Commission was renewed and gave rise to a
series of evening programmes entitled
“Giovane Europa”, broadcast on the
TGCOM24 channel. The rights for the format
created were granted to the European
Commission for its own communication

platforms. The same year saw the production
of the project resulting from the European
Parliament’s 2018 Call for Proposals. It
developed three formats, one in
collaboration with Mediaset Espafa,
broadcast during the year:

-Cavoletti da Bruxelles - 30 episodes -
TGCOM24

-Insieme Juntos - 8 episodes - TGCOM24 /
Canal4 (Spain)

-Dov’é lEuropa? - 4 episodes - FOCUS

In 2019, R.T.I. received a total of 209,402
euros for the above activities, following the
public call for proposals, and 14,800 euros
from the European Commission for the rights
to the content produced.

Through the company Medusa, the Mediaset
Group also operates in the cinema industry,
receiving contributions through support
instruments from public bodies, mainly
national, and the rest from European bodies.

The primary and most important source of
contributions relates to Medusa in_ its

13 Art. 21 “Relations with Public Institutions” requires the Mediaset Group to maintain a collaborative and transparent relationship with the national, community and international public institutions to facilitate dialogue on topics
of specific interest. The relations must be maintained fully in compliance with the current regulations, the principles in the Code of Ethics and the corporate procedures, on the basis of the general criteria of propriety, transparency

and loyalty.
