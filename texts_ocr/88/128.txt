appeal, especially in prime time, compared to
international series and films.

Part of the investment in film production is
made by the subsidiary Medusa Film. All
works are characterised by a complete
broadcasting rights chain, starting from
those relating to cinema.

The latter is the starting point for the
exploitation of the product, as well as the
creation of value through subsequent
exploitation that can be managed by the
Group "non-exclusively" (for example from
market practice, TV on demand, pay per
view) or "exclusively" (SVOD, free).

Also, constant market monitoring is carried
out on film content to identify the main
trends and products of greatest interest (at
international and local level) and to gather
useful information in general to guide the
broadcast offering.

The movie rights acquired in 2019 come from
Italian producers, since the publishing line
established by the Group for Medusa
envisages a focus on Italian cinema, typically
comedy. In 2019, given the strategic business
objective of Medusa, the "core” suppliers

were predominantly Italian. These suppliers,
as executive producers or original producers,
have an almost entirely Italian supply chain.
Film shooting and all subsequent post-
production processes take place in Italy.

The close relations between Medusa Film and
Italian cinema is a guarantee for the selection,
production and dissemination of the best
product, given the constant commitment of
the Medusa Film and its suppliers to
enhancing local artistic and professional
excellence. This commitment must always be
guaranteed to the highest standards in the
industry in order to withstand competition
from foreign products.

Lastly, note that the Organisational Guideline

on the planning, acquisition and
management of movie rights states that
supply contracts for the purchase of film
rights from Italian counterparties must
contain clauses that demand suppliers obtain
approval for public programming. In the
event of non-fulfilment of this clause, Medusa
Film has the right to withdraw from the
existing contract without jeopardy to any
possible claims for damages or, alternatively,
to apply further specific clauses (for example

the reduction of the fee).

In the event of acquisition of movie rights by
foreign counterparties, the contracts drawn
up must contain clauses that provide for
Medusa Film’s right to make the cuts
necessary to obtain approval for public
programming, with prior approval of the
production manager and the supplier.

Acquisition of content

Entertainment - The creation of
entertainment programmes requires the
acquisition of formats, the signing of
executive contracts and the contracting of

artistic resources and collaborators.

About half of the suppliers of the
Entertainment Area are agencies from across
Italy, particularly around Rome and Milan,
which ensure the services of actors,
documentalists, directors, costume
designers, set designers, directors of
photography, choreographers,
commentators, hosts or guests. The
entertainment area together with the artistic
collaborations area (for non-VIPs) and
artistic resources area (for VIPs) provide for

the research and stipulation of contracts with
