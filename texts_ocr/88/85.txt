leadership in the audiovisual industry. That’s
why the New Project Area is always in
contact with the producers and distributors
to stay abreast of what’s new nationally and
internationally.

To evaluate new projects, meetings are held
where the content production team attend as
well as the Production area director and
General Content Director of Mediaset
Espana. During the meetings the different
market trends are taken into consideration in
order to identify quality products and
services in which all subjects representative
of the audience are shown.

Once the project has been approved, the
Antenna Division takes action to develop
programming strategies: identifying the best
premiere dates, establishing the content
marketing strategy, defining the launch
campaigns, setting up the communication
activity being broadcast and more generally
defining all the activities linked to positioning
of the programme in order to get the best
performances.

To ensure the creation of content is in line
with company values and the Code of Ethics,
Mediaset in Spain has defined and

implemented a pyramid control system
where the content generated is evaluated
and monitored constantly.

To improve the dissemination of the content,
the Mediaset Group in Spain has renewed its
platforms, thus managing to disseminate its
products also on Smart TVs, supporting all
advanced DRM formats and_ optimising
performance for mobile devices,
guaranteeing high-definition use and
allowing multi-device use.

More generally, the Mediaset Group in Spain
can broadcast and transmit its signal with a
coverage of 98% of the Spanish population
through 2,916 transmission or broadcasting
centres.

Furthermore, programming is made available
to the audience through the web platform, a
tool that promotes access to audiovisual
content and = allows’ interaction and
monitoring of ratings for the programmes
and series offered through analysis of
comments.

Finally, given the immediacy of the
information delivered with increasing
frequency through social networking sites,

the Mediaset Espafia agency checks its
sources thoroughly. For this purpose, the
following activities have been put in place:

e Weekly broadcasting committee with the

company’s top managers to check the

news.

e Daily broadcasting meetings to review
the content to be broadcast as well as the
content already broadcast, analysing that
which had not been adapted to the set
broadcasting approach in advance.

e Ongoing dialogue among journalists and

area managers to update the information.

e Daily check of the broadcast of content

subject to intellectual property.

e Citations of sources when they are public

and allowed to quote them.

e Confidentiality of sources when required.

For accessibility to content, Mediaset Espana
has maintained its commitment year after
year to render its programming accessible to
individuals with visual or hearing disabilities,
as a tool for the social and cultural

integration of these groups.
