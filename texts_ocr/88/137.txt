Mediaset's vision of corporate social
responsibility. The association focuses
exclusively on achieving social solidarity and
does not distribute, even indirectly, profits
and advances or any funds, savings and
capital throughout the duration of the
Company's existence, unless the destination
or distribution are required by law or in
favour of other non-profit organisations
which, by bylaws or regulations, are part of
the same unitary structure; it uses profits or
advances to perform institutional activities
and anything else directly connected to
them.

Mediafriends is responsible for identifying
and promoting opportunities for exchange
between the world of business and the third
sector, in order to promote mutual growth
and the well-being of society. It also aims to
better coordinate communication skills and
deepen relations in the world of
entertainment and = culture which are
expressed by the three original members in
order to raise public awareness and solicit
donations to fund targeted projects by third
sector NGOs.

The process of identifying the Associations
and projects to be supported through
fundraising activities includes a series of
steps, starting from the identification of a
theme chosen among those envisaged by the
Bylaws and of one or more Associations that
have projects in progress and meet the
budget, diligence and transparency
requirements, verified through Mediaset's
Supplier Certification Office.

The second step involves analysis of the

project estimates provided by the
Association through adequacy analysis of the
costs presented. At this point, if the
evaluation criteria are positive, a contract is
drafted between the Association and
Mediafriends, which regulates the mutual
obligations during the fundraising period and
afterwards when Mediafriends checks the
implementation of the project, in accordance
with the provisions of the contract itself.

The Mediafriends bylaws also state that the
money raised will be allocated to the
Association through the Mediafriends
Advisory Committee, with three positions
expressed by the Members of Mediafriends,
by Mediafriends and by a representative of
the Association. The Advisory Committee
distributes the funds raised, indicating the
time frames and methods.

Mediafriends then checks the reports from
the Association and monitors the progress of
the project funded.
