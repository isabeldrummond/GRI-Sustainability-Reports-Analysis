The Code of Ethics of the Mediaset Group is
also published and appropriately highlighted
in the “Compliance 231” section of the
Mediaset Group's website
(www.mediaset.it), in English and Italian, and
in the “Portale 231” section of the corporate
intranet system.

The Mediaset Group also implements training
activities addressing its Code of Ethics, as
required under the administrative liability
provisions of Legislative Decree 231/01) and
in reference to the "231 Compliance
Programmes” implemented by Group
companies’. According to circumstances and
requirements, training plans are administered
in classroom courses or via special e-learning
modules.

Following its adoption and subsequent
amendments, the Code of Ethics was
distributed to its different recipients
including signatories to employment and

supply contracts and, more generally, to all
parties conducting business relations with
Mediaset Group companies. Contracts with
third parties contain clauses with an explicit
formal reference to the Code of Ethics (as
well as the 231 Compliance Programmes),
stating that failure to observe its provisions
constitutes a breach of contractual
obligations, giving rise to the right to
terminate the legal relationship.

In line with Italy, the Mediaset Group in Spain
implements its own Code of Ethics, which
applies both to the parent Company and its
Subsidiaries. Its latest version was approved
by the Board of Directors in 2019. Mediaset
Espana also implements its own Compliance
Programme, which is analogous to the
programme implemented in Italy. It also
implements a whistle-blowing mechanism
allowing violations of the code to be
reported anonymously.
