3.3 THE INTERNAL
CONTROL AND RISK
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

As an integral part of its Internal Control and
Risk Management System, the Mediaset
Group has adopted a Risk Management
model, both in Italy and in Spain, in order to
be able to respond better to the risks to
which it is structurally exposed. The Group
has adopted the
Management (ERM) methodology, already

Enterprise Risk

identified as the benchmark methodology in
the Guidelines for the Internal Control and
Risk Management System issued by the
Board of Directors, with effect from 2008
and regularly updated by the Board of
Directors. It was last updated at the meeting
of 20 December 2016.

The ERM model identifies the following types
of risk factors which may be important from
a perspective of sustainability over the
medium and long terms:

1. External and industry sector risks, which
are linked to the economic cycle, to the
evolution of the intermediate and end
markets of reference (consisting of the

demand for the consumption of
audiovisual content and entertainment
and demand for advertising slots) and to
the evolution of the competition and
regulatory environment;

2. The risks connected with the strategic
approaches and policies adopted and the
management of the main “operational”
processes linked to the management, also
on a progressive basis (for example
through partnerships and alliances) of the
broadcasting, commercial, technical and
infrastructure models used to coordinate
and manage production inputs and
strategic assets (managerial personnel,
content and distribution network)
employed in the core business of
producing and broadcasting the

television offering, also in relation to

aspects of risk linked to the Company's
reputation and social responsibility;

3. Financial risks connected to the
management of financing needs and
interest and exchange rate fluctuations;

4. Risks connected to the management of
legal disputes;

5. Risks related to environmental policies;

6. Risks
Governance.

connected to Corporate

The principal sources of risk and uncertainty
in the ESG (Environmental, Social and
Governance) spheres and of relevance to the
Group are indicated below, together with a
description of their nature and_ the
management/mitigation measures

implemented by management.

Risks connected with reputation and
relations with stakeholders

One of the Mediaset Group’s key strategic
objectives is the ability to maintain and
increase content innovation and brand value
perception over time in keeping with the
development of its business model. In
relation to this objective, there is a risk of
establishing broadcasting and
communications strategies and_ initiatives
aimed at the financial market and the public
that could have an adverse impact on the
perception of the Mediaset brand. This risk is
primarily monitored via constant supervision
designed to ensure full oversight of certain
processes, and in particular:
