4.2 RESPONSIBLE
ADVERTISING AND
MARKETING

The Mediaset Group operates through two
fully-owned advertising sales agencies in
Italy: Publitalia '80, the sales house that
exclusively serves the free-to-air Mediaset
networks; and Digitalia '08, the sales house
specialised in selling advertising space on the
pay-TV distribution platform.

The Group also owns a 50% interest in
Mediamond, a joint-venture with Mondadori,
which sells advertising space on the Mediaset
Group websites and radio, on Mondadori
websites, and via third-party publishers.

The Group's advertising is based on the
strategies and commercial policies from
various periods of the year which define the
sales methods to investors for all advertising

spaces on Mediaset television channels
(general-interest and specific).

Advertising sales take place through
different formats:

e Display advertising: commercials during
advertising breaks within or adjacent to
programmes;

e Sponsored programmes (such as weather

forecasts);

e Long video: 40-60-90-second videos
created for the client and aiming to
explain the product in greater depth than
a classic commercial;

e Short format characterised by the
prestigious position and the graphics
frame (Top, Best last position, Brand
video);

e Animated overlays in programs Cinlogo).

The main forms of display advertising sales
are organised by programme and by sets of
commercials (target modules), while a
relative price list is created for special
positions within commercial breaks (very
first, first, second and last).

Another way of advertising and _ selling
products via television is product placement.
This form of advertising sales takes place
through the definition and creation of
projects in collaboration with the client.
There are two forms available: product
insertion in programmes or the construction
of programmes fully financed by the client.

From an internal control point of view, the
Group takes special care to select which
advertising campaigns are broadcast. To this
end, the main criterion is compliance with
current legislation on advertising.

Compliance verification is applied in full
respect for the advertiser’s autonomy in
creative and communication choices and is
aimed at protecting the company (as well as
the advertiser) with respect to the legal
status of the communication to be broadcast.
This is expressed in the — preliminary
assessment of what might be the "critical”
elements of the message (as well as in the
identification, where possible, of the actions
necessary to ensure that the advertising
complies with the rules).

These control procedures aim to avoid any
complaints that could lead to the early
