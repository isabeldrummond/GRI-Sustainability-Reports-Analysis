We would highlight over 800 radio spots
broadcast in 2019 by the various Mediaset
Group radio stations to support social
initiatives. Purely by way of example, we
might mention the following: “Mediaset ha a
cuore il tuo futuro”, “Never give up”, “A
fianco del coraggio”, “AIRC Cioccolatini della
ricerca”, “Assisi con il cuore”, “Fondazione
Sic” etc.

On the web, a page dedicated to the project
was developed within the MediasetPlay site.
In addition to gathering together all the
material produced for the campaigns in
chronological order, the aim of the dedicated
space is to publicise brand-new contributions
and in-depth information produced
specifically for every topic focused on. It’s a
genuine archive, always up to date and open
to consultation at any time, so that the
contemporary nature of the problems

addressed remains present.

The entire project attracted institutional
attention and interest. In particular, both
campaigns produced were presented to the
relevant Ministries (the Ministry of Education,
University and Research and Ministry of
Health), which expressed a great deal of

appreciation for the initiative and its quality
of execution.

But “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” is more
han asystem for raising awareness of broad-
ranging national issues. It also involves
concrete action for sustainability within the
company. In productions with third parties,
or example, all plastic material was
eliminated from sets and replaced with
branded metal flasks and compostable items.

This is because “caring about the future” isn’t
merely a catchphrase but a way of existing,
hinking and acting.

We wish to highlight a new cross-media
campaign from Mediaset called “Pensa,

 

prima di scrivere” to raise social awareness in
connection with the national Anti-Bullying
and Cyberbullying Day. It began in the early
months of 2020.

We also wish to stress that sponsorship of
fundraisers for public and private bodies
(recognised by the state) is all certified by
government associations (Civil Protection for
Italy and AGIRE for the world). Many of these
activities are also carried out through the
support of Mediafriends, a non-profit

organisation founded in 2003 as a tangible
expression of Mediaset's vision of corporate
social responsibility.

It is within this scenario that the Group takes
to the field alongside Mediafriends and
Fabbrica del Sorriso through its own
agencies, in daytime packages on generalist
networks or on TGCOM24. Particular visibility
is given to the projects to which Fabbrica del
Sorriso is committed, not only upon
presentation and during fundraising but also
when the project is run and for the results
from the initiative.

Publitalia'80 contributes to the social
activities of the Mediaset Group through
Mediafriends, providing advertising space
that is used to promote fundraising mainly to
support the identified charity initiatives. In
addition to this, Publitalia'8O0 reserves some
advertising space to initiatives that support
scientific research, training and cultural
activities.

Around 6,200 spots were broadcast in the
year, with contributions free of charge from
some of the main faces in the Group's artistic
landscape.
