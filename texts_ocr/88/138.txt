reform of the third sector contained in Law
no. 106 of 6 June 2016), Mediafriends' lawyers
are monitoring the situation of the
implementation decrees that should lead to
the introduction of this register.

Over the years, Mediafriends has supported
numerous TV and other events to raise funds
for the projects of non-profit associations.
The most notable of these is Fabbrica del
sorriso (the smile factory). Over 14 years of
activity, over 72 million euros have been
raised and_ distributed, allowing 165
associations to implement 289 charity
projects in Italy and around the world.

To do this, Mediafriends called on the close
collaboration with Mediaset. Firstly,
Mediafriends relies on the continuous work of
five Mediaset employees, who design events
and coordinate with both external bodies
(third sector, institutions, etc.) and the

departments within the company.

Fundraising initiatives and activities follow
one after another throughout the year:
fundraising events including through SMS
donations, field initiatives in collaboration
with recipient groups and editorial events
such as the “L'Ottocento - l’arte italiana tra

Hayez e Segantini” exhibition at the San
Domenico museum complex in Forli. These
events were promoted on television and
online with the collaboration of the various
Mediaset Group structures: the presentation
of programme projects with services created
by journalists in the News Department,
fundraising spaces with commercials created
by the Creative Department, presence in
programs with the collaboration of the
production structures of the Entertainment,
News, Sport and Publitalia’8O Departments.
On some special episodes of the “Caduta
Libera” game show on Canale5, hosted by
Gerry Scotti, the prize money was donated to
the fundraiser. Together with Publitalia’80,
Mediafriends manages a pool of social
communications, offering space free of
charge for the broadcasting of social
infomercials and creating times dedicated to
social issues within its programme schedule.

Lastly, the Mediafriends site and
Mediafriends slot on the TGCOM24 site, as
well as and the Facebook Page of Fabbrica
del Sorriso, hosted campaigns for charities
and numerous videos produced on some of

the most important social issues.

More specifically, the Fabbrica del Sorriso

fundraising project which began in 2018
continued in the first part of 2019, for four
associations: Amref, Mission Bambini,
Comunita di Sant’Egidio and A _ regola
d’Arte. The fundraiser closed at the end of
June at a total of €1,046,276.00. The
projects funded relate to issues such as
poverty, disadvantage and marginalisation in
taly and around the world.

The innovative “A Regola d’Arte” (ARdA)
project, in particular, is aimed towards
disadvantaged Italian and foreign children
iving in the suburbs of Italian cities and seeks
to promote integration and social
development through music and rugby.
Rugby provides models for behaviour (unity,
oyalty, respect, managing aggression), while
music, in addition to building a grand Italian

 

heritage, provides the possibility of cultural
growth to those who, for reasons not linked
to their merits, would not have the
opportunity to access it. After consolidating
and expanding this initiative in 2016, it was
continued in 2018 and has seen more
extensive implementation. Currently, it
entails the funding and supervision by
Mediafriends of 8 ARdA centres: two schools
Cin the Baggio and Via Dolci districts), church
facilities (in the Giambellino district) and
