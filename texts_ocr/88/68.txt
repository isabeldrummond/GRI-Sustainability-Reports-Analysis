ANTI-CORRUPTION AND UNFAIR
COMPETITION

The topic of active and passive corruption is
first and foremost overseen within the scope
of the Code of Ethics of the Mediaset Group
through specific provisions that define

general principles on the topic.'®

Furthermore, considering the constant
strengthening of the fight against public and
private corruption, both internationally and
nationally, in view of legislators’ particular
focus on combating corruptive practices, the
Mediaset Group has decided to align itself
with industry best practices to combat
corruption, adopting a Group policy in Italy
called “General Anti-corruption Guidelines”
which is included in the Compliance
Programmes pursuant to Legislative Decree
231 of the companies that have them.

This policy offers a systematic framework of
reference on the topic of prohibition of
corrupt practices for Mediaset group

companies, providing a summary of the
ethical and conduct rules that must be
strictly adhered to in order to keep
illegitimate or incorrect conduct from
occurring, and to follow the provisions set
forth by the current regulations in the area of
anti-corruption as well as the principles and
values in the Code of Ethics, Compliance
Programmes pursuant to Legislative Decree
231 and corporate procedures currently in
effect.

In this policy, the Mediaset Group companies
deplore and condemn any and all corrupt
behaviour or activity including, without
limitation, illegitimate favouritism, collusion,
solicitations - made directly and/or through
third parties - for personal benefits of any
kind for themselves or for others.

Moreover, it is required that any party acting
in the name or on behalf of Mediaset Group
companies in business relationships with
public or private entities must always and in
all circumstances behave in an_ ethical

manner according to the law and in full
compliance with the aforementioned
principles.

Based on the results of the activities
designed to identify risks within Mediaset
Group companies, this policy identifies the
main areas of remotely relevant activities
identified as being “at risk”, with specific
reference to the possible commission of
crimes of public and private corruption. This
refers to the main areas (for example
management of relations with public bodies
and institutions, the purchase of goods and
services, management of gifts, entertainment
expenses, sponsorships and_ donations,
selection and hiring of personnel, etc.) in the
sphere where it is best to pay special
attention to issues concerning corporate
compliance, specifically in relation to
prevention and fighting corrupt practices.
Regarding these areas identified as being “at
risk”, each Mediaset Group company has
defined designated controls (general and
specific), adopting, when necessary,

15 The Group's Code of Ethics is implemented by all Group companies except for the Mediaset Group in Spain, which operates its own code based on the parent Company's.

The new Code of Ethics, adopted by Mediaset S.p.A. and its subsidiaries in 2019, has a specific new article dedicated to preventing corruption with the aim of setting out a systematic reference system for preventing corrupt
practices for Mediaset Group companies. Specifically, it provides for a summary of the ethical and conduct rules that Addressees must strictly adhere to in order to follow the provisions set forth by the current regulations.
Article 20 (Protection of competition) sets out: “The Mediaset Group recognises fair, free and honest competition as a decisive factor for market growth as well as constant improvement of the business. It therefore abstains
from conduct that encourages dealings to its own advantage in violation of current regulations. The Mediaset Group promotes training activity to encourage competition, standards and regulations to protect competition and

ensure that they are observed.”
