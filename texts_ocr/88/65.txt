capacity as producer. Thanks to its title, the
company was able to apply to obtain
percentage contributions on the general
national box office revenue admitted to
“legal benefits”. Up until 31/12/2016 these
contributions were therefore automatically
calculated as a percentage of the revenue
measured by the SIAE in the first 18 months
after the first public projection.

Law No. 220 of 14 November 2016, with
“cinema and _ audiovisual regulations”,
introduced new cinema and audiovisual
support instruments. As of 1 January 2017, it
also abrogated the system of incentives
envisaged and governed by Legislative
Decree No. 28 of 22 January 2004 and
subsequent amendments.

The new support instruments still include
automatic contributions for the production

 

and distribution of cinematographic works,
but the amount of these contributions is
calculated on the basis of the financial,
cultural and artistic results and public
distribution of the work nationally and
internationally. The Decree of the Director
General, issued on 29 May 2019, established
the amount of automatic contributions due
to each company for each work in the

reference year, with respect to the films
produced by Medusa and released in 2017.

With respect to the reinvestment of these
contributions, the Decree of the Director
General was issued on 13 December 2019
with a description of the reinvestment
methods for these contributions, and since
27 January 2020 the forms have been
available on the platform dedicated to

submitting applications.

For films produced and released in the 2018
calendar year, the window for initiating the
formal application procedure to the Ministry
of Cultural Heritage and Activities opened at
the end of December 2019 and will close on
17 February 2020. There is still no window
available for films produced and released in
the 2019 calendar year.

Another support instrument is bound up with
Medusa’s business itself, i.e. the distribution
of films in cinemas and the activity of
advertising them. This considered, the
Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Tourism
offers tax credits, applying variable
percentages to costs incurred.
