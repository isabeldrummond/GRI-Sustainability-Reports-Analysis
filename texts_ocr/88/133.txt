Digital Communication and Sales
Management reached its thirty-second year.

The Master's in Journalism is the training
course for professional journalists, combining
the communications and __ information
capabilities of IULM University and Mediaset.

It is a professional training course which is
recognised by the National Association of
Journalists as the equivalent of an
apprenticeship. The objective of this Master's
course is to give fledgling journalists the
professional armoury of cultural and
multimedia skills they need to access any
journalistic speciality and produce
multimedia content suitable for all kinds of
communication media. The effectiveness of
the courses is validated by the Joint

Scientific Committee.

There is also a technology workshop run
using professionals made available by
Mediaset. It stands out among _ italian
journalism courses as the only one of its kind.

In 2019, ten students on the IULM Master's in
Journalism were welcomed to internships in
Mediaset agencies (TV, website and radio): 7
for 2 months and 3 for 3 months.

The Mediaset Group also offers its
experience and professionalism via the
Master's in Marketing, Digital Communication
and Sales Management, which was
established in 1988 by Publitalia’80.

The Master's in Marketing, Digital
Communication and Sales Management is a
13-month postgraduate course with lectures
and internship and limited admission,
targeted at graduates who have decided to
start their professional future in the field of
marketing, trade marketing, sales and digital
communications.

Through the two editions launched in 2019
(January-April and September-December),
the Master's offered its 75 participants 153
course days for a total of 1,071 hours of
training; with reference to the January-April
2019 edition, the 39 participants were able to
approach the world of work through
participation in a total of 140 days of
internship, a total of 1,120 hours. At the end
of this internship period, all graduates were
able to find a stable job.

The companies that collaborate on this
initiative contribute with teaching and
practical sessions and provide a reference

point for the labour market as an employer,
as well as elements that enable the ongoing
updating of the training programme. As a
result, the Master's course always acts as an
up-to-date "bridge” between Universities
and the Company.

This takes place thanks to teaching staff from
leading Italian and international universities
and contributions from managers in key roles
within Italian and multinational companies.

The Master's is the most long-lasting
experiment in collaboration among
the universities of Milan. From the beginning
of the initiative, the Rectors of six Milanese
universities signed up to it, taking part in the

Chairpersons’ Committee:
