the Group's systems (narrow
measurements), in order to ensure
compliance with the electromagnetic
emission threshold imposed by current
legislation. Where anomalies were
detected,
technicians were promptly alerted to

installers/maintenance

resolve them.

In 2019, financial penalties were not imposed
and 4 compliance reductions were
implemented (following orders and
warnings) at 8 sites. The ARPAs identified
non-compliance with the envisaged attention
thresholds due to multiple exposure. This
involved 13 managed systems and others
belonging to third parties (here resolution
may mean involving the tower operator), out
of a total of around 2000 systems.

The appointed RadioMediaset Office also
gathers the data for drawing up the Risk
Assessment Document, including the
electromagnetic field levels, which allow
appropriate interventions for remedying the
most important issues to be identified and
developed. 744 monitoring operations were
performed for this purpose in 2019.

There were no risks to station workers since
the electromagnetic levels detected are
completely within the thresholds prescribed
by law.

In any case, in an effort to further reduce risk,
the power of the transmitting plants is
reduced during any work at height on the
pylon/pole, thus keeping the exposure of
workers to electromagnetic fields to a

minimum.
