qualitative assessments and assessments of
the competitive context, with the aim of
offering the best product to the end user.

The same reporting is also used on a B2B
level as a valid tool for advertising investors;
the investors are thus able to understand the
true potential of a product and its ability to
speak to the target audience of the
advertisers.

The Group radio channels collect feedback
and comments from listeners via messaging
(SMS and WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram,
Twitter, voice mail, direct contact via the

 

radio channel phone number) and in some
cases users are even contacted to give their
opinions live on air. The feedback collected
may concern topics discussed on the air, the
selection of music tracks, or guest speaker
interventions during live broadcasts. To
guarantee users’ privacy, the messaging
systems hide the mobile telephone numbers
of listeners, who can only be contacted by
the people employed in the company for that
purpose.

The radio sector also has surveys on public
appreciation, through TER (Tavolo editori
radio) and in collaboration with Gfk, lpsos

and Doxa. The surveys consider the listening
figures (on an average day, seven days and
average quarter of an hour).
