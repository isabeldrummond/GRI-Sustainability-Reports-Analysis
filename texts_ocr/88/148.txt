7.3. WASTE MANAGEMENT

In order to minimise its impact on the local
territory, the Mediaset Group, including
foreign investee companies, constantly
monitors its consumption of raw materials

and the waste produced by its activities.

The Group mainly produces waste connected
to its specific activity, such as mixed
packaging materials, toner, electrical and
electronic equipment and bulky waste (e.g.
sets), and hazardous waste composed of
materials from ordinary maintenance
activities (e.g. neon lights and batteries).
Lastly, it is worth mentioning the possible
production of hazardous waste due to the

hospital service.

All refuse produced is managed in
compliance with current regulations on the
environment (Legislative Decree 152/2006)
and waste collection is managed using
appropriate bins that have been approved

for hazardous waste.

The Mediaset Group also adopts oversight
activities on the correct administrative and
legal management of the refuse through the
supervision of the transport process, in close

coordination with the suppliers and in
compliance with the law.

The verification of the authorisations and the
administrative management of the waste for
all premises that are part of the Cologno
Monzese headquarters are carried out using
specific software (ECOSWEB).

It should also be noted that the separate
collection of urban waste has always been
present within the company.

The Group produced approximately 1,800
tonnes of waste in 2019. In particular,
hazardous waste represents around 1% of the
total waste produced, with the rest non-
hazardous. An increase in non-hazardous
waste was recorded compared to 2018,
mostly in the "mixed packaging” and "bulky
waste” categories due to organisational
changes that occurred during the year.

The Mediaset Group Espaifia monitors the
consumption of paper, CDs and toners in all
focuses

its offices. This monitoring

specifically on the Fuencarral and Villaviciosa
