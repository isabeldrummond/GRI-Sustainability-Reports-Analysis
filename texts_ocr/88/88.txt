Pubblicita) Progresso promotes _ training
initiatives on social communication at
leading Italian universities; it sponsors
events, exhibitions and initiatives dedicated
to important social issues; it sponsors social
communication campaigns carried out by
non-profit organisations; and it holds the
Festival of Social Communication for training
and public educational purposes. In addition
to paying a membership fee, the sponsoring
members provide their work free of charge
for the implementation of the Foundation’s
activities.

Every year, Pubblicita Progresso draws the
attention of the authorities and public
opinion to create greater awareness on a
specific theme by implementing
communication campaigns using
contributions from promoting partners; by
way of example, past themes have included
campaigns on anti-smoking, organ donation,
gender equality, anti-racism, sustainability

and volunteer work.

In terms of product innovation, Publitalia '80
has created a new internal structure for the
research and development of exploiting
internet-connected TVs to offer the market

new advertising products.

The most significant developments are based
on the analysis and use of Big Data; this
activity offers increasingly targeted and
effective advertising products.

An example of this is the new ADD+PLUS and
ADD+OVER_ formats which allow the
segmentation of the audience and more in-
depth content depending on the product
advertised through mini-websites accessible
via interaction with internet-connected TV;
these cases enable a report revealing the
results of the campaigns in detail.

The Mediaset Group in Spain believes that
the responsible emission and management of
advertising are both fundamental elements
of the business and_ has_ therefore
implemented specific management and
control mechanisms.

Publiespaha S.A.U. manages the Group's
advertising activities in strict compliance
with the applicable legislation and with the
specific guidelines defined by the
Association for the Self-Regulation of
Commercial Communication, which the
company has been part of since 1995.

In 2019 these Guidelines were enhanced, in
compliance with the new _ European
standards, with indications concerning
“environmental protection” and a new Code
of Ethics for the technology sector.

In recent years, Publiespafia S.A.U. undertook
an internal reorganisation process to create
as uniform a structure as possible with the
Directorate-General for Contents; the central
figure in this reorganisation is the Director-
General, who is’ responsible for the
management and sale of advertising and
constantly works in close liaison with the
Chief Executive Officer.

For the purposes of the internal supervisory
system, a commercial policy has been
implemented which allows improved
monitoring of the advertising content
prepared. This is examined and monitored
weekly by three Directorates General (Sales,
Digital Media, Marketing, Operation and Sale
services), who monitor the correct
broadcasting of the content.

These Directorates work in close
collaboration with the Group Legal
Department.
