The Master's, now in its thirty-second edition,
has to date educated more than 1,000
graduates, many of whom now hold top
management positions.

The course is accredited by ASFOR, the
Italian Association for Management

Education, as a specialist Master's course.

Furthermore, the Mediaset Group has had
ongoing collaborations with leading Italian
universities for some years now, offering
students of the main faculties opportunities
for integrated curricular internships to
complete their studies. During _ their
internship experience, the young
undergraduates are given the opportunity to
experience the world of work while building
professional relationships, interfacing with
the organisational dynamics of the company
and using the knowledge acquired during
their studies to further hone the skills and

 

experiences that will facilitate their entry into
the labour market.

INITIATIVES AIMED AT
THE COMMUNITY

Mediaset agencies receive daily information
on philanthropic activities, events and

initiatives by non-profit organisations and
charitable associations for the protection and
support of ethnic minorities, voluntary
groups, and institutions of medical research.

The “Mediaset ha a cuore il futuro” (Mediaset
cares about the future) initiative is a concrete
way of putting Mediaset’s skills and
communicative power at the service of
society.

Social communication campaigns that
operate according to an_ integrated
multimedia scheme featuring TV and radio
advertising as well as digital and social media
coverage address issues’ of national
importance. These may relate to national
emergencies or problems that are sometimes
neglected. This lends continuity and power
to the commitment that the company
already expresses through its programmes.

The project began in September 2019 with a
campaign to raise awareness of school
leavers, with more than 750 TV broadcasts
on all of the Group's generalist and thematic
networks, 23 million web impressions,
reports on the subject by TG4, Studio Aperto
and an in-depth report on Tgcom24. A

documentary on the subject is also being
produced, by the InfinityLab team.

October is traditionally dedicated to
prevention, and this October saw a campaign
to raise awareness of breast cancer
prevention. There were a total of 800 TV
broadcasts and 9 million web impressions, as
well as mentions on Forum and Mattino
Cinque, with in-depth reports on the topic
and guests linked to the campaign, and
reports on Studio Aperto and Tgcom24. The
Mediaset Tower turned pink for the occasion,
to symbolise life and prevention, and
sculptor Stefano Rossetti produced a
dedicated artwork which was on display for
a week in Piazza Leonardo da Vinci, Milan.

Radio too plays an important role in this new
institutional communication campaign from
Mediaset: for the two campaigns running in
2019, all of the Group's broadcasters (Radio
105, Virgin Radio, Radio 101, Radio Monte
Carlo and Radio Subasio) not only broadcast
radio spots but also reserved time for in-
depth exploration of the phenomenon of
school leavers and promoting prevention,
with contributions from many hosts within
the various programmes.
