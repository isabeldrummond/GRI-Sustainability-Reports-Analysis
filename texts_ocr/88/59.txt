Risks related to environmental policies

In Italy, exposure to electrical, magnetic and
electromagnetic fields is governed by Italian
Framework Law no. 36 of 2001 and Italian
Presidential Decree of the Council of
Ministers of 8/7/2003, which set limits on
exposure of the population to electrical,
magnetic and electromagnetic fields with a
frequency ranging from between 100 kHz to

300 GHz.

The exposure limit is the value of the

electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic
field, regarded as the emission value, set to
protect health against severe effects, which
must not be exceeded under any condition of

exposure of the population and workers.

The attention value is the value of the

electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic

field, regarded as the emission value, which

must not be exceeded in residential areas,
schools and places of extended stay.

The quality goals are:

e location criteria, urban planning

standards, requirements and incentives
best

for the use of the available

technologies, as indicated in regional
laws;
e the electrical, magnetic and

electromagnetic field values, set by the
government for the progressive

mitigation of exposure to those fields.

Despite widespread concerns among the

resulting from exposure to weak
electromagnetic fields. Therefore
compliance with the exposure _ limits

recommended by domestic and international
guidelines enables monitoring of the risks of
exposure to electromagnetic fields which

may be harmful to health.

Moreover, the limits under Italian regulations
are up to 100 times lower than those set by
the International Commission on Non
lonizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and

applied in the rest of Europe.

The
transmission equipment and adhering to

critical factors for constructing

legal limits are:

e the need to emit high power levels;

e the difficulty of erecting tall towers for the

installation of transmission antennas;
