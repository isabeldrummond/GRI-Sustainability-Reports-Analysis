background” levels and the impact of that
individual plant. 38The reference standards
for the Electromagnetic Impact Analysis are
those reported in Law 36/2001 and include
the maximum permitted levels to which the
population can be subjected.

Furthermore, while complying with
regulatory limits, Elettronica  Industriale
S.p.A. continuously assesses any specific
provisions set by individual municipalities as
well as any indications of any provincial, state
and international location plans for

transmission sites.

As regards the assessment of the overall
impact of the transmission sites (within
which Elettronica Industriale S.p.A. plants
also operate), the role of the ARPA
departmental agencies (Regional Agency for
Environment Protection) must also be taken
into consideration, which is responsible for
monitoring activities through periodic
analysis and sampling of the plants, with
particular attention to more prone units of
the company.

38 The maximum exposure limits allowed by current legislation are 6 V/m in homes and related outbuildings and 20 V/m in public places (see also par. 3.3)

As part of managing relations with public
bodies, Elettronica Industriale S.p.A. always
provides absolute availability for inspections
and collaborates with the ARPA, even in a
preventive manner, using comparison
activities during meetings with those public
bodies.

n the next three years, following the
ransition to new frequencies caused by the
release of the '700 band for telephones, new
applications must be made to authorise all
plants, which will have to comply with the
new frequency allocation plan. This will result
in further analysis of the electromagnetic

 

ields envisaged by the applicants and the

Regional Environmental Protection
Agencies. The total number of plants
envisaged by the new PNAF (national
frequency allocation plan) will be lower than
the current number of plants in operation,
with a resulting decrease in the
electromagnetic impact. The most sensitive
plants have been monitored in recent years
by the regional agencies (ARPAs) without
penalties being imposed on Mediaset. The
new PNAF means that a reduction in the

number of plants results in a further overall

reduction in magnetic fields. Mediaset's
plants will have an electromagnetic impact
even more comfortably within the legal limits
in the future.

In 2019, the Regional Environmental
Protection Agencies performed two checks
on critical stations in terms of high power
transmission or the proximity of housing to
the transmission equipment. In both cases,
the Group's plants proved compliant with the
current regulations on protecting the
population from electromagnetic fields.

The equipment managed by the
RadioMediaset company is generally housed

at stations that it does not own.

The appointed RadioMediaset Office
independently, or with the support of
specialist companies and/or the tower
operator itself, provided with the technical
documentation necessary, draws up the
applications to present to the _ local
authorities for authorisation to change
existing equipment and/or activate new
equipment.
