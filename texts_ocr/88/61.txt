3.4 DATA PROTECTION AND
PRIVACY

The protection of privacy and the data and
information pertaining to clients and
subscribers is one of the principal concerns
of the Mediaset Group.

The Group has prepared a special set of
Organisational Guidelines on Information
Security Policy, management of personal
data and the protection of data. These
activities observe the following principles:

e compliance with national and
international legal requirements, with
particular reference to Legislative Decree
231/2001, L.262/2005 on the protection
of savings and_ financial markets
regulations, and the European Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 on the processing of
personal data.

e safeguards on adequate measures of
protection of data against threats,
including cybersecurity; these measures

are identified in accordance with the level
of risk associated with the loss of
confidentiality, integrity and availability of
information. This protection must also be
guaranteed in regard to relations with
third parties.

e protection of data against unauthorised
access, while ensuring accessibility for
legitimate purposes, with a_ suitable
degree of traceability.

A cyber risk assessment process has also
been implemented, and _has_ recently
identified the principal areas of IT risk for the
Mediaset Group as well as the measures best
suited to resisting threats and mitigating
residual risk.

Among the most important initiatives
undertaken is the creation of a Security
Operation Centre (SOC). The duties of the
SOC include an early warning mechanism
which analyses the correlation between
accesses to information systems and the
respective alarms so that security can be
managed preventively, identifying
vulnerabilities in network components and
tracing anomalous or dangerous activity

(unauthorised exploration of the network,

access to systems, spreading of viruses,
general attacks).

On 25 May 2018, European Regulation
679/2016 (a.k.a. the GDPR) on the protection
of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free
movement of such data took effect. The
Mediaset Group - in observance of the
regulations in force (especially the European
Regulation, Legislative Decree No. 196 of 30
June 2003 “Personal Data Protection Code”
and national privacy regulations) - has
adopted a compliance programme for
privacy management (“Privacy Compliance
Programme”) with the aim of optimising
company processes linked to personal data
protection.

Mediaset has also issued an Organisational
Guideline on data breaches that accidentally
or unlawfully result in destruction, loss,
alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access
to personal data. The data’ breach
management plan was prepared in order to
implement, where necessary, the action plan
and any notification of the Supervisory
Authority within 72 hours of identification of
the breach and communicate the breach to
the data subject should the rights and
