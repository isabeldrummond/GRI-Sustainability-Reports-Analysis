ear stakeholder,

In 2019 too, Mediaset has worked with
determination in accordance with _ its
guidelines, focusing on two. overarching
themes:

- presence and strengthening of the model
of commercial TV broadcaster evolving
towards a new digital paradigm in both
Italy and Spain

- launching a corporate’ restructuring
project directed towards creating a
European holding company to make the
business model even more sustainable in
the new global competitive scenario.

Let’s look at the results obtained within the

 

first overarching theme: reinforcing the core

 

business.

We were dealing with an unstable economic
context and_ political situations that
negatively affected the advertising market in
both Italy and Spain. In this context, we
defended and protected our market shares,

continuing to invest in the product and in
technological innovation to ensure ever
increasing coverage of the main advertising
targets. The quantity and quality of our
broadcast offering spelt success in terms of
audience figures, both conventional linear -
with our generalist networks, the extensive
offering of free-to-air and pay channels and
varied radio offering - and through our digital
on-demand offering, unrivalled in terms of
original content provided online both via
browser and through dedicated apps on
smartphones, tablets, games consoles and
internet-connected TVs.

Having completed the Digital Transformation
which began with the decision in the
preceding financial year, we end 2019 with
positive economic results that allow us to
look to 2020 with renewed confidence,
Despite an economic situation which is still
uncertain and recently affected by fears of
further unexpected slowdown connected to
the coronavirus emergency, to which our
Group responded rapidly. We _ acted
immediately to safeguard the health of our
employees, collaborators and_ suppliers,
simultaneously adopting the actions required
to guarantee continuous operation. It is in
precisely this extremely delicate phase,

which is now severely testing our habits and
affecting the social conduct of the public,
that we perceive our responsibilities all the
more, both as broadcasters that inform and
as an economic reality capable of stimulating
the market. Generalist television is now an
authoritative, balanced point of reference for
communicating news and in-depth
information - as well as offering
entertainment and light relief - but it is alsoa
fundamental lever for the — brand’s
institutional communication strategies and
plans.

We now come to the results for the second

 

overarching theme: international

development.

 

As we said, we concentrated with great
determination on new international
development projects: financial investment
in the major German broadcaster
ProsiebenSatl and the launch of the MFE-
MediaForEurope business plan, which we are
planning on finalising in 2020 as the first step
towards broader pan-European integration.
We are sure that this integration will permit
perfect alignment of interests between all
shareholders and stakeholders in the new

holding company, and will promote the
