emphasises the main stories and current
events;

e Tg4, with a complete restyling of the
evening news as of September 2018,

e Sport Mediaset covers sports events and
commentary and was set up in August

Studio Aperto, Tg4 and Sport Mediaset all
reference the News Mediaset agency for
supply of content. The agency was set up in
March 2010 and guarantees uniformity and
completeness of information.

A new transition occurred in June 2019: six
agencies (TG4, Studio Aperto, Tgcom24,
Sport Mediaset, Pagina 101 and RMC) were
closed and converted into brands. The
Agency ceased merely to be a provider of
reports for the agencies and became a
producer and distributor of multi-platform
content through its brands.

productions represent another key element

in the Mediaset network information
structure, from the Videonews agency, which

Rovescio”, “Fuori dal coro”, as well as the
evergreen “Quarto grado”, which has
always been a leading product for the
network;
