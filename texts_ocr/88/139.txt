three youth centres (Barrios, Barona district;
La Strada, Trecca district; Ermanno Olmi,
Baggio district) in Milan, and the centres of
Palermo in collaboration with Ciai Onlus and
L’Aquila with Action Aid. The “A Regola
d’Arte (ARdA) project expanded in the
autumn of 2019 with the opening of a centre
at the Murialdo church facilities in Naples, in
the Luzzati district.

A total of more than 300 children are on the
rugby and music courses and take part in
healthy, formative activities. The activity at
the centres in Milan was also documented in
a book of photo illustrations, “Territori di
Frontiera”, published by Mimesis and
produced by Mediafriends with the Brera
Academy. The book describes the meeting of
the students on the Brera photography and
painting course with the young people taking
part in the A Regola d’Arte project. The book
is distributed online and was presented in an
event at the Brera Academy.

In the spring of 2019, Mediafriends decided to
support an awareness-raising and

fundraising campaign organised in
partnership with the TMA Group social
cooperative. Mediafriends dealt with all

television and radio communication and

promoted a football event in Fano together
with the Italian National Singers’ Team. The
proceeds went to the project, which uses
water as a means to stimulate emotional,
sensory and motor activity in people with
communication disorders and autism, to
promote meaningful relationships. At the
same time, TMA Group launched a charity
number, which was promoted on Mediaset
networks, and 11 events in different pools all
over the country. More than 6600 people
took part in the initiative’s national events,
raising a total of €141,077.

Mediafriends also dedicated the Fabbrica del
Sorriso’'s autumn event to an Associazione
Italiana Persone Down - Livorno project
aiming to provide work experience for young
people with disabilities, in order to help them
be independent, ensure a_ future for
themselves and become an asset to society.
A plan of broadcasting slots in Mediaset
network programmes was developed
alongside a TV communication campaign,
promoting a charity number and book of
children’s stories with a percentage of the
proceeds and copyright fees going to the
project. The fundraiser closed on 31
December 2019 in the New Year's concert
broadcast on Canale 5.

With a team of academics from the IULM
University of Language and Communication
in Milan supervised by Prof. Guido di Fraia,
Mediafriends organised the “Essere Brand,
ma uscire dal trend” conference: through the
“Spot e Post del Terzo Settore” research on
the development of the language of social
communication in Italy in the last 30 years, it
offered those who work in the third sector
and communication sector interesting
considerations on the changes taking place
in these contexts. The book “Spot e Post del
terzo settore”, published by Hoepli, was also
presented at the conference. Some of the
sales revenue went to Fabbrica del Sorriso

projects.

The “Una Furtiva Nota” initiative for the
elderly continued in 2019. This project is
based on the idea that art, support,
educational and therapeutic activity play an
essential role in social care situations. The
“Opera Guitta” show, a successful artistic
experiment combining opera, clowning and
theatre in the simplest way possible, is at the
heart of the project, run in collaboration with
Fondazione Don Gnocchi. The show is
written and directed by _ internationally
recognised director Antonio Vergamini and
was performed in six elderly care homes in
