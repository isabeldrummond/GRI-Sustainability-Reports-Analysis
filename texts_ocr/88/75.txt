and preserving a shared historical memory,
to public attention.

Holocaust Memorial Day, 8 March, 25 April, 2
June and 25 November have _ therefore
become components in a calendar of
communication based on historic transitions
and social achievements. Alongside this, a
decision was made to present a position on
environmental issues, the horror’ of
contemporary genocide and war, gender
equality and on the values of social
connection and mutual respect.

Rete4 believes that part of a TV channel’s
responsibility is to express a world view and
build a community, above all by employing
its own voice.

The Mediaset Group in Italy has managed to
attract audiences from every age group -
with a particular focus on the coming
generation - and social class, thanks to its
television programme scheduling and
selection of programmes capable of meeting
all TV viewers’ demands.

The broadcasting strategies that have led to
the success of Mediaset channels in Italy
through the dissemination of products and

content that the users like are the
responsibility of the Programme Schedule
and Distribution General Management in
association with Content General
Management.

These two departments together with the TV
Committee approve the projects.

Once the broadcasting lines on which to
build the entertainment of Mediaset channels
in Italy have been decided, the relevant
Product Area - in this case, the
Entertainment Department - proceeds to the
selection of projects of interest through an
analysis of the market of reference and
monitoring to make sure they are in keeping
with the broadcasting lines in the codified
regulations “Manual of Audiovisual and
Radiophonic Services”.

This manual guides the dissemination of
content following the rules for programming,
protection of minors, business
communication, equal treatment, privacy

and radiophonic regulations.

At the same _ time, both qualitative
(broadcasting characteristics such as type of
programme, positioning on the programme

schedule, listener target and cast of artists)
and quantitative (for example: duration,
hours of product, hourly/total cost, etc.)
television product guidelines and objectives
are defined.

The Entertainment Department guarantees
that the product is always in line with the
values the group wishes to convey and which
are included in its Code of Ethics.

Lastly, constant sharing of the project and
shared selection of programming make sure
that broadcast content meets the quality
expectations of TV users.

To further demonstrate the quality of the
entertainment product, some examples are
programmes like "Striscia la Notizia", "le lene"
and "Forum" which, still with the objective of
entertaining their audience, at the same time
address social and contemporary topics.
