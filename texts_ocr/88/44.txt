e The Net Result from Discontinued
Operations, relating to the net economic
contribution generated by the El Towers
Group (deconsolidated from the fourth
quarter of 2018), including the net capital
gain generated following the sale of this
equity investment.

The value is distributed as shown below:

e Value distributed to external suppliers
inclusive of purchase costs, services,
other costs and amortisation of tangible
and intangible property;

e Remuneration of personnel, which is

equivalent to personnel costs;

e Remuneration of financial institutions,

represented by financial expenses;

e Remuneration of government, including

costs and current taxes;

e Remuneration of the Community,
principally deriving from donations and
grants for social and philanthropic causes
and sponsorship of charities;

 

e Remuneration of minority shareholders
representing the minority interests in the
results of Mediaset Espafa and Monradio.

The difference between the Economic
value generated and the value distributed,
net of non-monetary economic
components, represents, in the absence
of distribution to the shareholders of the
parent Company, the value added
retained by the Company.
