5.5 INDUSTRIAL
RELATIONS

The Mediaset Group has established and built
a consolidated and effective system of
industrial and trade union relations at all
levels of representation.

The topics typically subject to discussion and
disclosure consist of work organisation in
terms of jobs, levels and processes, the
operating performance of the company, the
evolution of the workforce and _ training
issues, as well as the evolution of the
business.

The companies in the Mediaset Group apply
the relevant National Collective Agreements
or Supplementary Company Agreements
(AIA) to all of their employees, regulating all
the typical situations of the employment
relationship. In particular, for — Italian
companies, the following are applied: for
Senior Managers, the National Collective
Bargaining Agreement for Commercial
Senior Managers and for Industrial Senior
Managers; for Middle Managers and White-
Collar Workers, the National Collective
Bargaining Agreement for Private Radio and
Television Companies, for Commercial

Service Industries and for Engineering
Workers; and for Journalists, the FNSI
National Collective Journalists Bargaining
Agreement. In addition, a Supplementary
Company Agreement applied to Middle
Managers and White-Collar Workers and a
Supplementary Company Agreement
applied to Journalist staff that regulate and
improve on the conditions provided for by
the national agreements have been
historically in force for the television area of

the Group.

Specific provisions that further regulate and
detail working conditions, working hours and
ad hoc technical-production models for
individual companies are usually managed
via agreements with the trade union
representatives of the workers concerned.

The Group manages any structural changes
to the organisational, production and
logistics structure that have a _ material
impact on the employment relationship with
employees by following the union discussion
procedures governed by current legislation,
national collective agreements and company
agreements. These activities aim to
guarantee a fruitful negotiation phase that
limits the impact on workers and, where

possible, improves any contractual

provisions.

An agreement was reached in 2018 with the
Italian trade unions to renew the
supplementary company agreement applied
to Middle Managers and  White-Collar
Workers in the broadcasting area of the
Group. In particular, this agreement
introduced new provisions on the
classification of personnel (introducing new
professional figures to match technological
development) and working hours (redefined
for flexibility and greater simplicity) for a
more competitive model of production.
Dedicated Bilateral Committees were also
established for meetings and exchange
concerning the addition of new professional
figures or updating of existing profiles,
welfare and any extraordinary projects that
may affect the scope of the Group. Finally, to
promote generational transition, the Group
undertook to bring in at least 1OO new people
during the effective period of the AIA.

Finally, the agreement signed incorporates
the regulatory provisions established upon
renewal of the National Private Radio and
Television Work Contract (signed with the
Trade Unions in December 2017 and
