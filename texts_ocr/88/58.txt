Risks connected to the management of
human resources

With regard to the risks associated with the
management of human resources, the Group
acknowledges the vital role played by human
resources and the importance of cultivating
transparent relations based on reciprocal
loyalty and trust, and the application of the
rules of conduct dictated by the Code of
Ethics.

Management and cooperation in working
relations is based on respect for the rights of
employees and the full recognition of their
contributions in a perspective of promoting
their professional growth and development.

In particular, in the present competitive
context characterised by profound change
driven by digital transformation processes,
triggered by advances in technology which
are significantly impacting the sectors in
which the Group conducts its business
(creation and distribution of video content,
sale of advertising space), the Group is
increasingly focused on the aspects of
recruiting, training and cultivation of human
resources. Special emphasis is also placed on
identifying talent and the need to create
career development trajectories which
reinforce expertise in areas of key
importance to the Group, particularly
technology and the conception and creation
of broadcasting products, specific training,
the definition and development of career
trajectories and the definition of incentives
plans.

In pursuit of these objectives, the Group
implements systems for evaluating annual
performances based on a clear definition of

shared objectives which can be measured in
numeric, financial and economic terms as
well as individually and qualitatively.

Also, to promote a positive corporate culture
and climate, the Group constantly strives to
improve internal communication flows via
advanced, market-standard collaboration
tools (new corporate intranet project, Office
365 and instant messaging services for all
company employees), as well as introducing
innovative and flexible ways of working
(smart working).

Risks related to the policy on partnerships
and alliances

Historically, the Group has pursued a
strategy of external growth based on a policy
centred on the establishment of highly
targeted partnerships and alliances, with the
objective of ensuring that the business
integration and/or internationalisation
opportunities identified are consistent with
objectives of financial return on the initial
investment. These types of operation expose
the Group to approval risks relating to
authorisations, the implementation of
business models and associated business
plans, as well as the risk of changes in the
