As for the purchase of multi-year
broadcasting rights, it is necessary to
underline the high incidence of expenses
towards the main American majors and
towards the holders of sports broadcasting
rights in the total investments of the Group.
As can be seen from the tables, in 2019, about
95% of Mediaset Group purchases of goods
and services in Italy were from_ Italian
suppliers, while 79% of Mediaset Group
purchases of goods and services in Spain
were from Spanish suppliers.

FAIRNESS IN SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS

Collaboration, supply and contracts
regarding third-party business relationships
with Mediaset Group companies in general
contain an explicit reference to the Code of
Ethics (see also paragraphs 1.3 and 3.2 and
the Corporate 231 Compliance Programmes)
and state that failure to comply with the rules
set forth therein may constitute a breach of
the contractual obligations assumed, with
the consequent option of cancelling any
contracts made with any company in the
group.

35 Art.19 of the Group Code of Ethics.

Furthermore, Mediaset S.p.A. have joined the
initiative promoted by  Assolombarda
(extended to the main Italian companies of
the Group), which started on 27 May 2014,
signing up to the Italian Responsible
Payment Code, the first-ever code in Italy for
responsible payments. In taking this step,
Mediaset has committed to meeting the
payment times agreed on with its suppliers
and in general to promoting a culture of
prompt, transparent payments.

Mediaset is part of the first group of Italian
and multinational companies founding the
Code and, in compliance with its provisions,
it has declared that average payment times
contractually defined with its suppliers for
2019 were 60-90 days and relative payment
dates were duly complied with.

Note that the selection®® of suppliers and the
goods or services to be acquired is based on
the evaluation of various parameters, such as
the quality and price of the good or service,
guarantees of after-sales services, as well as
promptness and efficiency. When selecting
suppliers, great attention goes into verifying
their reliability and seriousness in terms of

compliance with current legislation and
regulations governing their activity.
Purchasing processes are governed by
specific company procedures (OGs), which
ensure the timely identification of suppliers
and the traceability of supply channels, which
thus helps guarantee the quality and
legitimacy of the goods and_ services

purchased.

Furthermore, all purchasing processes are
based on the search for the maximum
competitive advantage for the Mediaset
Group as well as impartiality and the granting
of equal opportunities towards each supplier
who meets requirements.

The preparation of standard contractual
texts or those with specific legal issues is
assured by the Group's legal department,

and by external lawyers where necessary.

In a bid to make the procurement process
more efficient and standardised towards
third parties, the Mediaset Group in Italy
operates via specialised purchasing centres,
whose processes are described in the
following paragraphs.
