5.6 HEALTH AND SAFETY
OF WORKERS

The Mediaset Group in Italy and Spain2® has
adopted, implemented and_ effectively
deployed an Occupational Health and Safety
Management System (OHSMS), compliant
with the OHSAS 18001:2007 standard. After
UNI ISO 45001:2018 comes into force, a new
corporate OHSMS compliant with the new
standard will be implemented in 2020. 11
Group companies have signed up to this
Management System, including22: Mediaset
S.p.A., R.T.l. S.p.A. Medusa Film S.p.A.,
Publitalia'80  S.p.A,  Digitalia‘O8 = Suri,
Radiomediaset S.p.A, Radio Studio 105 S.p.A.,
Virgin Radio Italy S.p.A., Monradio S.r.l., RMC
Italia S.p.A.

In 2019, in addition to Mediaset S.p.A., R.T.l.
S.p.A, Elettronica Industriale S.p.A., Medusa
Film S.p.A., Publitalia’8O S.p.A., Digitalia’08
S.r.l. and Taodue S.r.l., the companies of the
Mediaset Group Radio Hub (except Radio
Subasio and Radio Aut) also obtained

18001:2007 certification from the DNV-GL
certification body.

The application of the OHSMS concerns all
workers operating in all offices of the above
companies and their activity as well as
management of contracted work.

With reference to the new acquisitions, the
Radio Subasio and Radio Aut companies
have not adopted the Mediaset OHSMS in
view of their limited dimensions and logistic
independence of other Group companies.
Assessment of bringing these companies
under the OHSMS of Mediaset as well is
underway.

28 The occupational health and safety management system for the Mediaset Group in Spain does not cover employees in foreign offices. The foreign companies MedSet and Publieurope do not come under the Mediaset OHSMS

either, but refer to local legislation.

29 The Taodue company adopts a version similar to the Mediaset OHSMS and employs an external OH&S service.
