The Workers’ Health & Safety
Representatives (WSR) represent all
workers.

In the case of critical events that may involve
employees during business trips abroad, the
"Personnel Abroad Security Committee” has
been established, consisting of:

e Central Personnel and Organisation

Director
e Safety Director
e Personnel Director

e Company representative of the area to

which the employee concerned belongs.

In order to guarantee safe working
conditions, in May 2013 the Mediaset Group
set up an "Operational Guideline” in order to
guarantee the safety of its personnel on
business trips in countries or areas
considered "at risk".

Lastly, the Risk Management Department
provides adequate insurance coverage for
business trips abroad. It should be noted that
no Mediaset Group employees are involved
in activities with a high accident or health

risk>),

There are also specific clauses that cover
health and safety issues in contracts*? in
which the parties agree that the protection of
health and the physical integrity of workers is
a primary and constant concern for
companies; also, with regard to the
occupational safety and health of workers,
express reference is made to the provisions
of Legislative Decree 81/2008, as amended

and supplemented.**

For 2019, confirming the Group's attention to
the occupational health and safety of its
employees, there were no serious injuries
(duration of more than 6 months) nor cases
of occupational illness or cases of injuries for
external collaborators. There were three

accidents with a number of days’ absence
greater than 70 (95, 112 and 172) according to
INAIL, and they occurred outside of the
company workplace and were not caused by
work (road accidents, etc.).

Occupational health and safety in Spain are
regulated and guaranteed through the
occupational risk prevention plan and the
provisions of the individual national
collective agreements. The plan is jointly
defined by the Group Health and Safety
Committee and by the Prevention Service
(Servicio de Prevencién Mancomunado" or
SPM), which is then approved by Human
Resources and Service Management and
finally presented to the Risk Officer.

The occupational risk prevention § plan
ensures compliance of the company with the
legislative provisions on the prevention of
occupational risks and the requirements of
OHSAS 18001:2007 for the prevention of
standard occupational risks.

31 On 30 November 2018 (published on 5/12/2018) two Organisational Guidelines - 0.G. MD/HO 105 and 106 -were issued, defining the organisational and operating models adopted by the Mediaset Group to manage any crisis
situations (CRISIS Management Compliance Programme), in order to reduce negative impact on the business, limit damage to property and harm to persons and take advantage of any opportunities for the Group, contributing
to improving company resilience and its value in time, also for the purposes of preventing the offences envisaged by Legislative Decree 231/2001 as amended.

The O.G. states that the "Group's priority goal” is to safeguard life and health for all in the company (covering employees, external staff, suppliers, guests...), protecting the company’s reputation, supporting business continuity
in areas and processes considered critical for the business in various safety and security risk scenarios.

32 Mention is made of Art. 20 - Protection of the health and physical integrity of the workers of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement of Employees of Private Radio and Television Companies,

33 Art. 7 - Environment and Health of the Supplementary Agreement for Mediaset Group Companies.
