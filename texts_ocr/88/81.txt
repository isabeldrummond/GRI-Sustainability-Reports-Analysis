created were granted to the European
Commission for its own communication
platforms. The same year saw the production
of the project resulting from the European
Parliament’s 2018 Call for Proposals. It
developed three formats, one in
collaboration with Mediaset Espana,
broadcast during the year:

-Cavoletti da Bruxelles - 30 episodes -
TGCOM24

-Insieme Juntos - 8 episodes - TGCOM24 /
Canal4 (Spain)

-Dov’é l’Europa? - 4 episodes - FOCUS

With a view to optimising the Group’s news
products in terms of both creation and use, it
has progressively implemented an agency
and commentary digitisation project by
introducing technology based on the DALET
GALAXY platform. This allows sharing,
management and broadcasting of all content
produced by the agency in the format of files,
eliminating tape cassettes. The digital
newsroom thus allows for a better, faster and
cheaper way to use all the materials that are
made directly or found online.

In 2019, the Dalet system came to be fully up
and running on the News in the Cologno

Monzese and Rome Palatino production
centres and in the 9 regional agencies. The
newsrooms of the 2 production centres are
synchronised, allowing all users to access the
same content, regardless of location.

The project to digitise productions by
Videonews, including Mattino5, Pomeriggio5,
DomenicaLive and Fuori dal Coro, began in
the final quarter of 2018. The first release in
this project occurred in May 2019.

To allow its services to be used, the Mediaset
Group monitors and makes an effort to
ensure that every single one of its viewers is
placed in the optimal condition to be able to
receive the news and stay informed of what
is going on in the world. Specifically, TG5, in
its main edition at 8 PM provides a subtitling
service for the hearing impaired in order to
make accessing the content easier.

Radio

The Mediaset Group has again expanded its
commercial radio wing through the
acquisition of Radio Montecarlo in 2018,

which joins R101, Radio 105, Virgin Radio Italy
and Radio Subasio.

Each of these radio stations is characterised
by its own line expressed through radio
programs/formats (for example radio of
young target programmes -Radiol05-; "flow"
(like format) radio -R101-, "vertical" radio -
Virgin Radio; “elite” radio with high-profile
target-RMC; “family” radio with distinctive
elements from _ Italian — tradition-Radio

Subasio).

In relation to this line, maximum
independence and plurality of expression is
guaranteed following the industry
regulations (Radio Television Consolidated
Act) and the current company guidelines
that require daily monitoring of the activity
carried out by the artistic resources (radio
speakers and guests), the topics addressed
in the relative sources as well as the

advertising content aired.

The Mediaset Group undertakes to maximise
enjoyment of the radio product with a
widespread dissemination both in
geographical and target audience terms, also
through systematic maintenance and

enhancement activity on the radio broadcast
