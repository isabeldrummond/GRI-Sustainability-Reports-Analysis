disclosure - of the climate change impact
generated and undergone by the Group. This
also relates to the development of regulation
in this area, in particular the guidelines from
the European Commission (Communication
2019/C 209/01 “Guidelines on non-financial

related information”).

For further information on the initiatives of
the Group, the main risks generated or
undergone and the management methods
for these, please refer to the paragraph “The
internal control and risk management
system” and the corresponding sections in
this document.

In particular regard to respect for human
rights, and given the regulatory environment
in which Mediaset operates, this topic is
addressed as part of the management of
relations with employees and suppliers, in
observance of the principles and values
embodied in the Code of Ethics of the Group,
updated in 2019. In view of the specific
nature of the business sector in which the
Group operates, note that the Group does
not consume significant amounts of water or

emit atmospheric pollutants other than
greenhouse gases. For this reason, and
without detracting from the full
comprehension of the Group's activities,
information on these topics (addressed in
article 3 paragraph 2 of Decree 254) is not
included in the present Report.

The contents of the present document are
arranged by material issues for the Group
and its stakeholders, as identified by the
materiality analysis. In particular, the process
whereby the contents were defined is based
on the principles of relevance, inclusiveness
of stakeholders, completeness and operating
context for the Group. The principles of
balance, accuracy, verifiability and
comparability have been observed in regard
to the quality of the information reported.

Specifically, in 2019 the results of the
materiality analysis carried out in 2018
(materiality matrix) were shared with senior
managers in the Group during the ERM
strategic risk assessment interviews.
Following these interviews, the Group
confirmed that the issues in the materiality
matrix are monitored systematically within

the corporate risk assessment process.

The GRI Content Index containing the GRI
indicators associated with each material
topic can be found in the appendix to this
document.

The scope of the economic and financial data

Mediaset Group. The scope of social and
environmental data and information includes
the companies which were members of the
Mediaset Group on 31 December 2019 and
