termination of the campaign, as well as fines
and civil/penal sanctions against (also) the
broadcaster.

Refusal to broadcast the advertising
message can only occur in cases where
obvious critical issues in the communication
of a legal nature cannot be avoided.

Another assessment criterion that would
affect an advertising campaign being
broadcast on Mediaset networks is the
conformity of the message to the publishing
policy of the networks.

With respect to its target audience, the
Mediaset Group applies strict selection on
advertising that relates to or belongs to
certain product sectors which - even if lawful
and legitimately publishable - could be
considered as not compliant with the
publishing policy (e.g. the Group does not
advertise weapons, funeral services, legal
cannabis, dating sites for sexual purposes) or
in relation to the content of the message
itself (e.g. vulgarity, violence, etc.).

This editorial judgement varies depending on
the characteristics of the medium and

therefore also of the target audience for
which the advertising is intended.

Note that, on 8 January 2018, Agcom closed
proceedings, with a warning’ against
proceeding with the practice challenged,
concerning advertising overcrowding
brought against Italial, Canale 5 and Rete 4
in September 2017 with reference to
exceeding the crowding limit for Group radio

(Radio 101) self-promotion messages.

These resolutions were promptly appealed
and an application for interim relief was filed
by R.T.I. with the competent administrative
judge.

R.T.I. promptly took it upon itself to bring its
conduct in line with the new stance of Agcom
outlined in the above-mentioned resolutions.
Specifically, R.T.l. began to bring its conduct
into line on 7 February 2018 (in the absence
of a deadline set by the resolutions
themselves), thus complying with the time
limits for processing the application for
interim relief. Nevertheless, in April 2018
Agcom challenged Italial, Canale5 and Rete4
with regard to their advertising
overcrowding during the months of January
and February 2018 (despite the Council

Chamber having met after those dates) for
the tally of the Group’s radio self-advertising
spots (Radio 105).

In November 2018, Agcom brought the
proceedings to an end, imposing penalties of
EUR 20,658 to Canale5, EUR 20,658 to Italial
and EUR 20,658 to Rete4. The penalties were
appealed with the Regional Administrative
Court (TAR) in January 2019.

On 16 April 2019, the Lazio Regional
Administrative Court rejected the three
appeals against the Agcom challenges and
on 16 July 2019 the sentences were appealed
with the Council of State.

The Mediaset Group is committed to
broadcasting messages that have more than
just a commercial purpose. To that effect,
Mediaset is a founding member of the
Pubblicita
represented by Publitalia 80 along with the

Fondazione Progresso,
major players in communication in Italy. This
foundation aims to contribute to solving the
civil, educational and moral problems of the
community by placing communication at the
service of society.
