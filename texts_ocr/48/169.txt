For a financial asset reclassified from the available-for
sale category, the fair value carrying amount at the date
of reclassification becomes its new amortised cost and
any previous gain or loss on the asset that has been rec-
ognised in equity is amortised to profit or loss over the
remaining life of the investment using the EIR. Any differ-
ence between the new amortised cost and the maturity
amount is also amortised over the remaining life of the
asset using the EIR. If the asset is subsequently deter-
mined to be impaired, then the amount recorded in equity
is reclassified to the income statement.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or
loss

This category comprises financial assets held for trading,
i.e. acquired mainly to be sold in a short term, and finan-
cial assets that upon initial recognition are designated as
at fair value through profit or loss.

In particular both bonds and equities, mainly quoted, and
all derivative assets, held for both trading and hedging
purposes, are included in this category. Financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss also take into account
investments back to policies where the investment risk
is borne by the policyholders and back to pension funds
in order to significantly reduce the valuation mismatch
between assets and related liabilities.

Structured instruments, whose embedded derivatives
cannot be separated from the host contracts, are classi-
fied as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

The financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are
accounted for at settlement date and are measured at
fair value. Their unrealized and realized gains and losses
at the end of the period are immediately accounted for in
the profit and loss account.

The Group evaluates its financial assets held for trading,
other than derivatives, to determine whether the intention
to sell them in the near term is still appropriate. When, in
rare circumstances, the Group is unable to trade these
financial assets due to inactive markets and manage-
ment’s intention to sell them in the foreseeable future
significantly changes, the Group may elect to reclassi-
fy them. The reclassification to loans and receivables,
Available for sale or held to maturity depends on the
nature of the asset. This evaluation does not affect any

Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a finan-
cial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is
de-recognised when:

- the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have
expired;

— the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to
pay the received cash flows in full without material de-
lay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement;
and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all
the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the
risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred con-
trol of the asset.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash
flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has re-
tained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the
risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control
of the asset, the asset is recognised to the extent of the
Group’s continuing involvement in the asset. In that case,
the Group also recognises an associated liability. The
transferred asset and the associated liability are meas-
ured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations
that the Group has retained. Continuing involvement that
takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset
is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount
of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration
that the Group could be required to repay.
