The Group can be also exposed to liquidity outflows re-
lated to issued guarantees, commitments, derivative con-
tract margin calls or regulatory constraints.

The Group liquidity risk management framework re-
lies on projecting cash obligations and available cash
resources over defined time horizons, to monitor that
available liquid resources are at all times sufficient to
cover cash obligations that will become due in the same
horizons.

A set of liquidity risk metrics (liquidity indicators) has
been defined to monitor the liquidity situation of each
Group insurance Legal Entity on a regular basis. All such
metrics are forward-looking, i.e. they are calculated at a
future date based on projections of cash flows, assets
and liabilities and an assessment of the level of liquidity
of the asset portfolio.

The metrics are calculated under both the so-called
“base scenario”, in which the values of cash flows, as-
sets and liabilities correspond to those projected ac-
cording to each Legal Entity’s Strategic Plan scenario,
and a set of so-called “stress scenarios”, in which the
projected cash inflows and outflows, the market price of
assets and the amount of technical provisions are calcu-
lated to take into account unlikely but plausible circum-
stances that would adversely impact the liquidity of each
Legal Entity.

Liquidity risk limits have been defined in terms of value of
the above-mentioned liquidity indicators. The limit frame-
work is designed to ensure that each Group Legal Entity
holds a “buffer” of liquidity in excess of the amount re-
quired to withstand the adverse circumstances described
in the stress scenarios.

Generali has defined a set of metrics to measure liquidity
risk at Group level, based on the liquidity metrics calcu-
lated at Legal Entity level. The Group manages expected
cash inflows and outflows in order to maintain a sufficient
available level of liquid resources to meet its medium-term
needs. The Group metrics are forward-looking and are
calculated under both the base and stress scenarios.

The Group has established clear governance for liquidity

risk measurement, management, mitigation and report-
ing, including specific limit setting and the escalation pro-

19 ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance.

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

cess in case of limit breaches or other liquidity issues.

The annual assessment shows a solid liquidity profile for
Generali Group, without substantial changes compared
to the previous year.

The principles for liquidity risk management designed at
Group level are fully embedded in strategic and business
processes, including investments and product develop-
ment.

Since Generali Group explicitly identifies liquidity risk as
one of the main risks connected with investments, indi-
cators as cash flow duration mismatch are embedded in
the Strategic Asset Allocation process. Investment limits
are set to ensure that the share of illiquid assets remains
within the level that does not impair the Group’s asset
liquidity.

The Group has defined in its Life and P&C Underwriting
Policies the principles to be applied to mitigate the impact
on liquidity from surrenders in life business and claims in
non-life business.

Reputational and Emerging Risk

Although not included in the calculation of SCR, the fol-

lowing risks are also assessed:

— reputational risk referring to potential losses aris-
ing from deterioration or a negative perception of the
Group among its customers and other stakeholders;

- emerging risks arising from new trends or evolving
risks which are difficult to perceive and quantify, al-
though typically systemic. These typically refer to tech-
nological changes (such as big data), environmental
trends (with a major focus on climate change) and ge-
opolitical developments. For the assessment of these
risks and to raise the awareness on the implications of
the emerging trends, Risk Management Function en-
gages with a dedicated network, including specialists
from business functions (e.g. Insurance, Investment,
Finance, Marketing and Sustainability and Social Re-
sponsibility, given the relevant interrelation with ESG'?
factors). The Group also participates to the Emerging
Risk Initiative (ERI), a dedicated working group of the
CRO Forum. Within ERI emerging risks common to the
insurance industry are discussed and specific studies
are conducted.
