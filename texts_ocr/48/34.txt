Demographic and social change

Modern communities continue to be influenced by
distinct demographic and social phenomena with a
strong impact on their socio-economic balances.

In Europe, we are witnessing a continual process of
population aging, driven by an increase in life expectancy
and a decrease in birth rates. The international migration
phenomena only partially counter-balance this trend,
which is in any case otherwise influenced by socio-
political initiatives adopted locally. Outside of Europe, we
are noticing similar phenomena, though of a lower scope
compared to the European situation and in any case
significant on a broader time horizon.

In the more mature economies, the younger age groups

 

are affected by a reduced and often discontinuous
capacity to generate average income; this is strongly
influenced by a flexible but precarious labour market
that does not ensure reasonable certainty for financing
the public welfare system. The result is increasingly
unbalanced communities where higher post-retirement
pension and healthcare requirements are no longer
properly financed and covered by the public system, in
addition, the limited economic and financial resources
produced by the younger categories of the population, or
from private savings in general, have to be directed and
valued more carefully.

In this context of profound changes, the matter of human
rights grows in importance, especially in the less mature
economies, where labour law is under development.

 

 

 

and our management

We actively engage in creating more stable communities
while monitoring and tackling the effects of a changing
society. This is why we develop and offer flexible and
modular pension and welfare solutions for the coverage
of healthcare costs and other potential current and
future needs for individuals, families and communities.
In particular, we are focusing on the senior customers
segment with modular solutions that combine savings,
protection and services in a welfare perspective. We also
undertake to strengthen dialogue with individuals during
their entire period of interaction with our companies
through services accessible 24/7,

We provide customers with complete and easily
accessible information on products and services while
helping them to understand the primary factors that
may affect their income capacity and aiding them in
accurately assessing their capacity to save as well as
identifying their current and future needs. We believe
that insurance coverage is the most appropriate tool to
forecast and meet potential needs of both younger and
older individuals with the required advance notice; we
therefore formulate and present offers even in the case of
market contexts with little knowledge and low individual
propensity for insurance solutions.

A

Life products, including pension and welfare products,
imply Generali’s acceptance of biometric underwriting
risks, typically mortality, longevity and health. We
therefore need to manage them through the underwriting
processes that currently exist, which are based on
an updated assessment of the socio-demographic
conditions of the population whose purpose is to
understand their relative trends. We also have pricing
and product approval processes that offer a preliminary
analysis of the cases regarding the biometric factors and
a structured governance defined in the Life underwriting
policy, which is applied at Group level. Lastly, we measure
the mortality, longevity and health risks using the Group’s
internal risk model.

We also commit ourselves to and monitor the respect
of human rights thanks to the Group's guidelines and
policies, including the Code of Conduct, the Responsible
Investment Guideline and the Responsible Underwriting
Guideline.
