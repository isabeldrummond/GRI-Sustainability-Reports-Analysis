Risk Governance

Risk governance is a part of the broader Group system
of governance.

The Group system of governance, which includes the
internal control and risk management system, consists
of the roles and responsibilities of the Administrative,
Management or Supervisory Body (AMSB), of the Senior
Management and of the Key Functions. It also consists
of the policies, administrative and accounting procedures
and organizational structures aimed at identifying, eval-
uating, measuring, managing and monitoring the main
risks.

Key elements of the internal control and risk management
system are:

— internal control environment;

— internal control activities;

— awareness;

- monitoring and reporting.

To ensure a consistent framework through the Group, the
Parent Company sets Group Directives on the System of
Governance, complemented by Group Internal Control
and Risk Management Policies, which have to be applied
by all Group Legal Entities.

The Group system of governance is founded on the es-

tablishment of an AMSB and of three lines of defence:

— the Operating Functions (“risk owners”), which repre-
sent the first line of defence and have ultimate respon-
sibility for risks relating to their area of responsibility;

- Actuarial, Compliance and Risk Management Func-
tions, which represent the second line of defence;

- Internal Audit, which represents the third line of de-
fence.

Internal Audit together with Actuarial, Compliance
and Risk Management Functions represent the “Key
Functions”.

The roles and responsibilities of the AMSB and related

committees, Senior Management, Key Functions and the

interactions among Key Functions are described within

the Corporate Governance Report. Key roles within the

risk management system are outlined below:

- the AMSB is the ultimate responsible for the System
of Governance and must ensure that the Group Legal

Entity’s system of governance and internal control and
risk management system are consistent with all the ap-
plicable regulations. To this end, the AMSB, supported
by the Key Functions, reassesses the System of Gov-
ernance adequacy periodically and at least once a year.
The AMSB approves the Group Legal Entity’s organ-
izational set-up, establishes the Key Functions defin-
ing their mandate and reporting lines as well as, where
appropriate, any support committee, adopts Group In-
ternal Control and Risk Management Policies, performs
the duties related to the ORSA, risk concentration and
intragroup transactions, approves the ORSA results
and based on them defines the risk appetite;

- the Senior Management is responsible for the imple-
mentation, maintenance and monitoring of the system
of internal controls and risk management, including
risks arising from non-compliance with regulations, in
accordance with the directives of the AMSB;

— Key Functions are established at Group level and within
the operating entities:

e the Risk Management Function supports the AMSB
and Senior Management in ensuring the effective-
ness of the risk management system and provides
advice and support to the main business deci-
sion-making processes;

e the Compliance Function grants that the organiza-
tional and the internal procedures are adequate to
manage the risk to incur in administrative or judiciary
fines, economic losses or reputational damages as
a consequence of non-compliance with laws, regu-
lations, provisions, and the risk deriving from unfa-
vourable changes in the law or judicial orientation
(compliance risk);

© the Actuarial Function coordinates the technical pro-
visions calculation and grants the adequacy of un-
derlying methodologies, models and assumptions,
verifies the quality of the related data and expresses
an opinion on the overall Underwriting Policy and on
the adequacy of reinsurance arrangements;

© the Audit Function verifies business processes and
the adequacy and effectiveness of controls in place
also proving support and advice.

Heads of Key Functions report to the AMSB.

Group Key Functions collaborate according to a pre-de-
fined coordination model, in order to share information
and create synergies. A strong Parent Company coordi-
nation and direction for Key Functions is granted by the
so called solid reporting lines model established between
the head of the Group Key Function and heads of the
respective Functions within the operating entities.
