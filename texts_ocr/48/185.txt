However, due to the complexity and uncertainty affecting
the above mentioned items, future events and actions,
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates,
possibly significantly.

Further information on the process used to determine
assumptions affecting the above mentioned items and
the main risk factors are included in the paragraphs on
accounting principles and in the risk report.

Share based payments

The stock option plans granted by the Board in past pe-
riods configure as share based payments to compensate
officers and employees. The fair value of the share options
granted is estimated at the grant date and is based on
the option pricing model that takes into account, at the
grant date, factors such as the exercise price and the life
of the options, the current price of the underlying shares,
the expected volatility of the share price, the dividends ex-
pected on the shares and the risk-free interest rate as well
as the specific characteristics of the plan itself. The pricing
model is based on a binomial simulation that takes into
account the possibility of early exercise of the options. If
present, the pricing model estimates separately the option
value and the probability that the market conditions are
satisfied. Therefore, the abovementioned values deter-
mine the fair value of equity instruments granted.

Long term incentive plans, aimed at strengthening the
bond between the remuneration of management and ex-
pected performance in accordance with the Group stra-
tegic plan, as well as the link between remuneration and
generation of value in comparison with peers, are also
treated as an equity-settled share-based payment.

The fair value of the right to obtain free shares in rela-
tion to market condition is assessed at grant date and is
based on a model that takes into account factors such as
historical volatility of the Generali share price and of the
peer group, the correlation between these shares, the div-
idends expected on the shares, the risk-free interest rate
as well as the specific characteristics of the plan itself. The
pricing model is based on simulation models generally
used for this type of estimation. Other conditions different

than market condition are considered external to this val-
uation. The probability that these conditions are satisfied,
combined with the estimated fair value of the right to ob-
tain free shares, defines the overall plan cost.

The cost is charged to the profit and loss account and, as
a double-entry, to equity during the vesting period, taking
into account, where possible, the probability of satisfac-
tion of the vesting condition related to the rights granted.

The charge or credit to the profit or loss for a period repre-
sents the change in cumulative expense recognised as at
the beginning and end of that period.

No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimate-
ly vest, except for equity-settled transactions for which
vesting is conditional upon a market or a non-vesting con-
dition. These are treated as vested irrespective of wheth-
er or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied,
provided that all other performance and/or service condi-
tions are satisfied.

When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified,
the minimum expense to be recognised is the expense
had the terms had not been modified, only if the original
terms of the award are met.

An additional expense is recognized for any modification
that increases the total fair value of the share-based pay-
ment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employ-
ee as measured at the date of modification.

When an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as
if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense
not yet recognised for the award is recognized immedi-
ately. This includes any award where non-vesting condi-
tions within the control of either the entity or the employee
are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for
the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement
award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new
awards are treated as if they were a modification of the
original award, as described in the previous paragraph.

The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted
earnings per share.
