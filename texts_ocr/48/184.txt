Further the Group set cash flow hedges on forecast re-
financing operations of subordinated liabilities that are
accounted for as hedge of a forecast operations, that are
highly probable and could affect profit or loss. The por-
tion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that
is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized di-
rectly in an appropriate item of comprehensive income.
The ineffective portion of the gains or loss on the hedg-
ing instrument is recognized in profit or loss. If a forecast
transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a
financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains
or losses that were recognised in other comprehensive
income shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss
as a reclassification adjustment.

Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are ac-
counted for similarly to cash flow hedges: the effective
portion of gain or loss on the hedging instrument is rec-
ognized among the components of profit or loss, while
the part is not effective be recognized in the separate
income statement.

Impairment losses on financial
assets

As for financial assets, except investments at fair value
through profit or loss, IAS 39 is applied whether there is
any objective evidence that they are impaired.

Evidence of impairment includes, for example, significant
financial difficulties of the issuer, its default or delinquen-
cy in interest or principal payments, the probability that
the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reor-
ganisation and the disappearance of an active market for
that financial asset.

The recognition of impairment follows a complex anal-
ysis in order to conclude whether there are conditions
to effectively recognize the loss. The level of detail and
the detail with which testing is being undertaken varies
depending on the relevance of the latent losses of each
investment.

A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an
investment in an equity instrument below its average cost
is considered as an objective evidence of impairment.

The threshold of significance is defined at 30%, while the
prolonged decline in fair value is defined as a continu-

ous decline in market value below average cost for 12
months.

The prolonged decline in value of bonds and loans are
evaluated as a result of specific analysis that involve the
single issuances.

If an investment has been impaired in previous periods,
further fair value declines are automatically considered
prolonged.

If there is objective evidence of impairment the loss is

measured as follows:

— on financial assets at amortised cost, as the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present
value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the
financial asset’s original effective interest rate;

— on available for sale financial assets, as the difference
between the cost and the fair value at the measure-
ment date.

Reversals of impairment are recognized respectively: in
the profit or loss in the case of debt instruments, in the
equity reserve in the case of equity securities including
shares of mutual funds (IFU).

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements compliant to IFRS
requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions
that affect items reported in the consolidations financial
balance sheet and income statement and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates
mainly refers to as follows:

— insurance provisions for the life and non-life segment;

— financial instruments measured at fair value classified
in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy;

- the analysis in order to identify durable impairments on
intangible assets (e.g. goodwill) booked in in the bal-
ance sheet (impairment test);

- deferred acquisition costs and value of business ac-
quired;

— other provisions

- deferred and anticipated taxes;

- defined benefit plan obligation;

— share-base payments.

- Estimates are periodically reviewed and are based on
key management’s best knowledge of current facts
and circumstances.
