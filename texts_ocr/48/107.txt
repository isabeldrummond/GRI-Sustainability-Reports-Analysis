Product pricing consists in setting product features and
assumptions regarding biometric, policyholders’ behav-
iour, financial and expenses assumptions to allow the
Group Legal Entities to withstand any adverse develop-
ment in the realization of these assumptions.

For savings business, this is mainly achieved through
profit testing, while for protection business with a biom-
etric component, it is achieved by setting prudent as-
sumptions.

Lapse risk, related to voluntary withdrawal from the con-
tract, and expense risk, related to the uncertainty around
the expenses that the Group expects to incur in the fu-
ture, are evaluated in a prudential manner in the pricing of
new products. This evaluation is taken into account in the
construction and profit testing of a new tariff, consider-
ing the underlying assumptions derived from the Group’s
experience.

For insurance portfolios with a biometric risk component,
comprehensive reviews of the mortality experience are
compared with expected mortality of the portfolio, deter-
mined according to the most up-to-date mortality tables
available in each market. To this end, mortality by sex,
age, policy year, sum assured and other underwriting
criteria are taken into consideration to ensure mortality
assumptions remain adequate and avoid the risk of mis-
estimating for the next underwriting years.

The same annual assessment of the adequacy of the mor-
tality tables used in the pricing is performed for longevity
risk. In this case, not only biometric risks are considered
but also the financial risks related to the minimum interest
rate guarantee and any potential mismatch between the
liabilities and the corresponding assets.

As part of the underwriting process, Generali Group
adopts underwriting guidelines. Risk Management
Function reviews implications of new lines of business/
products on the Group risk profile.

Moreover, a particular emphasis is placed on the under-
writing of new contracts with reference to medical, finan-
cial and moral hazard risks. The Group has defined clear
underwriting standards through manuals, forms, medical
and financial underwriting requirements. For insurance

riders, which are most exposed to moral hazard, maxi-
mum insurability levels are also set, lower than those ap-
plied for death covers. In order to mitigate these risks,
policy exclusions are also defined.

Regular risk exposure monitoring and adherence to the
operative limits, reporting and escalation processes are
also in place, allowing for potential remediation actions
to be undertaken.

Finally, reinsurance represents the main risk mitigating
technique. The Parent Company acts as core reinsurer for
the Group Legal Entities and cedes part of the business
to external reinsurers.

The definition of a reinsurance arrangement is based on
the process managed by Reinsurance Function in con-
stant interaction with Risk Management and Actuarial
Functions.

Non-Life Underwriting Risk

Non-life underwriting risks arise from the Group’s insur-
ance business in the P&C segment.

Non-life underwriting risks include the risk of underesti-
mating the frequency and/or severity of the claims in de-
fining pricing and reserves (respectively pricing risk and
reserving risk), the risk of losses arising from extreme
or exceptional events (catastrophe risk) and the risk of
policyholder lapses from P&C insurance contracts. In
particular:

— pricing and catastrophe risks derive from the possibility
that premiums are not sufficient to cover future claims,
also in connection with extremely volatile events and
contract expenses;

- reserving risk relates to the uncertainty of the claims
reserves (in a one-year time horizon);

— lapse risk arises from the uncertainty of the underwrit-
ing profits recognised in the premium provisions.
