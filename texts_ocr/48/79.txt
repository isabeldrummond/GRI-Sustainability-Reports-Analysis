(*) Net of depreciations.

The net current return on investments in the Life seg-
ment posted a modest decline, falling from 3.2% at
31 December 2017 to 3.1% with the relative income
decreasing to € 9,489 million (€ 9,678 million at 31
December 2017).

The contribution to the result of the period from the har-
vesting transactions stood at -0.1% (0.6 at 31 December
2017), due to a greater impact of the impairment losses
and a more prudent harvesting policy.

insurance provisions

 

The technical provisions and financial liabilities of the Life
segment - excluding deferred liabilities to policyholders -
amounted to € 343,400 million; the increase on an equiv-
alent consolidation area stood at 2.2% and reflected the
increase in the reserves relating to the traditional busi-
ness (+3.4% on an equivalent consolidation area). The
reserves relating to the linked portfolio, instead, fall by
2.6% on an equivalent consolidation area: the positive

effect of the net cash inflows was absorbed by the neg-
ative performance of financial markets, reflected in the
evolution of these reserves.

The deferred liabilities to policyholders stood at € 10,584
million (€ 21,231 million at 31 December 2017), reflecting
the change in the investments value, particularly in gov-
ernment bonds.
