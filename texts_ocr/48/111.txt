impact of these changes on any interest rate sensitive
asset and also on the value of future liability cash-flows
alike;

— interest rate volatility risk models the impact that the
variability in interest rate curves can have on both the
market value of derivatives and the value of liabilities
sensitive to interest rate volatility assumptions (such as
minimum pension guarantees);

— property risk models the returns on a selection of pub-
lished property investment indices and the associated
impact on the value of the Group’s property assets.
These are mapped to various indices based on proper-
ty location and type of use;

— for currency risk, the plausible movements in exchange
rate of the reporting currency of the Group in respect
to foreign currencies are modelled, as well as the con-
sequent impact on the value of asset holdings not de-
nominated in the domestic currency;

— for concentration risk the extent of additional risk borne
by the Group due to insufficient diversification in its eq-
uity, property and bond portfolios is assessed.

The SCR for financial risk amounts to € 13,437 million
before diversification (equal to 42% of total SCR before
diversification). This is mainly driven by equity risk, fol-
lowed by interest rate, property and currency risk.

Credit Risk

The Group is exposed to credit risks related to invested
assets and those arising from other counterparties (e.g.
cash, reinsurance).

Credit risks include the following two categories:

- spread widening risk, defined as the risk of adverse
changes in the market value of debt security assets.
Spread widening can be linked either to the market’s
assessment of the creditworthiness of the specific obli-
gor (often implying also a decrease in rating) or to a
market-wide systemic reduction in the price of credit
assets;

— default risk, defined as the risk of incurring in losses
because of the inability of a counterparty to honour its
financial obligations.

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

Credit risks are measured by means of the Group PIM"®.

In particular:

- credit spread risk models the possible movement of
the credit spread levels for bond exposures of differ-
ent rating, industrial sector and geography based on
the historical analysis of a set of representative bond
indices. Spread-sensitive assets held by the Group are
associated with specific indices based on the charac-
teristics of their issuer and currency;

— default risk models the impact of default of bond is-
suers or counterparties to derivatives, reinsurance and
other transactions on the value of the Group’s assets.
Distinct modelling approaches have been implemented
to model default risk for the bond portfolio (i.e. cred-
it default risk) and the risk arising from the default of
counterparties in cash deposits, risk mitigation con-
tracts (such as reinsurance), and other types of expo-
sures (i.e. counterparty default risk).

The Group PIM’s credit risk model evaluates spread risk
and default risk also for sovereign bond exposures. This
approach is more prudent than the standard formula,
which treats bonds issued by EU Central Governments
and denominated in domestic currency as exempt from
credit risk.

The SCR for credit risk amounts to € 8,342 million before
diversification (equal to 26% of total SCR before diversifi-
cation). Credit risk is mostly driven by spread risk on fixed
income securities, while the contribution to SCR of the
counterparty risk (including reinsurance default) remains
more limited.

The credit risk assessment is based on the credit rating
assigned to counterparties and financial instruments. To
limit the reliance on external rating assessments provided
by rating agencies, an internal credit rating assignment
framework has been set within the Risk Management
Group Policy.

Within this framework additional rating assessments can
be performed at counterparty and/or financial instrument
level and ratings need to be renewed at least annually.
This process applies even where an external rating is
available. Moreover, additional assessments shall be per-
formed each time the parties involved in the process pos-
sess any information, coming from reliable sources, that
may affect the creditworthiness of the issuer/issues.
