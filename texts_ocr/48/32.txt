are changing in light of two global trends: digitalization,
which has introduced new selling options and more
diverse insurance product management, and economic
uncertainty, which has changed spending on savings

and other insurance products.

Customers currently place greater focus on service
quality: they have a more independent approach to the
decision-making process, which includes visiting the
websites of insurance companies, reading customer
reviews on social media and checking comparison

websites. However, the role of the agent is stil
the purchase of an insurance product.

their products and the past interactions;

Generali to manage new solution launches;

Agent Hub is an initiative focused on supporting the digitalisation of our distribution network, strengthening the
advisory activity addressed to the customer and digital interaction with the customers.

Mobile & Web Hub is an initiative focused on supporting relationships with our customers, on making management
of the key insurance operations easier (e.g. claims management) and on making good use of the many platforms. It
offers customers a simple and quick consultation of their policies using different devices, it emphasises the centrality
of the relationship with the network of agents and exploits the connectivity and geolocation potentials in order to offer
personalised services.

Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Austria, Argentina, Turkey, Portugal and India have joined the initiative.
The first markets have launched the My Generali application in the stores and soon also the versions of the remaining
countries will be developed and published. The platform, which is continuously evolving with the collaboration
provided by the member countries, will also be extended to other business units.
