40 Transfers of financial instruments
measured at fair value between
Level 1 and Level 2

Generally transfers between levels are attributable to
changes in market activities and observability of the in-
puts used in valuation techniques to determine the fair
value of certain instruments.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are mainly trans-
ferred from level 1 to level 2 when the liquidity and the
frequency of transactions are no longer indicative of an

active market. Conversely, for transfers from level 2 to
level 1.

The transfers were as follows:

— from level 2 to level 1 € 6,466 million and from level 1 to
level 2 € 154 million of bonds, mainly corporate, mainly
due to the different availability of information on their
value and price

— from level 2 to level 1 € 508 million and from level 1
to level 2 € 239 million of investments back to poli-
cies where the risk is borne by the policyholders for the
same reasons of the latter point.
