2.1 Activities performed by the Board of
Statutory Auditors

The Board of Statutory Auditors monitored compliance
by the Company with the legislation and the Articles of
Association and observance of the principles of correct
administration, with special reference to transactions
having a significant impact on the economic, financial
and asset-based position, by regularly attending meet-
ings of the Board of Directors and examining the docu-
mentation provided.

In this context, the Board of Statutory Auditors received
information from the Managing Director and the Board
of Directors about the activities performed and transac-
tions with a significant impact on the economic, financial
and asset-based position conducted by the Company,
including through directly or indirectly controlled compa-
nies.

On the basis of the information provided, the Board of
Statutory Auditors reasonably concludes that the said
transactions can be deemed to comply with the legisla-
tion, the Articles of Association and principles of sound
management, and that they do not appear to be mani-
festly imprudent, precarious or in conflict with the resolu-
tions passed by the Shareholders’ Meeting, or such as to
prejudice the integrity of the Company’s assets.

In particular, the Board of Statutory Auditors was in-
formed about transactions in which Directors declared
an interest either on their own account or on behalf of
third parties, and has no comments to make about the
compliance of the corresponding resolutions with the
legislation and regulations.
