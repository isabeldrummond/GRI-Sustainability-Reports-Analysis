Share-based compensation plans granted by
Banca Generali

At 31 December 2018, Banca Generali’s following pay-
ment agreements based on own equity instruments were
in place:

— the plans launched with respect to the Banca Generali
Group’s Remuneration and Incentivisation Policy, in ef-
fect from time to time, which calls for a part of the var-
iable remuneration of Key Personnel to be paid using
Banca Generali’s own financial instruments;

— the plans launched in service of the Framework Loy-
alty Programme 2017-2026, approved by the General
Shareholders’ Meeting on 20 April 2017 and now in
its second annual cycle (2018-2026), which calls for a
maximum of 50% of the indemnity accrued to be paid
using own financial instruments;

- the new Long-Term Incentive plan based on Banca
Generali shares, approved by the General Sharehold-
ers’ Meeting on 12 April 2018, reserved for the Banking
Group’s top management.

Share-based payment plans linked to the
variable portion of remuneration based on
performance objectives

The Remuneration and Incentivisation Policy for the Key
Personnel of the Banca Generali Group — adopted in
compliance with the Supervisory Provisions currently
in force — requires a portion of the variable component
of remuneration, both current and deferred, to be paid
by allotting Banca Generali’s own financial instruments,

based on the rules annually submitted for approval to the
Bank’s General Shareholders’ Meeting.

The overall number of shares to be allotted is defined by
dividing the 25% portion of variable remuneration pay-
able in the form of shares by the average price of the
Banca Generali stock during the three months prior to
the meeting of the Board of Directors that approves the
Separate and Consolidated Financial Statements for the
year prior to that in which the cycle in question begins.
However, the number of shares actually allotted to bene-
ficiaries may change based on the assessment of satis-
faction of the individual objectives set for the year.

The fair value of Banca Generali stock at the allotment
date is equal to the market price reported at the date of
the Shareholders’ Meeting that approved the Remunera-
tion Policy for the current year.

These plan categories also include any other compensa-

tion paid in the form of shares related to:

- ordinary sales incentives and new-recruit plan for Fi-
nancial Advisors other than the main network manag-
ers and employed sales personnel;

— agreements entered into in view or upon the early ter-
mination of the work or agency relationship, with re-
gard to the beneficiaries falling within the category of
Key Personnel.

At 31 December 2018, there were three active cycles of
share-based plans in connection to the Remuneration
Policies relating to 2016, 2017 and 2018.

The main features of the share-based plan, linked to

2016 Remuneration Polices and approved by the General

Shareholders’ Meeting on 21 April 2016, are as follows:

— for the purpose of determining the number of shares
to be allotted, the price of reference of Banca Generali
shares, calculated as the average official market price
during the period 12 December 2015 to 9 March 2016,
was determined to be 25.26 euros;

— the fair value of Banca Generali shares at the allotment
date was equal to the market price (approximately 26
euros) reported on 21 April 2016, subsequently adjust-
ed to account for the loss of dividends expected in the
deferral period.

In that cycle, the shares to be allotted to Key Personnel
totalled 72,973, of which 59,377 were allotted to Network
Managers, 11,695 to employees, and 1,721 referred to
