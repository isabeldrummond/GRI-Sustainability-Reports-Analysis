(€ million) Carrying amount* (IAS 39)
AAA 24,111
AA 74,599
A 67,643
BBB 118,140
Non investment grade 6,181
Not Rated 4,228
Total 294,903

In addition to the bonds presented in the table above,
financial assets that envisage cash flows represented
solely by principal and interest payments also include
mortgages and other loans, term deposits, repurchase
agreements (reverse REPO) and receivables from banks
and bank customers.

The loan portfolio consists mainly of mortgages with
low credit risk (analogous to investment grade); largely
guaranteed by collateral, mainly real estate, and primarily
managed by Group banks. Furthermore, the credit risk
management process includes a careful assessment of
the customer's credit rating, whether an individual or cor-
poration.

The counterparty for term deposits is generally assessed
by using the highest available rating, where possible, and
considering minimum rating requirements, in particular,
BBB for Group companies in countries classified as “in-
vestment grade”, or similar to the sovereign debt rating
in countries that have a rating below investment grade.

Repurchase agreements are mainly with bank counter-
parties with high credit ratings.

The carrying amount of bonds that do not have low credit
risk, considered as exposure with a rating lower than in-
vestment grade, is € 10,409 min.
