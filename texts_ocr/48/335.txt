This Board of Statutory Auditors has evaluated the pro-
cedures for concrete implementation of the Code in
question, with reference to the principles and application
criteria, and has no comments to make on them.

The Board of Statutory Auditors notes that the Board of
Directors has evaluated the operation, size and compo-
sition of the Board of Directors and the Board Commit-
tees. The Board Review process for the 2018 financial
year, which involved all Directors and the Chair of the
BSA, was conducted by means of a questionnaire de-
veloped by a main external consulting company, accom-
panied by interviews aimed at enhancing the individual
contribution of each Director. In order to ensure the con-
fidentiality of responses and monitor their consolidation
process, the results of the procedure were managed by
the external consultant who reported to the GSC and
Corporate Affairs Function. The results of the Board
review were presented, shared and discussed by the
Board of Directors in the meetings of 12 December 2018
and 30 January 2019, in which the Board of Statutory
Auditors took part.

The Board of Statutory Auditors acknowledges that, in
compliance with the recommendations of the Self-Gov-
ernance Code, the outcomes of the Board review have
been taken into consideration by the GSC and the Board
of Directors - supported by the ARC - for the purposes
of drafting the “Opinion for Shareholders on the size and
composition of the Board of Directors for the three-year
period 2019-2021”. This opinion was approved by the
Board of Directors on 20 February 2019, as previously
sent to the Board of Statutory Auditors, and was the
subject of prior publication with respect to the date of
the Shareholders’ Meeting called to appoint the Board
of Directors for the three-year period of 2019-2021, so
that the Shareholders could take the assessments car-
ried out by the BSA and its recommendations into ac-
count in the selection of the candidates with adequate
advance notice with respect to the last date of filing of
the lists.

In the early months of 2019, in line with the recommen-
dations of Regulation Q.1.1 of the Rules of Conduct of
the Board of Statutory Auditors of Listed Companies pre-
pared by the NCCA, the Board of Statutory Auditors also
carried out its own self-assessment of its composition
and operation with the support of the Corporate Affairs
Function, providing for the examination and discussion
of the related results in a specific meeting.

The Board of Statutory Auditors also checked on the cor-
rect application of the criteria and process initiated by the
Board of Directors to assess the independence of direc-
tors classed as “independent”; it also established that

its own independence requirements were met, sending
such to the Board of Directors are required by the Self-
Governance Code.

In light of the policies and operating guidelines provided
for by the Company, the Board of Directors conducted
its assessments of whether the independence require-
ment is met on the basis of all the information available
to the Company in any way, and on the basis of specific
supplementary declarations, designed to obtain from Di-
rectors stating themselves as independent precise, ac-
curate information about the existence of any commer-
cial, financial or professional relations, relations involving
self-employment or employment or other pecuniary or
professional relations, which are relevant as defined in
the Corporate Governance Code and the TUIF.

The BSA notes that the Board of Directors has adopted
a specific top management succession policy and plan.
The BSA has no comments to make about the consisten-
cy of the remuneration policy with the recommendations
of the Corporate Governance Code and its compliance
with IVASS Regulation n. 38/2018.
