Environmental challenges

Climate changes, a consequence of the global warming
caused by the anthropic emissions of greenhouse gases,
will produce direct or indirect effects that will become
increasingly evident as time goes by. This will lead to
increased risks. On the one hand, it is a question of
physical risks that involve not only increased volatility of
the weather events, but also ecological consequences,
which without adequate countermeasures might become
irreversible and have incalculable economic and social
effects. The insurance sector as well would be impacted,

with increased claims in coverage tied to the phenomena
influenced by the climate and, as a result, costs for the
related products. On the other hand, there will also be
transition risks for coping with the change. They include
new financial risks (e.g. creation of stranded assets), lower
revenues if leaving the segments tied to fossil fuels were
not to be offset by new flows, for example those arriving
from the production of sustainable energy or carbon
capture and storage. The environmental challenges also
pose reputational risks for those players that do not
manage them in the best way possible

 

 

 

M4

and our management

Considering our social role as insurer and institutional
investor and the underwriting risks to which we are
exposed, climate change is one of the major trends under
way for us, and is singled out as one of the emerging
risks for the insurance sector. In order to cope with this
situation, we constantly monitor the main perils and
territories to which the Group is exposed, using actuarial
models to estimate the damage that could result from
natural phenomena and thereby optimize our underwriting
strategy. We also measure the underwriting risks and the
risk arising from catastrophes using the Group’s internal
model, which allows us to better capture our risk profile.
We also adopt sustainability criteria for selecting our
investments and for the underwriting of new insurance
policies that are in line with the best and universally
recognized standards, even through the use of specific
third-party tools while analysing in detail and potentially

excluding business opportunities that are not consistent
with principles of environmental, social and governance
sustainability. We then utilize internal and external
monitoring processes of greenhouse gas emissions
associated with the activities in our investment portfolios
and of the insurance exposure to high carbon intensity
sectors.

We have published our climate change strategy that
includes concrete actions on our core business and
that explains our stance on coal and identifies ‘green’
opportunities in the investment and insurance activities.
We also take part in multi-stakeholder initiatives and
in technical round table discussions that facilitates the
analysis of the climate change’s impact in the insurance
sector and that undertake to promote the transition to a
low environmental impact society.
