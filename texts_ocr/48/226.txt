The following table shows the cumulative claim pay-
ments and the ultimate cost of claims by accident year
and their development from 2009 to 2018. The ultimate
cost includes paid losses, outstanding reserves on re-
ported losses, estimated reserves for IBNR claims and
ULAE.

The amount refers to direct business gross of reinsur-
ance and recoveries.

The difference between the ultimate cost of claims and
the cumulative paid losses for calendar year 2018 con-

stitutes the claim reserve for accident years 2009 to
2018. The reserve reported in the balance sheet also
includes a residual claim reserve that is composed al-
most exclusively by the accident years not reported in
the development triangle.

The observed trend in the ultimate cost for generations
2009-2018 indicates the adequate level of prudence
adopted by the Generali Group in its reserving policy.
