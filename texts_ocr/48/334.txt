cree 254/2016 on the disclosure of non-financial infor-
mation relating to environmental and social issues relat-
ing to personnel, respect for human rights and the fight
against corruption. The criteria of the International <IR>
Framework have also been applied in the preparation of
the CNFS, issued by the International Integrated Report-
ing Council (“IIRC”). The standard adopted for report-
ing on the material subjects identified by the Group is
represented by the GRI Sustainability Reporting Stand-
ard, published in 2016 by GRI Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI - Referenced claim) with reference to selected GRI
Standards and indicators of GRI G4 Financial Services
Sector Disclosures.

The BSA further noted that the auditing firm EY issued
said report on 03 April 2019. In said report, EY certified
that on the basis of the work performed, no information
had come to its attention suggesting that the CNFS was
not drawn up, in all significant respects, in compliance
with the terms of Arts. 3 and 4 of Legislative Decree no.
254/2016 and the reporting standard used by the Group
to prepare the CNFS.

The Board of Statutory Auditors observes that in the
course of the controls conducted and specified above,
no evidence of non-conformity by the CNFS with the leg-
islative provisions governing its preparation and publica-
tion came to its attention.

ment, the Company did not exercise the option to omit
information concerning imminent developments and
transactions under negotiation allowed by Art. 3, para. 8
of Legislative Decree 254/2016.
