Preliminary figures for 2018, official figures for 2017
(1) Financial risk includes spread risk for standard formula entities
(2) Credit risk includes default risk, spread widening and rating migration risks for PIM entities
(3) Within this category other regulated financial entities are included (e.g. |ORP, banks etc.)

The above SCR breakdown highlights that:

- financial and credit risks, account for the 68% of the
total SCR before diversification, due to the predomi-
nance of traditional life business;

— life and non-life underwriting risks, accounting for re-
spectively 11% and 13% of the total SCR before diver-
sification; within this CAT risks remain limited thanks to
a comprehensive reinsurance program;

— health underwriting risk deriving from standard formula
based entities accounting for 1% of the total SCR be-
fore diversification;

— operational risks contribute to the Group SCR for 7%.
This contribution is calculated using the standard for-
mula.

Each risk category is further detailed in the section D.
Risk Profile

Minimum Capital Requirement
Coverage

In addition to SCR coverage, the Group calculates the
Minimum Consolidated Group SCR (MCR) coverage. The
MCR calculation is required to determine the minimum
level of capital, under which the Group would be exposed
to an unacceptable level of risk when allowed to continue
its operations.

The preliminary’? Minimum Solvency Ratio stands at 256%
as at 31 December 2018, with an increase of +8 pps in
respect of previous year. In the following table, the MCR
coverage is reported.

10 On the basis of IVASS Prowvedimento n. 53, 2016, the SCR and MCR calculations to be disclosed in the Annual Report can rely on a preliminary estimate. More details on the

Solvency Ratio will be disclosed in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report.
