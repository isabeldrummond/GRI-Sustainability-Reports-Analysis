preferences) supporting the decision-making processes
as well as by risk tolerances providing quantitative bound-
aries to limit excessive risk-taking, as well as by a target
operating range to provide indications on the solvency
level at which the Group aims to operate. Tolerance and
target levels are referred to capital and liquidity metrics.

The Group RAF governance provides a framework for
embedding risk management into day-to-day and ex-
traordinary business operations and control mechanisms
as well as the escalation and reporting to be applied in
case of risk tolerance breaches. Should an indicator ap-
proach or breach the defined tolerance levels, escalation
mechanisms are activated.

4. Risk reporting

The purpose of risk reporting is to keep Senior
Management and AMSB aware and informed on the de-
velopment of the risk profile, the trends of single risks and
the breaches of risk tolerances on an ongoing basis.

The ORSA process includes the assessment and report-
ing of all risks also in a forward-looking view. The ORSA
process includes the assessment of all risks, quantifia-
ble and not in terms of capital requirements. Within the

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

ORSA, stress test and sensitivity analyses are also per-
formed to assess the resilience of the solvency position
and risk profile to changed market conditions or specific
risk factors.

Generali Group applies a Group-wide process, which
implies that each Group Legal Entitiy is responsible for
the preparation of its own ORSA Report and the Parent
Company coordinates the Group ORSA reporting pro-
cess.

At Group level, the process is coordinated by the Risk
Management Function, supported by other Functions for
what concerns Own Funds, technical provisions and oth-
er risks.

The purpose of the ORSA process is to provide the as-
sessment of risks and of the overall solvency needs on
a current and forward-looking basis. The ORSA process
ensures an ongoing assessment of the solvency posi-
tion based on the Strategic Plan and the Group Capital
Management Plan.

The Group ORSA Report, documenting main results of
this process, is produced on an annual basis. A non-reg-
ular ORSA Report can also be produced in case of signif-
icant changes of the risk profile.
