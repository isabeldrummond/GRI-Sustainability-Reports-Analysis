No active market exists for these investments,
so their fair value is determined through
methodologies and calculation models with a
high level of subjectivity when choosing the
assumptions, such as interest rates, yield
curves, credit spreads and dividend estimates;
therefore, we considered this aspect a key
matter for our audit.

Non-Life technical provisions estimation

The technical provisions of the non-life segment,
recorded at 31 December 2018 for an amount
equal to Eur 31,720 million, are accounted for
based on local GAAP applied by the individual
insurance companies of the Group in their
separate financial statements, since these
contracts fall within the scope of the IFRS 4 -
Insurance Contracts. In accordance with this
standard, no provisions for any future claims
were recognised, with the consequent
elimination of the equalisation provisions and
the additional components of the unearned
premiums reserve.

The financial statement information relating to
non-life insurance provisions is disclosed in the
explanatory notes in the section "Accounting
principles” and in note n. 13.

The valuation of the non-life technical provisions
is therefore a well-structured estimation process
that requires the use of complex methodologies
and statistical and actuarial calculation models,
characterized by a high level of subjectivity
when choosing the assumptions, such as the
frequency and average cost of the claims, used
as input to develop the estimate. This is further
highlighted in long-tail businesses such as
motor, which represent around 45% of total
provisions.

For these reasons, we considered this aspect a
key matter for our audit.

The audit response included several procedures,
the most relevant of which are outlined below:

* Anunderstanding of estimation process
of non-life technical provisions designed
by the Group and of the related key
controls, as well as the testing of these
controls; these procedures were carried
out with reference to the controls over
completeness, accuracy and
appropriateness of data related to the
insurance portfolio used to calculate the
non-life technical provisions, taking into
consideration also the control activities
performed by the actuarial function of
the Group and the related results;

e The evaluation of the appropriateness of
the methodologies and the
reasonableness of the assumptions used
to estimates the non-life technical
provisions, including the additional
technical provisions;

* Comparative analyses through the
calculation of appropriate indicators
observed historically and their
correlation with other significant
financial statements indicators, as well
as the consistency with other financial
statements information, the expected
values and the results determined in
previous financial years;

e The verification, for each line of
business deemed significant, that the
estimated amount of the technical
provisions is included in a range of
acceptable values, also through
independently reperforming of the
actuarial calculation, when applicable.
