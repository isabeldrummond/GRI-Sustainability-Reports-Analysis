Regulatory evolution packages of measures: the sustainable finance action

The insurance sector continues to be affected by
continuous changes in the national and international
regulatory system.

IVASS Regulation, no. 38 was issued in 2018, and it
entails an in-depth revision of the Group’s corporate
system and a few important corporate processes.

The IDD, the insurance intermediation directive, was also
applied in 2018.

Other important Regulation proposals completing the
regulatory framework introduced by the General Personal
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are presently being
discussed. They touch on themes such as the protection
of electronic communications (ePrivacy) and the free
circulation of non-personal data.

In a perspective of growth and creation of a true single
European market, discussions focused on defining rules
governing the PEPPs, the European voluntary pension
products that will join the already existing national
pension instruments, continue.

The European Commission also launched several

 

plan (including the obligation for asset managers to
take into account sustainability factors in the investment
processes), the one on opportunities that technological
innovation in the financial services (Fintech) offers
and lastly, a number of measures aimed at bolstering
consumer protection (New Deal for Consumers).

The revision of the Solvency II Directive and the Key
Information Document (KID) for the PRIIPS, the insurance
investment products, is currently in progress.

At the global level, the Common Framework (ComFrame)
works launched by the International Association of
Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) in order to develop standard
capital requirements for insurance groups operating
globally are continuing.

Lastly, as regards the new international accounting
standards, the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) has decided to postpone the entry into force of the
new accounting standard IFRS 17 (insurance contracts)
by one year, from 2021 to 2022, and to postpone also
exemption from applying the standard IFRS 9 (financial
instruments) for insurance companies until 2022.

 

 

 

and our management

We run our business in compliance with the law,
internal regulations and codes and professional ethics,
and we closely monitor the evolution of the regulatory
environment, dialoguing with legislators and institutions.
We regularly evaluate our exposure to the risk of non-
compliance and assume prompt measures to adequately
manage it.

We are implementing the requirements set out in the new
IVASS Regulation, no. 38, on the subject of corporate
governance, and we have adapted our business model
to the IDD and GDPR rules.

We are closing following developments in the proposals
put forward by the various institutions in order to assess
their possible risks and impacts, and also the opening of
new business scenarios and opportunities.

After having implemented the Solvency II requirements
and those concerning transparency of investment

a

products, we are closely monitoring the revision of these
two important regulations for the sector.

We are engaged in the various tests carried out by the
International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS)
to determine the final architecture and calibrations of the
supervisory requirement.

We are also following the developments of the new
international accounting standards entailing sizeable
operational impacts for the companies. As regards
these topics, we have developed an integrated Group
programme called Finance NEXT (Navigate to Excellence
Transformation) with the goal of optimally coordinating the
plans to implement the new IFRS accounting standards
(specifically, IFRS 9 on investments and IFRS 17 on
insurance contracts) and of speeding up the reporting
processes in line with the new regulatory deadlines.
This will allow the Group to manage the new regulatory
obligations that will have a very sizeable impact over the
years to come in an integrated manner.
