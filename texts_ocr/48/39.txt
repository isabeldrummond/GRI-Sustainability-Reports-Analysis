of the Group, as reflected in our values. Our remuneration policy reflects
and supports both our strategy and values: to be a global insurance Group
aiming at creating value and sustainable results, while valuing our people
and maintaining commitments to all stakeholders.

The remuneration policy for non-executive directors establishes that remuneration consists of a fixed component
as well as an attendance fee for each Board of Directors’ meeting in which they participate, in addition to the
reimbursement of expenses incurred for participation in such meetings. Directors who are also members of the Board
Committees are paid remuneration in addition to the amounts already received as members of the Board of Directors
(except for those who are also executives of the Generali Group), in accordance with the powers conferred to those
Committees and the commitment required in terms of number of meetings and preparation activities involved. This
remuneration is established by the Board of Directors. In line with the best international market practices, there is no
variable remuneration.

The Managing Director/Group CEO, the unique executive director, the members of the Group Management Committee
(GMC) and the other executives with key responsibilities receive a remuneration package consisting of a fixed component,
a variable component with no-claims bonus and claw back mechanisms, and benefits.
