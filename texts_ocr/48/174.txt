Investment contracts

Investment contracts without DPF and that do not

have a significant investment risk, mainly include unit/

index-linked policies and pure capitalization contracts.

These products are accounted for in accordance with

IAS 39 as follows:

- the products are recognised as financial liabilities at
fair value or at amortised cost. In detail, linked prod-
ucts classified as investment contracts are fair valued
through profit or loss, while pure capitalization policies
are generally valued at amortised cost;

— fee and commission income and expenses are recog-
nised in the profit and loss account. Specifically, IAS 39
and IAS 18 require that they are separately identified
and classified in the different components of: (i) origi-
nation, to be charged in the profit and loss account at
the date of the issue of the product; and (ii) investment
management service, to be recognised throughout the
whole policy term by reference to the stage of comple-
tion of the service rendered;

— fee and commission income and incremental costs of
pure capitalization contracts without DPF (other than
administration costs and other non-incremental costs)
are included in the amortised cost measurement;

— the risk component of linked products is unbundled,
if possible, and accounted for as insurance contracts

Life insurance provisions

Life insurance provisions are related to insurance con-
tracts and investment contracts with discretionary par-
ticipation features. These provisions are accounted for
based on local GAAP, in compliance with IFRS 4.

Liabilities related to insurance contracts and investment
contracts with discretionary participation features are
determined analytically for each kind of contract on the
basis of appropriate actuarial assumptions. They meet all
the existing commitments based on best estimates.

These actuarial assumptions take into consideration the
most recent demographic tables of each country where
the risk is underwritten, aspects of mortality, morbidity,
determination of risk-free rates, expenses and inflation.
The tax charge is based on laws in force.

Among life insurance provisions, provisions in addition
to mathematical provisions, already envisaged by the lo-
cal regulations in case of adverse changes in the interest

rates or mortality, are classified as provisions for the lia-
bility adequacy test.

As previously mentioned, insurance provisions include
deferred policyholder liabilities related to contracts with
DPF. The recognition of the deferred policyholder liabil-
ities is made in accordance to shadow accounting, as
already mentioned in paragraph “Shadow accounting” of
section Insurance Provision.

Liability adequacy test (LAT)

In accordance with IFRS 4, in order to verify the ade-
quacy of the reserves a Liability Adequacy Test (LAT) is
performed. The aim of the test is to verify if the technical
provisions - inclusive of deferred policyholders liabilities
- are adequate to cover the current value of future cash
flows related to insurance contracts.

The liability adequacy test is performed through the com-
parison of the IFRS reserves (which include the impact
of “shadow accounting”), net of any deferred acquisition
costs or intangible assets related to these contracts, with
the current value of future cash flows related to insurance
contracts.

The abovementioned amount also includes the costs of
embedded financial options and guarantees, which are
measured with a market-consistent methodology. Tech-
nical reserves which are subject to the Liability Adequacy
Test also include the interest rate risk provisions as re-
quired by local regulations.

The insurance contracts modelling and best estimates
assumptions used are consistent with the evaluation
process of the insurance provisions in accordance with
Solvency Il and subject to audit process in compliance
with the current regulation.

Each inadequacy is charged to the profit and loss ac-
count, initially reducing deferred acquisition costs and
value of business acquired, and subsequently account-
ing for a provision.

Non-life insurance provisions

The local GAAP for each country is applied to non-life
insurance provisions, since all the existing policies fall
under IFRS 4 scope. In conformity with the international
standard, no provisions for future claims are recognised,
