In the opposite case, the fair value of derivatives is de-
termined using internal valuation models or provided by
third parties. In particular, the fair value is determined
primarily on the basis of income approach using deter-
ministic or stochastic models of discounted cash flows
commonly shared and used by the market.

The main input used in the valuation include volatility,
interest rates, yield curves, credit spreads, dividend es-
timates and exchange rates observed at frequent inter-
vals.

With reference to the fair value adjustment for credit and
debt risk of derivatives (credit and debt valuation adjust-
ment CVA / DVA), the Group considered this adjustment
as not material for the valuation of its positive and neg-
ative derivatives, as almost entirely of them is collater-
alized. Their evaluation does not take into account for
these adjustments.

- Financial assets where the investment risk is borne by
the policyholders and related to pension funds

Generally, if available and if the market is defined as ac-
tive, fair value is equal to the market price. On the contra-
ry, valuation methodologies listed above for the different
asset classes shall be used.

— Financial liabilities

Generally, if available and if the market is defined as ac-
tive, fair value is equal to the market price.

The fair value is determined primarily on the basis of the
income approach using discounting techniques.

In particular, the fair value of debt instruments issued by
the Group are valued using discounted cash flow mod-
els based on the current marginal rates of funding of the
Group for similar types of loans, with maturities consist-
ent with the maturity of the debt instruments subject to
valuation.

The fair value of other liabilities relating to investment
contracts is determined using discounted cash flow
models that incorporate several factors, including the
credit risk embedded derivatives, volatility, servicing
costs and redemptions. In general, however, are subject
to the same valuation techniques used for financial as-
sets linked policies.

Accounting for derivatives

Derivatives are financial instruments or other contracts

with the following characteristics:

- their value changes in response to the change in interest
rate, security price, commodity price, foreign exchange
rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or other
pre-defined underlying variables;

— they require no initial net investment or, if necessary,
an initial net investment that is smaller than one which
would be required for other types of contracts that
would be expected to have a similar response to chang-
es in market factors;

— they are settled at a future date. Derivatives are classi-
fied as at fair value through profit or loss.

According to this accounting model the portion of the
gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined
to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in an ap-
propriate item of comprehensive income while the inef-
fective portion of the gains or loss on the hedging instru-
ment is recognized in profit or loss.

The amount accumulated in the other components of
comprehensive income is reversed to profit and loss ac-
count in line with the economic changes of the hedged
item.

When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, or the
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting,
the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instruments,
that remains recognized directly in the other components
of other comprehensive income from the period when the
hedge was effective, remains separately recognized in
comprehensive income until the forecast transaction oc-
curs. However, if the forecasted transaction is no longer
expected to occur, any related cumulative gain or loss on
the hedging instrument that remains recognized directly
in the other components of comprehensive income from
the period when the hedge was effective is immediately
recognized in profit or loss.

With reference to emissions of some subordinated lia-
bilities, the Group has entered into hedging transactions
of the interest rates volatility and exchange rate fluctua-
tions GBP/EURO, which for accounting purposes is des-
ignated as hedging the volatility of cash flows (cash flow
hedge) and accounted adopting the hedge accounting
technique.
