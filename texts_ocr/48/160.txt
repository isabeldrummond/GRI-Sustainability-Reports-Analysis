Accounting principles

The accounting standards adopted in preparing the con-
solidated financial statements, and the contents of the
items in the financial statements are presented in this
section.

New accounting principles, changes
in the accounting rules and in the
financial statements

Following the endorsement of the European Union, as
from the 1st January 2018 new principles and amend-
ments shall be applied. The most relevant changes for
the Group with respect to the consolidated financial
statements at 31 December 2017 are described below. In
addition, the main documents issued by the International
Accounting Standard Board, that could be relevant for
the Group, but not yet effective, are described.

New accounting principles, changes
in the accounting rules that shall be
applied from 1 January 2018

There are no new accounting standards or changes to
existing standards effective from 1 January relevant for
the Group. The changes which become applicable are
not significant for the Group and are indicated in the cor-
responding specific section, after the new accounting
standards and changes that are not yet effective, below.

IFRS 15 — Revenue from contracts with
customers

IFRS 15 “Revenue form contracts with customers”,
which treats revenue recognition, is effective from 1 Jan-
uary 2018 and replaces IAS 11 “Construction Contracts”
and IAS 18 “Revenue”, and includes new requirements
concerning the measurement and timing of revenue rec-
ognition

Insurance contracts are excluded from the scope of the
standard; as a result the potential impacts for insurance
companies are connected to contracts that include
non-insurance services and management fees.

In particular IFRS 15 defines the following steps:

— Step 1: Identifying contracts

— Step 2: Identifying performance obligations

— Step 3: Determining the transaction price

— Step 4: Allocating the transaction price to performance

obligations
— Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity sat-
isfies a performance obligation.

An entity shall recognise revenue when (or as) the en-
tity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a
promised good or service (ie an asset) to a customer. An
asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains
control of that asset.

The transfer of control of the asset is the key element of
the revenue recognition, which may be point-in-time or
over time.

Revenue is recognized “point-in-time”, as the control of
the asset is passed, or “over time”, during the period. The
revenues are recognized “over time” if one of the following
criteria is met:

1) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes
all of the benefits provided by the entity as the entity
performs;

2) the entity’s performance creates or enhances an as-
set that the customer controls as the asset is created;

3) the entity’s performance does not creates an asset
with an alternative use to the entity and the entity
has an enforceable right to payment for performance
completed to date.

The Generali Group is a predominantly insurance group.
The revenues arising from this business are defined by
IFRS 4 “Insurance contracts”; the other revenues arising
from the sale of goods and services different from finan-
cial and insurance services, and arising from asset man-
agement are defined and disciplined by IFRS 15. These
revenues are included in the income statement item
“Other revenues”. In particular, within Generali Group,
entities specialized in in banking, asset management and
other residual businesses included in the segment “Hold-
ing and other activities” operates.

Revenues from contracts with customers for Generali
Group are mainly financial and real estate asset manager,
investment and pension funds commissions, as well as
service and assistance. These revenues are not multi-an-
nual and recognized on accrual basis during the finan-
cial year, and included in the item “Commission Income”
(note 27). In some cases, in particular in case of asset
and pension fund management, the revenues are linked
to managed amounts or to the performance of the as-
sets. Despite this, significant judgements in estimate and
measurement of revenues has been rarely needed, i.e. for
the definition of transfer price, timing etc.

Within the Group, there are also other entities which op-
