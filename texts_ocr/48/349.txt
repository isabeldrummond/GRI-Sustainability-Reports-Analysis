of the financial debt outstanding as at the reporting date,
weighted for the nominal amount.

ment technological systems capable of meeting needs

chasing data.

ey-market investment funds, which are included in the
Group liquidity management.

Climate change and natural disasters: climate change is
already taking place and natural disasters are on the rise,

ening the resilience of communities.

Cor, combined ratio: it is a technical performance indica-
tor of Property & Casualty segment, calculated as the ra-
tio of net insurance benefits and claims as well as admin-
istration and acquisition costs to net earned premiums. In
other words, it is the sum of loss ratio and expense ratio.

Current year loss ratio: it is a further detail of combined

ratio calculated as the ratio of:

Customer: either a physical person or a legal entity that
holds at least one active insurance policy and pays a
premium to Generali accordingly, a banking product or
a pension fund product (the policy/the product is either
with Generali, or other non-Generali local brand, or white
labelled).

Customer T-NPS (Transactional Net Promoter System):
NPS approach to get a systematic feedback from cus-
tomers after specific transactions (purchase, claims han-
dling, etc.) selected locally. A survey is sent via email to
customers to assess their propensity to recommend — or
not - Generali to their closest persons (family members,
friends and colleagues) using a scale from 0 to 10. Thanks
to this feedback, the company is able to identify detrac-
tors (rating from 0 to 6), passives (rating of 7 or 8) and
promoters (rating of 9 or 10). Each detractor is system-
atically called back by a member of Generali to under-
stand the problem faced and solve it (quick wins). Those
problems that have a more structural nature - and need,
for example a revision of core processes and practices or
investments - are addressed and solved in a cross-func-
tional working group (structural improvements), with the
aim to provide an outstanding customer experience.
