etc.), additional reinforcement of the internal control
system has been planned, with specific joint actions
by the Group Audit and Group Compliance Functions.

The aforementioned activities will be subject to specific
monitoring by the Board of Statutory Auditors during the
2019 financial year.

In light of all the above information and having regard to
the above-mentioned areas of attention and taking the
development of ICRMS into account, no factors emerged
from the analyses conducted or the information obtained
that could lead this BSA to consider the Company's In-
ternal Control and Risk Management System as not ad-
equate as a whole.

5.2. Administrative accounting system
and financial reporting process.

As regards the administrative accounting system and the
financial reporting process, the Board of Statutory Audi-
tors monitored (inter alia) the Company’s activities de-
signed to assess their adequacy and effective operation
on a continuous basis.

The Company pursued this objective by adopting a “fi-
nancial reporting model” consisting of a set of principles,
rules and procedures designed to guarantee an ade-
quate administrative and accounting system. In line with
the Company’s ICRMS, the financial reporting model in-
volves the corporate bodies and operating and control
structures in integrated management, in compliance with
the different levels of responsibility. The main character-
istics of the model are described in the Corporate Gov-
ernance and Share Ownership Report.

Data and information relevant to the performance of their
respective tasks pursuant to Art. 150, para. 3, TUIF and
Art. 74, para. 3(e) of IVASS Regulation n. 38/2018 were
exchanged with the managers of the auditing firm, and
no noteworthy aspects emerged.

At the meeting of 25 March 2019, the Board of Statutory
Auditors examined the draft of the additional report pre-
pared by the auditing company EY pursuant to Art. 11 of
EU Regulation 537/2014, which reported no significant
shortcomings of the internal control system in relation
to the financial reporting process. That report was dis-
cussed and analysed during information exchanges be-
tween the Board of Statutory Auditors and auditing firm.
As part of its role to oversee the suitability of the adminis-
trative-accounting system, the BSA also established, pur-
suant to Art. 15 of the Market Regulation of 28 December
2017, that the Company’s organisation and the proce-

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

dures adopted enable the Company to establish that the
companies controlled and incorporated by it which are
governed by the legislation of countries not belonging to
the European Union and are required to comply with the
Consob regulations have an administrative/accounting
system suitable to supply the Company’s management
and external auditors regularly with the economic, capital
and financial data required to draw up the consolidated
financial statements. At 31 December 2018, the following
are non-EU companies relevant for the purposes of the
Market Regulation: Generali Personenversicherungen
AG, Generali (Schweiz) Holding AG and Generali China
Life Insurance Co. Ltd.

5.3. Consolidated Non-Financial
Statement

The Board of Statutory Auditors points out that, pursuant
to Legislative Decree no. 254/2016 and the related imple-
menting regulation issued by CONSOB with resolution
no. 20267 of 18 January 2018, the Company is required
to prepare and publish a Consolidated Non-Financial
Statement (“CNFS”). As required by Art. 4 of Legisla-
tive Decree no. 254/2016, said Statement provides non-
financial information relating to the Company and its
subsidiaries “to the extent required to ensure compre-
hension of the group’s business, trend and results, and
the impact produced by it”.

As specified in Art. 3, para.7 of Legislative Decree no.
254/2016, the Board of Statutory Auditors, in the perfor-
mance of its statutory functions, monitored compliance
with the legislation governing the preparation and pub-
lication of the CNFS. In particular, the BSA supervised
the adequacy of the organisational structures adopted
by the Group based on the strategic objectives it pur-
sued in the social-environmental field, and on the ad-
equacy of the processes and structures that govern the
production, reporting, measurement and representa-
tion of non-financial results and information within the
Group.

To this end, the BSA examined the documentation
made available by the Company and met the manage-
ment team responsible for the CNFS disclosure on vari-
ous occasions, an interdisciplinary group that includes
the Group CFO and Group Risk Management as well as
the representatives of the auditing company appointed
to carry out the statutory audit, which is also entrusted
with the task of giving the declaration of conformity pro-
vided for by Art. 3, paragraph 10, of Legislative Decree
no. 254/2016 in a specific report.

The Board of Directors approved the CNFS on 13 March
