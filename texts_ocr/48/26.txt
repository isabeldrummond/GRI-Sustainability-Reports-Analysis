We also have a structured internal Group regulatory system, regulated by the Generali Internal Regulation System
(GIRS) Policy. The Group regulations cover the internal control system and governance as well as the risk management
system - in particular, linked to monitoring solvency (Solvency Il) - in addition to the primary areas of financial and
non-financial risk.

The primary compliance risks are monitored through specific programs spread throughout the Group.

We regularly monitor - by means of specific risk assessment activities - our exposure to these risks with the aim of
minimizing potential reputational and economic damages deriving from the violation of regulatory provisions, including
those which aim to prevent corruption.

We condemn and combat all forms of corruption and financial crime. We have made available communication channels
(Group Compliance Helpline) to our employees, customers and suppliers, even in anonymous format, which ensure
an objective and independent management of reports of behaviour or actions which might violate law, the Code of
Conduct and the related Group Rules or other internal rules, in accordance with the Process on managing reported
concerns and the whistleblowing policy which we have been applying for years. These channels are active 24 hours a
day. We have also adopted a rigorous policy against retaliations.
