Dear reader, dear Generali shareholder,

Although 2018 was a challenging year for many economies, especially in
Europe, Generali has once again achieved excellent results. The Group
closed the year with improvements in premium income, technical and
operating performance and net profit. These results made it possible to
meet, and in some cases even exceed, the expectations of the 2016-2018
strategic plan, demonstrating the Group’s excellent execution capacity and
its tireless commitment to excellence.

Indeed, the Group optimised its geographical positioning by concentrating
its presence within the most promising markets in which it has - or expects
to have - a leadership position, while also generating considerably more
proceeds from disposals than estimated. It streamlined its operating
machine, generating synergies and boosting productivity, resulting in a
faster than expected reduction in operating costs in mature markets. It
improved its technical capacities, consolidating performance leadership with
respect to its competitors, and rebalanced the portfolio towards capital-light
products within a low interest rate environment. It also started to implement
its asset management strategy. By so doing, Generali strengthened its
profitability and resilience in the face of market fluctuations and was able to
improve customer loyalty and the degree of preference for the brand.

In line with the Group’s culture of sustainability and long-term outlooks,

and with the mutualistic approach at the basis of the insurance business,
Generali published its Annual Integrated Report for the sixth consecutive
year. Aside from the usual financial information, the Report provides a non-
financial disclosure on social, environmental and governance matters, the
importance of which is also reflected in the Group’s purpose: enable people
to shape a safer future by caring for their lives and dreams.
