| 66 | Generali Group Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

Generali has also been operating in the Hong Kong market since 1980, offering both Life
and P&C products. Hong Kong is also the location of the regional office (Generali Asia
Regional Office), which coordinates all activities in the region.

Lastly, it is pointed out that the P&C business in Japan is in run-off, and new business
was interrupted starting from the first quarter of 2018.

Life premiums showed a 28.2% growth recorded in most countries, and in China in
particular for savings and pure risk and protection policies, and Hong Kong, whose
newly established company has greatly increased production levels.

New production in terms of PVNBP eas up (+ 5.3%) thanks to the development of
single premiums (+ 27.0%) which largely offset the decline in the current value of future
regular premiums (-6.2%). Growth concerned all countries except Indonesia (-24.8%);
in particular good increases were observed in Hong Kong (+ 87.8%) and in Thailand
(+ 20.6%), while China is stable (+ 0.4%). With reference to the business lines, there
was an increase in risk products (+ 10.1%) and in the savings business (+ 9.0%), while
unit-linked products fell (-22.6%). The profitability of the new businss (expressed as
a percentage of the PVNBP) recorded a decrease from 7.00% in 2017 to 6.02% in
2018, conditioned by the negative performance of China, where a savings business with
reduced margins weighs compared to previous year, and from the decline of Indonesia
and Thailand; the development of profitability in Hong Kong was very positive.

The value of new business amounted to € 123 million, down by 9.8%

In the P&C segment, premiums grew by 2.6%, thanks to non-motor line. The negative
impact of the A&H and motor businesses in Thailand determined an increase in the
combined ratio of the Region, which amounted to 104.5%.
