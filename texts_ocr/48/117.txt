In 2019, current economic growth trends are expected
to slow on the whole. In the Eurozone, GDP growth is
expected to decline to 1.0%, from 1.9% in 2018. In any
event, some critical situations may significantly impact
this trend: Brexit, renewed tensions concerning the Italian
government spread, trade relations between the USA and
China and USA tariffs on European cars. In this context,
we expect the European Central Bank to closely monitor
inflation to decide when to implement the first rate hike,
which may take place not earlier than mid-2020.

In the United States, a slowdown is expected in the
current phase of expansion, due to the more restrictive
monetary policy and the elimination of tax stimulus meas-
ures. The job market, at full employment, will continue
to support wage growth. The Federal Reserve indicated
that it intends to normalise monetary policy toward a less
aggressive stance; a wait-and-see approach associated
with the future trend of economic indicators will prevail,
and consequently less predictable.

In the financial markets, long-term rates are expected to
rise in the bond segment. Considerable volatility is ex-
pected in the stock markets this year due to the reduction
in monetary stimulus, higher bond yields, expectations of
lower economic growth and the various external risks
negatively affecting the political and economic scenario.

As regards the insurance sector, in 2019 performance in
the Life segment is expected to be slightly worse than
in 2018, with a lower growth rate in unit-linked prod-
ucts than witnessed in recent years, while traditional
products could arouse renewed interest due to the rate
hike. Growth in the P&C segment will continue in major
Eurozone countries despite the slight economic slow-
down forecast.

Again in 2018 the international insurance market record-
ed a certain frequency of considerable natural catastro-
phe claims which concerned the reinsurance segment to
a significant extent, particularly in the second half of the
year: hurricanes in the USA-Caribbean area, typhoons
in Asia and the devastating forest fires in California. The
reinsurance segment demonstrated its ability to absorb
this new wave of claims, recording, although selective-
ly and linked to the results achieved, growth in the ret-
rocession market. The Group was able to benefit from
favourable conditions due to its centralized reinsurance
structure which allows for greater control over risk reten-
tion levels and good diversification in reinsurer portfoli-
os. There were minimal increases or there will be in 2019
only on agreements with a higher claims frequency, as
well as a higher corporate risk reinsurance cost, although
against broader coverage aimed at better controlling re-
sult volatility.

In the Life segment, the Group will continue with its strat-
egy of rebalancing that portfolio to further strengthen
profitability, with a more efficient capital allocation ap-
proach. The Generali brand continues to be consolidated
by simplifying and innovating the range of product solu-
tions which will be marketed through the most suitable,
efficient and modern distribution channels that are in-
creasingly based on digital processes. As a result, actions
dedicated to Life portfolio enhancement are confirmed:

— new business growth based on the selective develop-
ment of sustainable business lines such as protection
and health, and on capital-light savings and investment
insurance solutions. The development of these lines
will aim at offering a wide range of insurance solutions
adapted to risk and investment profiles for the benefit
of both the policyholders and the Group. In particular,
for products in the protection and health line, we aim
to offer modular solutions in which traditional risk cov-
erage is combined with substantial service packages
for an even more concrete management and resolution
of the critical issues covered. Amongst the capital-light
products, unit-linked target products are increasingly
characterized by financial mechanisms that are capa-
ble of coping with potential market crashes (e.g. selec-
tion of volatility-controlled funds);

— with regard to in-force business, actions dedicated to
strengthening relations with existing customers on the
basis of an updated analysis of current insurance needs;

- actions on the Life portfolio in general, which will have
a new important focus on senior customers, a market
segment with substantial development potential.

The Group will follow up on the positive results of the re-

balancing of the business mix while emphasizing the fo-

cus on market positioning in terms of premiums. Premium
trends will continue to reflect a careful underwriting poli-
cy, in line with the common Group goals that are driven by

a focus on the central importance of customers’ interest,

as well as the value of the products and the risk appetite

framework.

In the P&C segment, premiums are forecasted to improve
in the primary geographical areas of operation of the
Generali Group, with a significant focus on high growth
potential markets.

The motor business will basically remain stable, although
impacted by strong competitive pressure due to the
digital transformation, with possible impacts from the
business perspective on both volumes and profits. The
Generali’s aim is to continue to develop innovative insur-
ance solutions while maintaining its leadership in the tele-
matics market and guaranteeing growth in this business
line’s profitability.
