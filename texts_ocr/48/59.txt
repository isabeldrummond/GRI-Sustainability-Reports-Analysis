Generali holds the leadership in the Italian insurance market with an overall share of
16.2% thanks to the complete range of insurance solutions the Group offers its clients
in both the Life and P&C segments. At the distribution level, a multi-channel strategy
strongly hinged on agents has been developed. It has a strong position in the direct Life
and P&C channel, through Genertel and Genertellife, the first online insurance launched
in Italy. Thanks to its partnership with Banca Generali, the Group is able to offer its
customers a broad and complete variety of insurance, pension and savings products.
Generali presents itself on the Italian market with three distinct brands marked by a
clear strategic positioning - Generali (retail market and SME), Alleanza (households) and
Genertel and Genertellife (alternative channels).

During 2018, Generali Italia further developed its simplification programme with the goal
to improve the customer experience by simplifying the relationship between customers
and agents for the entire process by providing more and more accessible and innovative
services. Furthermore, at the end of 2018 Generali Italia launched Jeniot, a company
that develops innovative services in the Internet of Things and connected insurance
area tied to mobility, home, health and work.

Within The Human Safety Net, the Group’s global initiative for the society, Generali
Italian launched Ora di Futuro, an innovative project for educating children and families
that involves teachers, primary schools and non-profit networks throughout Italy. The
purpose is to help families sustain responsible growth of their children.

In 2018, the Italian Life insurance market enjoyed a +2.1% growth, recovering over
last year. The new Life business continues to be mostly oriented toward traditional
products, which have experienced an increase with respect to the previous year
(+8.4%); the support of the unit-linked products is decreasing (-4.5%), also because
of the volatility experienced in the financial markets. The P&C market too has recorded
a+2.4% growth. The motor business was affected by the heavy competition between
the different operators of the segment and was driven by the other damages business
(+5.3%) while MTPL continued its slow recovery (+0.7%). Benefitting from the moderate
macroeconomic recovery, positive growth rates (+3.1%) continued to be seen in the
non-motor business. The health risk trend was positive (+7.3%), marked by growing
attention to the world of welfare.

With reference to the financial markets, the ten-year BTP yield jumped from 2.0%
in 2017 to 2.8% at year-end 2018. The BTP-Bund spread widened from 153 bps of
year-end 2017 to 253 bps of year-end 2018, making a return from the peaks hit in
November following the agreements between the European Commission and the Italian
government, which sized down the plans to increase spending.

The equity market was affected by the global monetary policies and the intrinsic
country-ltaly risk. The FTSE MIB posted negative performance during the year (-16%).

The growth of Generali’s Life premiums shows the excellent performance of protection
premiums (+18.3%) and traditional savings products (+8.2%), while unit-linked products
(-2.4%) were affected by the volatility in financial markets that characterized the second
half of the year.
