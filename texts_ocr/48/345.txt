Responsibilities of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the

Consolidated Financial Statements

The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a
true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union and with the Regulation issued to implement article 90 of the Legislative Decree dated
7 September 2005, n. 209, and, within the terms provided by the law, for such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concer and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Parent Company

The statutory audit committee ("collegio sindacale") is responsible, within the terms provided by the
law, for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designed and performed audit procedures
