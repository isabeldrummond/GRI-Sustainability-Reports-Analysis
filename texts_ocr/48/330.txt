Business Units. While the GHO acts as a strategic guid-

ance structure, it leads and coordinates the Business

Units, which value entrepreneurship and local autonomy.

Organisational governance takes place through integra-

tion and coordination mechanisms between the Busi-

ness Units and the Group Head Office functions, repre-
sented by:

- the Group Management Committee (“GMC”), which
supports the Group CEO and top management in shar-
ing the main strategic decisions;

— the three main cross-functional committees that sup-
port the Group CEO in addressing the Group’s stra-
tegic decisions: Balance Sheet Committee, Finance
Committee, Product & Underwriting Committee;

- Business Strategic Reviews, Clearance Meetings and
Capital & Cash Deep Dives, which ensure the align-
ment between the GHO and the Business Units with a
respective focus on strategic actions and discussions,
economic-financial performance, remittance and capi-
tal optimisation;

- the Functional Guidelines and Functional Councils,
through which functional coordination is implemented
at global level;

- amatrix system of reporting lines, classified as “solid”
or “dotted” according to the intensity of guidance and
coordination between the GHO Functions and the
corresponding functions in the Business Units. The
“solid” departments, which have hierarchical report-
ing that is carried out more directly and systematically
by the GHO, are the Group Chief Risk Officer, Group
General Counsel, including Group Compliance and
the Group Audit; the other Group Functions are “dot-
ted”.

On 31 July 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors ap-

proved the adoption of a new organisational model, ef-

fective as of 1 September 2018. This new model involved:

— the creation of the position of General Manager, report-
ing directly to the Group CEO, to which Frédéric de
Courtois was appointed;

— the re-definition of the scope of the role of CEO of GBL
& International, renamed CEO International; this posi-
tion is held by Jaime Anchustegui;

— the extension of the scope of responsibility of Marco
Sesana, Country Manager Italy, to include Global Busi-
ness Lines, as well as the extension of the scope of re-
sponsibility of Jean-Laurent Granier, Country Manager
France, to include Europ Assistance;

— the appointment of Cristiano Borean as the new Group
CFO, following the termination of the employment
relationship between the Company and the previous
Group CFO, Luigi Lubelli. Cristiano Borean therefore
also joined the GMC.

5.1. Internal Control and Risk
Management System

The main features of the internal control and risk man-
agement system are described in the Report on Cor-
porate Governance and Ownership Structure and the
Group Risk Report (included in the Annual Integrated Re-
port and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018).

The internal control and risk management system
(“ICRMS”) is formed by the rules, procedures and cor-
porate structures that operate - also in regard to the role
of the Company as the parent company of an insurance
group - in order to allow the effective functioning of the
Company and Group, and to identify, manage and moni-
tor the main risks to which they are exposed. The ICRMS
is an integrated system that involves the entire organisa-
tional structure.

The Group Audit, Group Compliance, Group Risk Man-
agement, and Group Actuarial Functions constitute the
Fundamental Functions pursuant to IVASS Regulation
no. 38/2018. In order to ensure a consistent approach at
a Group level, the Company defines the Group guidelines
on the governance system supplemented by the inter-
