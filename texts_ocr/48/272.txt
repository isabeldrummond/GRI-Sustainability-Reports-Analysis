Risk Report | Outlook | Statement

Performance levels are expressed as percent satisfaction
of the target levels linked to each of the four indicators.

The actual percentage of accrual of the shares that can
be potentially allotted are therefore calculated individually
for each target basket (indicator and relevant weighting)
using the linear interpolation between the performances
actually achieved and the target levels.

Overall, the total number of shares, either allotted or in
the process of accruing, amounted to about 90 thou-
sand, for a total value of 1.7 million euros, of which 0.6
million euros already recognised through profit and loss.

commitments, guarantees, pledged
assets and collaterals

47.1 Contingent liabilities

assets and liabilities). As at 31 December 2018 the esti-
mate of the contingent liabilities results as of € 3 million,
mainly related to some disputes for which the probability
of occurrence is not considered as remote, however not
sufficiently material to recognise them as liabilities on the
balance sheet.

A contingent liability is:

- a possible obligation that arise from past events and
whose existence will be confirmed only by occurrence
or non occurrence of one or more uncertain future
events not wholly within the control of the entity; or

— apresent obligation that arises from past events but is
not recognized because:

(i) it is not probable than an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation; or

(ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured
with sufficient reliability.

47.2 Commitments

Generali Group at 31 December 2018 held outstanding
commitments for a total amount of € 8,900 million, relat-
ed to potential commitments on investments, loans and
other commitments.

Because part of these commitments may expire without
being called, the amounts disclosed are not indicative
of the actual liquidity needs arising from these commit-
ments.

In particular, € 6,108 million represent commitments as-
sociated with alternative investments (private equity),
mainly allocated in private equity funds which are con-
solidated line-by-line by the Group. Moreover, € 1,925
million refer to several investment opportunities and, in
particular, to real estate investment funds. The potential
commitments to grant loans amount to € 342 million,
mainly associated to liquidity or funding needs of the
customers of the Group’s banking operations.

As far as other commitments are concerned, the main
part that amounted totally to € 384 million refesr to po-
tential commitments of the German life companies to-
wards a specific German entity in order to protect the
policyholders in the local market if the funds already
available within the policyholders protection scheme are
not sufficient to face the insolvency of one or more in-
surers.
