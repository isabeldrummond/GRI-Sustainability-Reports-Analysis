accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors;

« we have concluded on the appropriateness of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion, Our conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;

« we have evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation,

* we have obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of
the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the
group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We have communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as
required by ISA Italia, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit,

We have provided those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the
ethical and independence requirements applicable in Italy, and we have communicated with them all
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we have determined those
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period
and are therefore the key audit matters. We have described these matters in our auditor's report.
