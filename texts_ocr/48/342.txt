Key Audit Matters

Valuation of goodwill

At 31 December 2018, goodwill amounted to
Eur 6,680 million. Based on IAS 36 -
Impairment of Assets, goodwill is measured at
cost less any impairment losses. At least
annually, the Group carries out an impairment
test, comparing the recoverable amount of each
Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which goodwill
was attributed to with the corresponding
carrying amount. The recoverable amount is
represented by the higher between the fair
value and the value in use determined by the
Group through the Dividend Discount Model
(DDM).

The financial statement information relating to
goodwill is disclosed in the explanatory notes in
the section “Accounting principles” and in note
n. 4,

The DDM requires the use of assumptions with a
high level of subjectivity, such as flows of
dividends extrapolated from business plans,
nominal growth rates and cost of capital.
Furthermore, the persistence of low interest rate
level, in past years, in many of the countries
where the Group operates has led to a decrease
in the profitability of CGUs of the life segment,
representing more than 50% of the total
amount, and, therefore, a reduction in the
surplus between the carrying amount and the
recoverable amount,

For these reasons, we considered this aspect a
key matter for our audit.

Evaluation of complex or non-listed financial
investments

At 31 December 2018, the consolidated
financial statements included Eur 26,226
million and Eur 9,126 million categorised
respectively as level 2 and level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy stated by IFRS 13 - Fair Value
Measurement.

The financial statement information relating to
investments is disclosed in the explanatory
