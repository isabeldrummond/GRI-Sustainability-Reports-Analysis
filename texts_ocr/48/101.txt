Commenting the Group Own Funds components, it can

be noted that:

— the decrease of the excess of assets over liabilities
(€ -1,295 million) is mainly attributable to the payment
of the 2017 dividend made during 2018;

— the reduction of the subordinated debt eligible in Basic
Own Funds is due to € 250 million of early redemption
occurred during 2018;

- foreseeable dividends are deducted for an amount of
€ -1,413 million;

- the reduced contribution of the unrealised gains on
IORP business (€ -770 million) stems from their pro-
gressive yearly haircut required by the French regulator;

- change of deductions for participations in sectoral enti-
ties (€ -446 million) are driven by the lower value (quot-

ed market price) of the participation in Banca Generali;
— filter for non-availability and minorities items and other
deductions decrease Group Own Funds for an amount
of € -1,389 million;
- the increased contribution of sectoral entities (€ 179
million) reflects the higher capital held by Group entities
operating within the financial segment.
