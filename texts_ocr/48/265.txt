Generali Group adopted multi-year plans, based on one
cycle of three years. Once the cycle reaches its conclu-
sion, participants may be granted a certain number of
free shares, again assuming certain targets have been
achieved, subject to specific holding/lock up periods.

The plan LT! 2015 has fully accrued its relevant cost com-
ponent in the first half of the year, coming to a close with
the equity instruments assignment upon verification of
the Group’s performance levels in terms of ROE and rel-
ative TSR, as well as threshold levels required in terms of
Return on Risk Capital.

The LTI plans 2016 and 2017, currently in progress, may
result in shares’ granting respectively in 2019 and 2020,
subject to the Group performance level (determined by
the comparison of ranges of ROE and relative TSR) and
the overcoming of the minimum level, where requested,
in terms of Economic Solvency ratio.

As far as the lock-up constraint, 50% of the shares are
immediately available, the remaining 50% is subject toa
two year lock-up period.

Further details are given in the information reports ap-
proved at the time by the Shareholders’ Meeting and
published on the Generali Group website, as well as in
the Remuneration Report annually published.

With a structure similar to the last year, a new long-term
incentive plan based on Assicurazioni Generali shares —
Group Long Term Incentive (LTI) 2018 - has been submit-
ted for the approval of the Shareholders’ Meeting.

In line with market practices and investor expectations,
shares are assigned and available to beneficiaries over a
total time frame of 6 years, subject to the achievement of
Group’s performance conditions (Return on Equity - ROE
- and relative Total Shareholders Return - rTSR) and the
achievement of a minimum level of Regulatory Solvency
Ratio, as detailed below.

The Plan is based on the following key aspects:

- the incentive connected with the achievement of the
targets is paid through the grant of Assicurazioni Gen-
erali S.p.A. ordinary shares;

- the right to receive the shares is subject to an entry
threshold, defined annually by the Board of Directors
and which represents a condition precedent;

— the targets to which payment of the incentive is subject
are Group financial ones and are defined at the begin-
ning of the three-year performance period.

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

In detail, the maximum number of shares that can be as-
signed is determined at the start of the plan. The maxi-
mum potential bonus to be disbursed in shares equals to
175% of the gross fixed remuneration of the plan partic-
ipants (or a different percentage considered the role of
the related beneficiaries); therefore, the maximum num-
ber of shares that can be assigned is the result of the
ratio of the maximum bonus and the share value, with
the latter calculated as the average price of the share
in the three months prior to the meeting of the Board of
Directors called to resolve on the draft statutory financial
statements of the Holding Company and the consolidat-
ed financial statements for the year previous to the year
of Plan start.

The maximum number of shares that can potentially be
assigned to participants at the end of the three years is
divided up into three tranches; the first tranche is for 30%
of the maximum number of shares to be possibly as-
signed, the second is for a further 30% and the remain-
ing 40% represents the third tranche, each tranche being
subject to certain specific targets as described below.

Once the level of the Regulatory Solvency ratio has been
reached, the achievement of the Group’s financial targets,
represented by the ROE and the relative TSR, compared
with the peers part of the STOXX Euro Insurance index,
is verified on a yearly and overall three-year cycle basis.

The performance level, expressed as a percentage, is
determined by a calculation methodology, based on two
independent baskets respectively for the achievement of
the ROE and the relative TSR. The final results in each bas-
ket, with a 50% weight on the bonus assignable, shall be
calculated using a linear interpolation approach. The max-
imum performance level is 175% overall (or a different per-
centage considered the role of the related beneficiaries).

During each year of the plan and at the end of the three
years, the Board of Directors evaluates the degree to
which the Regulatory Solvency Ratio has been achieved
as compared with the limit set as 120%, or alternative
percentage as may be chosen from time to time by the
Board of Directors. On the basis of this evaluation, the
number of shares to be accrued annually or definitively
granted may be reduced or even zeroed by the Board
of Directors if the Regulatory Solvency Ratio should fall
below the threshold established.

In any case, no incentive will be paid in the event of a
significant worsening of the capital and financial situation
of the Company. Any amount disbursed will be subject to
claw-back if the performance considered should later be
