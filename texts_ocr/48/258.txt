— Held to maturity investments

The category includes primarily bonds, which valuation is
above described. If the fair value cannot be reliably de-
termined, the amortized cost is used as the best estimate
for the determination of fair value.

- Loans

The category includes bonds, which valuation is de-
scribed above, mortgages and other loans .

In particular, mortgages and other loans are valued on
the basis of future payments of principal and interest dis-
counted at the interest rates for similar investments by
incorporating the expected future losses or alternative-
ly discounting (with risk-free rate) to the probable future
cash flows considering market or entity-specific data
(i.e. probability of default). These assets are classified as
level 2 or 3 depending on whether or not the inputs are
corroborated by market data.

If the fair value cannot be reliably determined, the amor-
tized cost is used as the best estimate for the determina-
tion of fair value.

— Receivables from banks or customers

Considering their nature, the amortized cost is generally
considered a good approximation of fair value and there-
fore classified within level 3. If appropriate, they are val-
ued at market value, considering observable inputs, and
therefore classified within level 2.

— Land and buildings (investment and self-used proper-
ties)

These assets are mainly valuated on the basis of inputs
of similar assets in active markets or of discounted cash
flows of future income and expenses of the rental con-
sidered as part of the higher and best use by a market

participant. Based on the analysis of inputs used for val-
uation, considering the limited cases where the inputs
would be observable in active markets, the Group pro-
ceeded to classify the whole category at level 3.

In particular, the valuation takes into consideration not
only the discounted net future income but also the pecu-
liarities of the properties such as intended use and loca-
tion as well as the entity of the vacancy rate.

The fair value of land and buildings (investment prop-
erties) is mainly based on external appraisals based on
methods described above.

- Investments in subsidiaries, associated companies
and joint ventures

The carrying amount, based on the share of equity for
associates and interests in joint ventures or on cost ad-
justed for eventual impairment losses for non-consolidat-
ed subsidiaries, is used as a reasonable estimate of the
related fair value and, therefore, these investments are
classified in level 3.

— Subordinated debts, loans and bonds and liabilities to
banks and customers

Generally, if available and if the market is defined as ac-
tive, fair value is equal to the market price.

The fair value is determined primarily on the basis of the
income approach using discounting techniques. In par-
ticular, the fair value of debt instruments issued by the
Group are valued using discounted cash flow models
based on the current marginal rates of the Group financ-
ing for similar types of instruments, with maturities con-
sistent with the residual maturity of the debt instruments
subject to valuation.

If measured at amortized cost as an approximation of fair
value, they are classified in Level 3.
