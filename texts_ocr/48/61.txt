| 60 | Generali Group Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

During the year, the Group retained its positioning on the market in the product inno-
vation area and in customer services thanks to the Smart Insurance programme, with
the Generali Vitality programme extended to all of the distribution networks, the offer
of products in telematics (Generali Mobility), domotics (Generali Domocity), and legal
protection, and also thanks to digitalisation in health services and claims.

Generali also successfully launched many initiatives in different cities as part of The
Human Safety Net programme, which was also presented to the Office of the President
of the German Republic during Berlin’s Burgerfest held in September. The programme
supports refugees and their start-ups by providing co-working space, training courses
and access to a wide range of trade contacts.

As regards the financial markets, the yield of the ten-year German Bund closed the year
at 0.2% (0.4 in 2017). The DAX stock market lost 18% due to the economic data coming
in below expectations in the Eurozone, concerns surrounding the tax policy of the Italian
government and the Brexit negotiations.

In line with the Group's strategic initiatives, Life premiums show a growth in protection
products (+5.8%, supported by the increase in single premium policies), as well as unit-
linked policies (+5.6%, thanks mainly to regular premium policies), only partly offset by
the decline in savings products with regular premiums (-5.8%).

The new production in terms of PVNBP shows a reduction of 5.6% attributable to the
decline in the Life segment (-6.9%), affected mainly by the process to restructure the
sales networks; the protection sector, however, grew by 14.9%. Specifically, there was
a contraction in savings products (-10.6%), protection products (-6.3%) and unit-linked
products (-3.0%).

New business profitability (expressed as a percentage of the PVNBP) is equal to 2.83%,
stable compared to 2.85% in 2017, due to the recalibration of the guarantees offered
and the maintenance of a good business mix in spite of the decline in business. New
business value amounted to € 228 million (-6.2%).

The P&C segment volumes are driven by the positive performance of the non-motor
segment (+1.8%), which benefits from the increase in policies mainly in the home and
commercial lines, in particular supported by the Global Corporate & Commercial lines.
The motor segment was slightly positive (+0.1%), in spite of the drop in third-party lia-
bility lines (-1.4%) following the pruning of the portfolio.

The combined ratio shows a slight worsening compared to the previous fiscal year
(+0.2 pps), attributable to the increase in the loss ratio following higher impacts from
catastrophes (+1.0 pps) registered in Germany, a lower contribution from prior year loss
ratio, all partly mitigated by the positive trend of contributions from the current year
loss ratio.
