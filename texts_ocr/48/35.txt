There is no stock ownership system for employees and there are no shareholder agreements on shares. It should,
however, be noted that the Company facilitates participation in Shareholders’ Meetings for beneficiaries of long term
incentive (LTI) plans - which are based on Generali shares - by providing them with a designated representative.

The Company maintains continuing relations with all external stakeholders: institutional investors, proxy advisors,
financial analysts and retail shareholders. Its intense relationship activities consist of various types of interaction with
individual stakeholders or groups, as part of roadshows and sector conferences, as well as ad hoc occasions for the
discussion of specific topics, ranging from business, financial and performance matters to corporate governance,
remuneration and sustainability topics relevant to the various financial community representatives. Some of the main
recurring occasions for interaction with the Company’s top management are the annual Shareholders’ Meeting and
the Investor Day.
