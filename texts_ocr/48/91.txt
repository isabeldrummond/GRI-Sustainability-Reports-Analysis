Holding and other businesses segment

The Holding and other businesses segment includes the
activities of the Group companies in the banking and as-
set management sectors, the costs incurred for the direc-

tion, coordination and financing activities, as well as all
other operations that the Group considers to be ancillary
to the core insurance business.

The operating result of the aforementioned business sectors are summarized in the table below:

 

 

 

(€ million) 31/12/2018 31/12/2017 Change
Holding and other businesses operating result -70 -163 -57.1%
Financial and other businesses 397 291 36.3%
Holding operating expenses -467 -454 2.9%

The operating result of the Holding and other businesses
segment came to € -70 million, an improvement com-
pared to € -163 million at 31 December 2017.

In particular, the operating result of the financial and other
businesses posted an increase, to € 397 million (€ 291
million at 31 December 2017). The 36.3% increase re-
flected mainly the performance, particularly in the last

quarter, recorded in Lion River and Planvital. The result of
Banca Generali was slightly lower at € 233 million (-3.6%).
Net holding operating expenses amounted to € -467 mil-
lion (€ -454 million at 31 December 2017), reflecting high-
er costs for the disposal in Germany and the execution
of the new asset management strategy, as well as lower
revenues from brand fees.
