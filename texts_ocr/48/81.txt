Performance of the Property & Casualty segment

Premiums development

The gross written premiums in the Property & Casualty
(P&C) segment continued the growth observed during
the year, standing at € 20,607 million, growing by 3.3%,
thanks to the positive performance of both business lines.
The increase in the motor line (+3.4%) was supported by
the growth observed in ACEER (+5.7%), which reflect-
ed the positive trend in the Czech Republic for pricing
policies and the development of partnerships in fleets
and leasing, the increase in car sales in Hungary and
the growth observed in Austria. France also increased
(+4.2%), partly as a result of new distribution partner-
ships, and Americas and Southern Europe (+19.2%),
mainly due to the pricing adjustments made in Argentina
following inflation. In spite of recovering in the second
half of the year, motor premium income in Italy was down
by 1.7%, following the measures adopted to recover the
portfolio profitability

Non-motor premiums also rose by 2.7%, thanks to the
positive trends broadly extended across the Group’s var-

ious areas of operations. Premium income in ACEER in-
creased (+4.1%), led by Poland (+16.4% deriving from
the corporate business and by the development of travel
products), Hungary (+7.7% which mostly benefits from
growth in home products and in the health business vol-
umes), Austria (+1.9% driven by the accident & health
business) and Croatia (+51% thanks to the business
underwritten through Unicredit). Performance was pos-
itive in France (+2.7%) thanks to the performance of
the accident & health line, Germany (+1.8%) due to the
growth in Global Corporate & Commercial lines, as well
as in the home and commercial lines, and International
cluster (+7.2%), driven by Europ Assistance thanks to
the development of travel insurance and roadside assis-
tance in mature markets. The decrease observed in Italy
(-1.5%) was mainly related to the reduction of the Global
Corporate & Commercial lines as well as the health busi-
ness which were affected by heavy competition in a mar-
ket characterized by sustained price competition.
