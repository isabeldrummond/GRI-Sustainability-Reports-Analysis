9.2. Activities of the Board of Statutory
Auditors in view of the conferment of the
appointment of the statutory audit of the
accounts for the nine-year period 2021-
2029

In March 2018, the Board of Statutory Auditors, in its
capacity as the Internal Control and Audit Commit-
tee, together with the Group CFO structure and the
other competent corporate functions, started the se-
lection procedure aimed at identifying the new audit-
ing company to be appointed for the nine-year period
2021-2029. The decision to undertake this procedure
before the expiry of the EY mandate (2020) was first
and foremost dictated by the need to ensure compli-
ance with the independent auditor’s forecasts pursuant
to EU Regulation no. 537/2014, to which the Company
is subject by virtue of its status as a “public interest
entity” (PIE).

Art. 5 of EU Regulation n. 537/2014 identifies specific
services that the auditor and entities belonging to the
relevant network cannot provide to the institution of in-
terest and to the companies controlled by it also in the
year immediately preceding the first object of the audit
assignment (“cooling-in period”) (in the case of Generali,
in 2020).

Secondly, the appointment of the new auditor prior to
the expiry of the one in office facilitates handover from
the outgoing to the incoming auditor. This would allow
for dealing more efficaciously with the lesser knowl-
edge about the PIE and its group the incoming auditor
would inevitably have more knowledge of the PIE and
the group, in the hopes of obtaining a better quality of
statutory audit.

In compliance with the provisions of Art. 16 of EU Regu-
lation n. 537/2014, the procedure for selecting the new
auditor was carried out in a fully transparent and trace-
able manner, and was conducted on the basis of clear
and non-discriminatory assessment criteria.

The subject of the selection procedure also included
auditing the financial statements of Italian and foreign
companies subject to the control of the Company pur-
suant to Art. 93 of the TUIF, including other PIEs. The
BSA agreed with the Company, as well as with the con-
trol bodies of subsidiaries, that the assignment of the
audit assignment concerning the accounts of the entire
Group to a single subject allows for greater efficiency
and quality in the performance of the audit. The single
auditor approach also satisfies the requirement of en-
suring greater uniformity in application of the rules on
the issue of the independence of the auditor are not
only for PIEs, but also to their parent and subsidiary
companies.

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

In compliance with applicable legislation, auditing com-
panies having the competence and experience in the
statutory audit of issuers with listed shares, as well as
knowledge and structures suitable for carrying out the
audit engagement in a group international operating in
the insurance sector were invited to take part in the se-
lection procedure.

The Board of Statutory Auditors examined in detail the
proposals received from the candidate companies and
met their respective representatives, all with the support
of specialised external consultants and competent cor-
porate structures.

During individual stages of the selection process, the
BSA held discussions with the internal control and au-
diting committees of subsidiaries which can be qualified
as PIEs so as to organise the evaluation task, to define
its methodologies and timing and to share the results.
Maintaining that flow of information has enabled the BSA
to coordinate the selection process of just one auditor
of the group, although each subsidiary is responsible for
making its decision.

At the end of the tender, in the meeting of 4 March 2019,
the Board of Statutory Auditors approved the recom-
mendation requested pursuant to Art. 16, par. 2, of EU
Regulation no. 537/2014, which was made available to
the Company’s Shareholders in view of the Shareholders’
Meeting for the approval of the financial statements as at
31 December 2018, as called to resolve on the assign-
ment of the audit appointment.

As part of the Recommendation, in compliance with the
provisions of Art. 16 of EU Regulation n. 537/2014, the
Board of Statutory Auditors indicated two potential al-
ternatives for appointment and expressed its duly justi-
fied preference for one of the two candidates. The Rec-
ommendation also contains a detailed illustration of the
phases in which the selective procedure was articulated,
the selection criteria that were applied and the results
of the assessments performed by the Board of Statutory
Auditors.
