Asset Management segment

The Asset Management segment includes the activities
exercised by asset management companies operating
within the Group.

This segment operates as a provider of products and ser-
vices both to the insurance companies of the Generali
Group and to third-party clients. The products include
equity and fixed-income funds, as well as alternative
products. The aim pursued by Asset Management is to
identify investment opportunities and sources of growth
for all of its clients, while managing risks.

The segment includes companies specialised in institu-
tional and retail clients, rather than in Group insurance
companies or third-party clients, or in products such as
real assets, high conviction strategies or more traditional
investments.

Its scope includes, for example, companies in the Gen-
erali Investments group, Generali Real Estate, Generali
Investments CEE and Fortuna Investments, to which are
added the other companies linked to the multi-boutique
strategy and some companies operating in Asia.

The operating result of Asset Management increased from
€ 261 million in 2017 to € 335 million in 2018 (+28.2%).
This increase was mainly due to the increase in the op-
erating result of the Generali Investments group, made
possible following the renegotiation of commissions on
the insurance mandates of Group companies and the

larger volumes on real assets, which also resulted in the
increase in non-recurring commissions.

A proper cost-containment policy, together with business
development aimed at increasing Assets under Manage-
ment and consequently revenues, led to the positive re-
sults described above.
