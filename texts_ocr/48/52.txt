(*) Net of depreciation of the period.

The current return on investments fell slightly, reaching
3.0% (3.1% at 31 December 2017). The performance of
this indicator is attributable, on the one hand, to the in-
crease in average investments and, on the other, to a fall
in the absolute value of current income, which amount-
ed to € 10,668 million (€ 10,847 million at 31 December
2017), due to the low interest rates obtainable as part of
the reinvestment activity.

The contribution to the result of the period deriving from
net realized gains, net impairment losses and net unreal-
ized gains (harvesting rate)®° showed a decrease, reach-
ing -0.1% (0.6% at 31 December 2017), following both a
greater impact of the impairment losses, particularly sig-
nificant compared to those posted in the previous period,
and a lower impact of the net realized gains.

The contribution to investments backing unit-linked contracts was excluded. Please refer to the Methodological note on alternative performance measures for details on the

calculation of the Return on investments.
