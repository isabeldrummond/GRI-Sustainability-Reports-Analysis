About the
Annual Integrated Report

This Report provides an integrated overview of the Group’s sustainable value
creation process, reporting current and outlook material financial and non-
financial information, as well as highlighting the connections between the
context in which we carry on our business, strategy, corporate governance
structure and remuneration policy.

The Report is drafted in compliance with currently effective regulations,
including leg. decree 254/2016 concerning the disclosure of non-financial
information relating to environmental matters, social and employee-related
matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters. This
information is clearly identified through a specific infographic (NFS) created
for the purposes of simplifying the fulfilments required by the decree and
improving accessibility to the information itself.

The criteria of the International <IR> Framework issued by the International
Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) are also applied to the Report. The
standard adopted for the disclosure of the matters identified by the Group,
including those non-financial matters envisaged by leg. decree 254/2016, is
the Consolidated Set of GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, issued in
2016 by the GRI-Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-Referenced claims), with
reference to selected GRI Standards and indicators of the GRI G4 Financial
Services Sector Disclosures.
