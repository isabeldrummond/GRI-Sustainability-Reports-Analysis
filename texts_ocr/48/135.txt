Methodological note on alternative performance

Measures

In order to help the assessment of the quality and sus-
tainability of the net result of the Generali Group in the
various business segments and territorial areas, the
Management Report includes the following alternative
performance measures.

Operating result

Under CESR Recommendations on alternative perfor-
mance measures (CESR/05 - 178b), the operating result
cannot replace earnings before taxes calculated in ac-
cordance with IAS/IFRS. In addition, it should be read
with the financial information and related notes on the ac-
counts which are included in the audited financial state-
ments.

The operating result was drawn up by reclassifying items
of earnings before taxes for each segment on the basis
of the management characteristics of each segment and
taking into consideration the recurring holding expenses.
Specifically, the operating result represents earnings be-
fore taxes, gross of interest expense on liabilities linked to
financing activities, specific net income from investments
and non-recurring income and expenses.

Starting from this report, the Group has reviewed the por-
trayal of its operating segments through the introduction
of a new Asset Management segment, to provide a dis-
closure more closely aligned with the new Group organi-
zational structure, in addition to ensure an improved eco-
nomic representation of the performance of the individual
business and geographical segments.

In the Life segment, all profit and loss accounts are con-
sidered as operating items, except for the following which
are represented in the non-operating result:

— net realized gains and net impairment losses on in-
vestments that do not affect the formation of the local
technical reserves, but only the calculation of the de-
ferred liabilities towards policyholders for the amount
not attributable to the policyholders, and on those of
the free assets;

— net other non-operating expenses that mainly include
the results of the run-off activities, company restruc-
turing charges, depreciation of the value of the portfo-
lios acquired directly or through acquisition of control
of insurance companies (value of business acquired or
VOBA) and other net non-recurring expenses. In par-
ticular, with respect to the calculation method of the
policyholders’ profit sharing based on the net result

of the period, the life non-operating result in Germany
and Austria was entirely calculated net of the estimated
amount attributable to the policyholders. Furthermore,
where a new fiscal law materially affects the operating
result of the countries where the policyholders’ profit
sharing is based on the net result of the period, the
estimated non-recurring effect on the income taxes at-
tributable to the policyholders has been accounted for
in the operating result.

In the Property & Casualty segment, all profit and loss
accounts are considered as operating items, except for
the following which are represented in the non-operating
result:

- realized gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses,
net impairment losses on investments, including gains
and losses on foreign currencies;

— net other non-operating expenses, principally including
the results of real estate development activities, run-off
activities, the impairment losses on property held for
own use, company restructuring charges and amorti-
zation of the value of the portfolios acquired directly or
through the acquisition of control of insurance compa-
nies (value of business acquired or VOBA) and other
net non-recurring expenses.

In the Asset Management segment, all profit and loss

accounts are considered as operating items, except for

the following which are represented in the non-operating

result:

— net other non-operating expenses, principally including
project costs, including consulting, and severances.

The Holding and other businesses segment includes the
activities in the banking and asset management sec- tors,
the costs incurred for the direction, coordination and fi-
nancing activities, as well as all the other operations that
the Group considers to be ancillary to the core insurance
business.

All profit and loss accounts are considered as operating

items, except for the following which are represented in

the non-operating result:

— non-recurring realized gains and losses and net impair-
ment losses;

— net other non-operating expenses that mainly include
the results of the run-off activities, company restructur-
ing charges, depreciation of the value of the portfolios
acquired directly or through acquisition of control of
companies operating in the banking and asset man-
agement sectors (value of business acquired or VOBA)
and other net non-recurring expenses.
