The most important strategy for the mitigation of cred-
it risk used by the Group is the application of a liabili-
ty-driven SAA, which can limit the impact of the market
spread volatility. In addition, the Group is actively mitigat-
ing counterparty default risk by using a collateralisation
strategy that strongly alleviates the losses that the Group
might suffer as a result of the default of one or more of its
counterparties.

Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate
or failed internal processes, personnel or systems, or
from external events. The definition includes the compli-
ance risk and financial reporting risk and excludes the
strategic and reputational risks.

Although ultimate responsibility for managing the risk
sits in the first line, the so-called risk owners, the Risk
Management Function with its methodologies and pro-
cesses ensures an early identification of the most se-
vere threats across the Group. In doing so, it provides
management at all levels with a holistic view of the broad
operational risk spectrum that is essential for prioritizing
actions and allocating resources in most risk related crit-
ical areas.

The target is achieved by adopting methodologies and
tools in line with industry best practices and by establish-
ing a strong dialogue with the first line of defence.

Furthermore, since 2015, the Group has been exchang-
ing operational risk data, properly anonymized, through
the “Operational Risk data eXchange Association (ORX)”,
a global association of operational risk practitioners
where main industry players also participate. The aim
is to use the data to improve the risk management and
to anticipate emerging trends. In addition, since losses
are collected by the first line, the process contributes to
create awareness among the risk owners upon risks that
actually impact the Group. In this sense, a primary role is
played by Group-wide forward-looking assessments that
aim to estimate the evolution of the operational risk expo-
sure in a given time horizon, supporting in the anticipation
of potential threats, in the efficient allocation of resources
and related initiatives.

Based on the last assessments, the most relevant sce-
narios at Group level are related to cyber-attacks and
non-compliance risks, with respect to sectorial regulatory
developments.

To further strengthen the risk management system and
in addition to the usual risk owners’ responsibilities, the
Group established specialised units within the first line of
defence with the scope of dealing with specific threats
(e.g. cyber risk, fraud, financial reporting risk) and that act
as a key partner for the Risk Management Function.

Another benefit from this cooperation is constituted by a
series of risk management measures triggered across the
Group as a result of control testing, assessments and the
collection of operational risk events.

An example is the creation of a dedicated unit for the man-
agement and coordination of the Group-wide IT Security
that steers the evolution of the IT security strategy and
operating model, ensuring a timely detection and fixing
of the vulnerabilities that may affect the business. This
initiative helps the Group to better cope with the growing
threat represented by cyber risk.

The SCR for operational risk amounts to € 2,216 million
before diversification (equal to 7% of total SCR before
diversification). The SCR for operational risk is calculated
based on standard formula.

Other Material Risks
Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the uncertainty, emanating
from business operations, investment or financing activi-
ties, over the ability of the Group and its Legal Entities to
meet payment obligations in a full and timely manner, ina
current or stressed environment.

The Group is exposed to liquidity risk from its insurance
operating activity, due to the potential mismatches be-
tween the cash inflows and the cash outflows deriving
from the business.

Liquidity risk can also stem from investing activity, due to
potential liquidity gaps deriving from the management of
the asset portfolio as well as from a potentially insufficient
level of liquidity in case of disposals (e.g. capacity to sell
adequate amounts at a fair price and within a reasonable
timeframe).

Liquidity risk from financing activity is related to the po-
tential difficulties in accessing the primary market of debt
or in paying excessive financing costs.
