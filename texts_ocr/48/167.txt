Other tangible assets

Property, plant, equipment, furniture and property inven-
tories are classified in this item as property inventory.
They are initially measured at cost and subsequently rec-
ognised net of any accumulated depreciation and impair-
ment losses. They are systematically depreciated on the
basis of economic/technical rates determined in accord-
ance with their residual value over their useful economic
life. In particular the inventories are measured at the low-
er of cost (including cost of purchase, cost of conversion
and cost incurred the inventories to their present location
and condition) and net realizable value, i.e. the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less the
estimated cost of completion and costs to sell.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any signif-
icant part initially recognised is de-recognised upon dis-
posal or when no future economic benefits are expect-
ed from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on
de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
amount of the asset) is included in the income statement
when the asset is de-recognised.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depre-
ciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at
each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if ap-
propriate.

Reinsurance provisions

The item comprises amounts ceded to reinsurers from in-
surance provisions that fall under IFRS 4 scope. They are
accounted for in accordance with the accounting princi-
ples applied to direct insurance contracts.

Investments

Land and Buildings (Investment
Properties)

In accordance with IAS 40, this item includes land and
buildings held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation
or both. Land and buildings for own activities and prop-
erty inventories are instead classified as tangible assets.
Furthermore, assets for which the sale is expected to be
completed within one year are classified as non-current
assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale.

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

To measure the value of land and buildings (investment
properties), the Generali Group applies the cost model
set out by IAS 40, and adopts the depreciation criteria
defined by IAS 16. Please refer to the paragraph on land
and buildings (self-used) for information about criteria
used by the Group and finance leases of land and build-
ings.

Investments in subsidiaries, associated
companies and joint ventures

This item includes investments in subsidiaries and asso-
ciated companies valued at equity or at cost. Immaterial
investments in subsidiaries and associated companies,
as well as investments in associated companies and in-
terests in joint ventures valued using the equity method
belong to this category.

A list of such investments is shown in attachment to this
Consolidated financial statement.

Financial investments — classification and
measurement

Financial Instruments included in scope of IAS 39 are
classified as follows:

- Held to maturity

— Loans and receivables

— Available for sale financial assets

- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

The classification depends on the nature and purpose of
holding financial instruments and is determined at initial
recognition except for allowed reclassifications in rare
circumstances and when the purpose of holding the fi-
nancial assets changes.

The financial investments are initially recognized at fair
value plus, in the case of instruments not measured at
fair value through profit or loss, the directly attributable
transactions costs.

Non-derivative financial assets with fixed and determina-
ble payments, those that the entity has the intention and
the ability to hold to maturity, unquoted and not available
for sale are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
