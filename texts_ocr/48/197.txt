2.4 Unconsolidated Structured Entites

As of 31 December 2018, Generali Group holds no in-
terests in unconsolidated structured entities that expose
the Group to the variability of returns arising from their
performance.

However, please find below the following cases:

- In 2016 Generali Group stipulated a contract with
Horse Capital |, an Irish designated activity compa-
ny, to protect the aggregate motor third party liabili-
ty (MTPL) loss ratio of 12 of its subsidiaries that write
business in the 7 European countries in which Generali
has a relevant market share in motor business (Italy,
Germany, France, Austria, Czeck Republic, Spain and
Switzerland)

- Generali Group is considered a sponsor because it
originated the insurance risk of the structured entity.
The Group transfers,by this protection, part of the risk

linked to unexpected fluctuations of the MTPL loss
ratio. Generali pays a different premium every year
depending on the subscribed tranche - being 4% on
Class A, 6,25% on Class B and 12% on Class C - on
the amount of cover provided corresponding to each
tranche amounting to € 85 million. The related cost is
presented within “The Earned premiums cede” line in
the statement of Profit or loss.

— In 2017 Assicurazioni Generali stipulated a reinsurance
contract in the current year with Lion Il Re DAC, an
lrish special purpose company, which for a period of
four years will cover the possible catastrophic losses
suffered by the Generali Group following storms and
floods in Europe and earthquakes in Italy. The Lion Il
Re transaction transfers part of the risk to bond inves-
tors, thus optimizing the Group’s protection against
disasters. The positive outcome of the placement of
ILS debt securities on the capital market has made it
possible to guarantee the protection provided by Lion
Il Re DAC to Generali with an annual premium of 3%
for a total of € 200 million of reinsurance coverage. This
amount will be returned by Lion II Re DAC to investors
if during the 4 years of operation of the transaction no
events occurred on the Generali Group, deriving re-
spectively from storms or floods in Europe or earth-
quake in Italy, in excess of pre-established damage
thresholds each type of risk.

The aforementioned vehicles are not consolidated as the
Generali Group has no control over the entities and is not
exposed to the resulting variable returns.
