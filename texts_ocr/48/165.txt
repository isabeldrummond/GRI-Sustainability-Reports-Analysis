Balance Sheet — Assets
Intangible assets

In accordance with IAS 38, an intangible asset is recog-
nised if, and only if, it is identifiable and controllable and
it is probable that the expected future economic benefits
attributable to the asset will flow to the company and the
cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

This category includes goodwill and other intangible as-
sets, such as goodwill recognised in the separate finan-
cial statements of the consolidated companies, software
and purchased insurance portfolio.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the sum of future benefits not separate-
ly identifiable in a business combination. At the date of
acquisition, the goodwill is equal to the excess between
the sum of the consideration transferred, including con-
tingent consideration, liabilities assumed towards the
previous owners the fair value of non-controlling interests
as well as, in a business combination achieved in stag-
es, the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity
interest in the acquiree and the fair value (present value)
of net amount of the separately identifiable assets and
liabilities acquired.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less
any impairment losses and it is no longer amortised. Ac-
cording to IAS 36, goodwill is not subject to amortization.
Realized gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries
include the related goodwill. Goodwill is tested at least
annually in order to identify any impairment losses.

The purpose of the impairment test on goodwill is to
identify the existence of any impairment losses on the
carrying amount recognised as intangible asset. In this
context, cash-generating units to which the goodwill
is allocated are identified and tested for impairment.
Cash-generating units (CGU) units usually represent the
consolidated units within the same primary segment in
each country. Any impairment is equal to the difference,
if negative, between the carrying amount and the recov-
erable amount, which is the higher between the fair value
of the cash-generating unit and its value in use, i.e. the

present value of the future cash flows expected to be de-
rived from the cash-generating units. The fair value of the
CGU is determined on the basis of current market quota-
tion or usually adopted valuation techniques (mainly DDM
or alternatively Market Value Balance Sheet or appraisal
value). The Dividend Discount Model is a variant of the
Cash flow method. In particular the Dividend Discount
Model, in the excess capital methodology, states that the
economic value of an entity is equal to the discounted
dividends flow calculated considering the minimum cap-
ital requirements. Such models are based on projections
on budgets/forecasts approved by management or con-
servative or prudential assumptions covering a maximum
period of five years. Cash flow projections for a period
longer than five years are extrapolated using estimated
among others growth rates. The discount rates reflect the
free risk rate, adjusted to take into account specific risks.
Should any previous impairment losses no longer exist,
they cannot be reversed.

For further details see paragraph “Information on consol-
idation perimeter and Group companies” in the Notes.

Other intangible assets

Intangible assets with finite useful life are measured at
acquisition or production cost less any accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses. The amortisation
is based on the useful life and begins when the asset
is available for use. Specifically, the purchased software
expenses are capitalised on the basis of the cost for pur-
chase and usage.

The costs related to their development and maintenance
are charged to the profit and loss account of the period
in which they are incurred.

Other intangible assets with indefinite useful life are not
subject to amortization. They are periodically tested for
impairment.

Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangi-
ble asset are measured as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset
and are recognised in the income statement when the
asset is de-recognised.
