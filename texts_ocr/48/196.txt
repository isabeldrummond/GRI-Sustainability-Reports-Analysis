As part of the commercial relationships in the German
area with the distribution partner DVAG, we inform that
the current controlling shareholder hold a put option ex-
ercisable in respect of Generali Group.

At the reporting date no liability has been accounted for
because the put option refers to an associate and there-
fore it does not fall into the category of the options on
non-controlling interests referred to in par. 23 of IAS 32.

The potential outflow of resources will be defined by the
parties when and if the option is exercised on the basis
of the fair value measurement criteria of the option itself.

Furthermore, the Group holds interests in associates
which are not individually material that, as mentioned
above, are accounted for according to the equity meth-
od. The associates in which the Group has interest mainly
operate in the insurance and financial services industries.
