in line with the derecognition of the equalisation and ca-
tastrophe provisions and some additional components
of the unearned premiums provisions, carried out on the
date of the first-time application.

The provisions for unearned premiums includes the
pro-rata temporis provision, which is the amount of gross
premiums written allocated to the following financial peri-
ods, and the provision for unexpired risks, which provides
for claims and expenses in excess of the related unearned
premiums.

The provisions for outstanding claims are determined by
a prudent assessment of damages, based on objective
and prospective considerations of all predictable charges.

Provisions are deemed adequate to cover payments of
damages and the cost of settlement of claims related to
accident occurred during the year but not yet reported.

The non-life insurance provisions meets the requirements
of the liability adequacy test according to IFRS 4.

Amounts ceded to reinsurers from insurance provisions
are determined in accordance with the criteria applied for
the direct insurance and accepted reinsurance.

Other financial liabilities

The item includes financial liabilities within the scope of
IAS 39 that are not classified as at fair value through prof-
it or loss and are instead measured at amortised cost.

This item comprises both subordinated liabilities, which,
in the case of bankruptcy, are to be repaid only after the
claims of all other creditors have been met, and hybrid
instruments.

Bond instruments issued are measured at issue price, net
of costs directly attributed to the transaction. The differ-
ence between the aforesaid price and the reimbursement
price is recognised along the duration of the issuance in
the profit and loss account using the effective interest
rate method.

Furthermore, it includes liabilities to banks or customers,
deposits received from reinsurers, bonds issued, other
loans and financial liabilities at amortised cost related to
investment contracts that do not fall under IFRS 4 scope.

Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation
under the liability is discharged or cancelled, or expires.

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or
the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi-
fied, such an exchange or modification is treated as the
derecognition of the original liability and the recognition
of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying
amounts is recognised in the income statement.
