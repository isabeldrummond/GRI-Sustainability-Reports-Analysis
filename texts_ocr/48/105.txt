2. Group PIM Governance

Governance and processes regarding the Group PIM are

defined in the Group Internal Model Governance Policy,

ensuring that:

— models and components are appropriate for their pur-
pose;

— procedures are in place to design, implement, use and
validate new models and model changes;

— the appropriateness of models on an ongoing basis is
verified.

To rule the activities related to the Internal Model devel-
opments necessary to ensure its appropriateness over
time and, more in general, to support the Internal Model
change process, the Group Internal Model Change Policy
has been also defined with the aim to specify roles and
responsibilities in the implementation of major and minor
changes.

A dedicated committee, the Internal Model Committee,
has been established to approve Group PIM calibrations,
to support the Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO) in the
decision-making process on Group PIM developments
or model changes and to control the full model lifecy-
cle, assuring proper compliance with the Group Internal
Model Governance Policy. This Committee is chaired by
the Model Design Authority, responsible for ensuring the
overall consistency and reliability of the Group PIM.

The GCRO defines the processes and controls to ensure
the ongoing appropriateness of the design and oper-
ations of the Group PIM, so that it continues to appro-
priately reflect the Group risk profile. The GCRO is also
responsible for defining the methodology of each mod-
el component, on the basis of the Group Internal Model
Committee’s proposals, as well as for the results produc-
tion and ultimately for submitting the relevant Internal
Model supporting documentation to the AMSB.

The AMSB, assisted by the Risk and Control Committee,
ensures the ongoing appropriateness of the design and
operations, the ongoing compliance of the Group PIM
and also that the Group PIM continues to appropriately
reflect the risk profile of the Group.

These roles are generally mirrored within the organization-
al structure of each Group Legal Entity within PIM scope.

No material changes have occurred during the period
with reference to the PIM governance.

3. Group PIM Validation

The Group PIM is subject to independent validation on
an ongoing basis, which aims to gain assurance of the
completeness, robustness and reliability of the processes
and results of the Group PIM as well as their compliance
with the Solvency II regulatory requirements.

The validation process follows the principles and proce-
dures defined within the Group Internal Model Validation
Policy and related guidelines.

In particular, the validation outputs are designed to sup-
port Senior Management and AMSB in understanding
the appropriateness of the Group PIM, including areas
of weaknesses and limitations, especially with regards to
its use.

To ensure an adequate level of independence, the re-
sources performing the validation activities are not in-
volved in the development and operation of the Group
PIM.

Within the validation process also results obtained dur-
ing previous validation cycles are taken into account, as
well as developments within internal and external busi-
ness environment, financial market trends and Group PIM
changes. The Internal Model validation process excludes
those aspects covered by the assurance work of the
Actuarial Function (i.e. technical provisions and related IT
systems, actuarial platforms and their governance).

Furthermore, the validation procedures also serve as an
incentive mechanism to ensure timely and accurate in-
corporation of modelling refinements.

In order to warrant the appropriateness of the array of
elements contained within the Group PIM, the validation
covers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of
the Internal Model, and is therefore not limited to the cal-
culation engine and methodology. Other important items
such as data quality, documentation and uses of the
Model are validated accordingly.

The validation process is carried out on regular annu-
al basis and when requested by the AMSB or Senior
Management (e.g. in case of PIM changes).
