Valuation techniques

Valuation techniques are used when a quoted price is
not available or shall be appropriate in the circumstances
and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair
value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs
and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

Single or multiple valuation techniques valuation tech-
nique will be appropriate. If multiple valuation techniques
are used to measure fair value, the results shall be evalu-
ated considering the reasonableness of the range of val-
ues indicated by those results. A fair value measurement
is the point within that range that is most representative
of fair value in the circumstances.

Three widely used valuation techniques are:

— market approach: uses prices and other relevant in-
formation generated by market transactions involving
identical or comparable (i.e. similar) assets, liabilities or
a group of assets and liabilities;

— cost approach: reflects the amount that would be re-
quired currently to replace the service capacity of an
asset; and

— income approach: converts future amounts to a single
current (i.e. discounted) amount.

Application to assets and liabilities
— Debt securities

Generally, if available and if the market is defined as ac-
tive, fair value is equal to the market price.

In the opposite case, the fair value is determined using
the market and income approach. Primary inputs to the
market approach are quoted prices for identical or com-
parable assets in active markets where the comparability
between security and benchmark defines the fair value
level. The income approach in most cases means a dis-
counted cash flow method where either the cash flow or
the discount curve is adjusted to reflect credit risk and
liquidity risk, using interest rates and yield curves com-
monly observable at frequent intervals. Depending on the
observability of these parameters, the security is classi-
fied in level 2 or level 3.

— Equity securities

Generally, if available and if the market is defined as ac-
tive, fair value is equal to the market price.

In the opposite case, the fair value is determined using
the market and income approach. Primary inputs to the
market approach are quoted prices for identical or com-
parable assets in active markets where the comparability
between security and benchmark defines the fair value
level. The income approach in most cases means a dis-
counted cash flow method estimating the present value
of future dividends. Depending on the observability of
these parameters, the security is classified in level 2 or
level 3.

— Investments fund units

Generally, if available and if the market is defined as ac-
tive, fair value is equal to the market price.

In the opposite case, the fair value of IFU is mainly de-
termined using net asset values (NAV) provided by the
fund’s managers provided by the subjects responsible
for the NAV calculation. This value is based on the valua-
tion of the underlying assets carried out through the use
of the most appropriate approach and inputs, eventually
adjusted for illiquidity and consequently hierarchized in
accordance with the quality of used inputs. Moreover,
depending on how the share value is collected, directly
from public providers or through counterparts, the ap-
propriate hierarchy level is assigned. If this NAV equals
the price at which the quote can be effectively traded
on the market in any moment, the Group considers this
value comparable to the market price.

— Private equity funds and Hedge funds

Generally, if available and if the market is defined as ac-
tive, fair value is equal to the market price.

In the opposite case, the fair value of private equity funds
and hedge funds is generally expressed as the net asset
value at the balance sheet date, determined using peri-
odical net asset value and audited financial statements
provided by fund administrators. If at the balance sheet
date, such information is not available, the latest official
net asset value is used. The fair value of these invest-
ments is also closely monitored by a team of profession-
als within the Group.

— Derivatives

Generally, if available and if the market is defined as ac-
tive, fair value is equal to the market price.
