Investments

In the table below Group investments are split into the
four IAS categories, as reported on balance sheet, as
well as by nature (equity instruments, fixed income in-

and cash and similar instruments).

are therefore allocated within the items equity instru-
ments, fixed income instruments, real estate instruments,
other investments and cash and similar instruments.
