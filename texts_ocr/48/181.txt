As for measurement and disclosure, the fair value de-
pends on the unit of account, depending on whether the
asset or liability is a stand-alone asset or liability, a group
of assets, a group of liabilities or a group of assets and
liabilities in accordance with the related IFRS.

However when determining fair value, the valuation
should reflect its use if in combination with other assets.

With reference to non-financial assets, fair value meas-
urement of a non-financial asset takes into account a
market participant's ability to generate economic bene-
fits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by
selling it to another market participant that would use the
asset in its highest and best use. The highest and best
use of a non-financial asset takes into account the use of
the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible
and financially feasible. However, an entity’s current use
of a non-financial asset is presumed to be its highest and
best use unless market or other factors suggest that a
different use by market participants would maximise the
value of the asset.

For the liabilities, the fair value is represented by the
price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an or-
derly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous)
market at the measurement date under current market
conditions (i.e. an exit price).

When a quoted price for the transfer of an identical or
a similar liability or entity’s own equity instrument is not
available and the identical item is held by another par-
ty as an asset, an entity shall measure the fair value of
the liability or equity instrument from the perspective of
a market participant that holds the identical item as an
asset at the measurement date.

Fair value hierarchy

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the consol-
idated financial statements are measured and classified
in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in IFRS13,
which consists of three levels based on the observability
of inputs within the corresponding valuation techniques
used.

The fair value hierarchy levels are based on the type of
inputs used to determine the fair value with the use of

adequate valuation techniques, which shall maximize the

market observable inputs and limit the use of unobserv-

able inputs:

— Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity
can access at the measurement date.

— Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included with-
in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly (i.e. quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability; market-corroborat-
ed inputs).

— Level 3: inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or
liability, which reflect the assumptions that market par-
ticipants would use when pricing the asset or liability,
including assumptions about risk (of the model used
and of inputs used).

The fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety
in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest
level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the en-
tire measurement requires judgement, taking into account
factors specific to the asset or liability.

A fair value measurement developed using a present value
technique might be categorised within Level 2 or Level 3,
depending on the inputs that are significant to the entire
measurement and the level of the fair value hierarchy with-
in which those inputs are categorised.

If an observable input requires an adjustment using an
unobservable input and that adjustment results in a signif-
icantly higher or lower fair value measurement, the result-
ing measurement would be categorised within the level
attributable to the input with the lowest level utilized.

Adequate controls have been set up to monitor all meas-
urements including those provided by third parties. If
these checks show that the measurement is not con-
sidered as market corroborated the instrument must be
classified in level 3. In this case, generally the main inputs
used in the valuation techniques are volatility, interest rate,
yield curves, credit spreads, dividend estimates and for-
eign exchange rates.
