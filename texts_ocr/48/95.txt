A. Executive Summary

The purpose of the Risk Report is to provide an overview
of the Group’s solvency position and risk profile, as well
as its risk management framework.

To this end a brief introduction on economic and regula-
tory environment is hereby provided.

When addressing the Group’s risk profile, it is important
to consider that the insurance sector is mostly vulnera-
ble to financial markets and the economic environment.
Generali has proven to be resilient to both financial risks
and credit risks. Nevertheless, financial instability still
represents the key challenge for the insurance sector.

At the same time, in addition to financial, underwriting
risks and operational risks, emerging trends related to
rapid growth of digitalization and big data, geopolitical
instability, natural catastrophes and demographic chang-
es represent a considerable challenge for the insurance
market.

In addition to the financial environment, regulatory de-
velopments represent a major external driver of threats
and opportunities to insurance Legal Entities. These
include developments in the area of prudential su-
pervisory regimes, such as Solvency Il, International
Capital Standards (ICS), as well as regulations defin-
ing new principles in terms of distribution (Insurance
Distribution Directive - IDD), new disclosure requirements
for Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment
Products (PRIIPs Regulation), personal data protection
(General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR) and an-
ti-money laundering (IV AML Directive).

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

In terms of solvency position, the Group and all its
European insurance subsidiaries comply with Solvency II
regulation, which requires capital to be held for all quan-
tifiable risks.

The Group uses its Partial Internal Model (PIM), approved
by the Supervisory Authority, to calculate capital require-
ments to better reflect its risk profile. The Group PIM au-
thorization was granted for all major Business Units (Italy,
Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland and the major
Czech company) while an extension plan is in progress
to cover the Spanish companies and the operational risk.

The Solvency Ratio, estimated on the basis of preliminary
data’, amounts to 216% as at 31 December 2018, con-
firming the strong capital position of the Group.

For the purpose of the Solvency Ratio calculation, the
Group Legal Entities for which authorization has been
granted apply the Group PIM, while other insurance enti-
ties adopt the standard formula. Other financial regulated
entities contribute to the Group Solvency Ratio based on
local sectorial regulatory requirements (e.g. mostly banks
and pension funds).

For risks not included in Solvency Capital Requirement
(SCR) calculation, additional assessment techniques are
used. In particular, for liquidity risk, the Group has in place
procedures and limits that ensure the adequate liquidity
risk management and a sound liquidity position.

Generali Group risk management system is based on a
clear risk governance and structured risk management
processes, defined within a set of risk policies. Within the
risk management system, the Own Risk and Solvency
Assessment (ORSA) represents the main risk reporting
tool, with the purpose of supporting risk strategy update
(Risk Appetite Framework).

Generali Group also relies on a set of tools, such as the
Recovery Plan, the Liquidity Risk Management Plan and
the Systemic Risk Management Plan, defined following

On the basis of IVASS Provvedimento n. 53, 2016, the SCR and MCR calculations to be disclosed in the Annual Report can rely on a preliminary estimate. More details on the

Solvency Ratio will be disclosed in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report.
