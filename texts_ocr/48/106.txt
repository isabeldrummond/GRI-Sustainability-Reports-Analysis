D. Risk Profile
Life Underwriting Risk

Life and health underwriting risks derive from the Group’s
core insurance business in the life and health segment.
The major part of the business and the related risks derive
from direct portfolio underwritten by the Group. Health
business represents a minor component of the portfolio.

The life portfolio is given by traditional business, which
mainly includes insurance with profit participation,
and unit-linked products. The prevailing component
of traditional savings business includes products with
insurance coverages linked to the policyholders’ life
and health. It also includes pure risk covers, with re-
lated mortality risk, and some annuity portfolios, with
the presence of longevity risk. The vast majority of the
insurance coverages include legal or contractual pol-
icyholder rights to fully or partly terminate, surrender,
decrease, restrict or suspend insurance cover or per-
mit the insurance policy to lapse, or to fully or partially
establish, renew, increase, extend or resume the insur-
ance or reinsurance cover. For this reason, the products
are subject to lapse risk.

Life underwriting risks can be distinguished in biometric
and operating risks embedded in the life and health in-
surance policies. Biometric risks derive from the uncer-
tainty in the assumptions regarding mortality, longevity,
health, morbidity and disability rates taken into account
in the insurance liability valuations. Operating risks derive
from the uncertainty regarding the amount of expenses
and the adverse exercise of contractual options by pol-
icyholders. Policy lapse is the main contractual option
held by the policyholders, together with the possibility
to reduce, suspend or partially surrender the insurance
coverage.

Life and health underwriting risks are:

- mortality risk, defined as the risk of loss, or of adverse
change in the value of insurance liabilities, resulting
from changes in mortality rates, where an increase in
mortality rates leads to an increase in the value of in-
surance liabilities. Mortality risk also includes mortality
catastrophe risk, resulting from the significant uncer-

tainty of pricing and provisioning assumptions related
to extreme or irregular events;

— longevity risk that, similarly to mortality, is defined as
the risk resulting from changes in mortality rates, where
a decrease in mortality rates leads to an increase in the
value of insurance liabilities;

— disability and morbidity risks derive from changes in
the disability, sickness, morbidity and recovery rates;

— lapse risk is linked to the loss or adverse change in lia-
bilities due to a change in the expected exercise rates
of policyholder options. The relevant options are all le-
gal or contractual policyholder rights to fully or partly
terminate, surrender, decrease, restrict or suspend in-
surance cover or permit the insurance policy to lapse.
Mass lapse events are also considered;

— expense risk results from changes in the expenses in-
curred in servicing insurance or reinsurance contracts;

— health risk results from changes in health claims and
also includes catastrophe risk (for PIM entities).

In addition to the risks above, the Group Risk Map in-
cludes also the going concern reserve risk, a German
business specific risk that refers to mis-estimation of new
business assumptions.

The approach underlying the life underwriting risk meas-
urement is based on the calculation of the loss resulting
from unexpected changes in biometric and/or operating
assumptions. Capital requirements for life underwriting
risks are calculated on the basis of the difference be-
tween the insurance liabilities before and after the appli-
cation of the stress.

Life underwriting risks are measured by means of the
Group PIM".

The SCR for life underwriting risk amounts to € 3,437
million before diversification (equal to 11% of total SCR
before diversification). This is mainly given by expense’*
risk, followed by lapse and longevity risks. In terms of
contribution to the risk profile, it is to be noted that life
underwriting risks are well diversified with other risk cate-
gories. The overall contribution to the risk profile therefore
remains limited.

Life underwriting risk management is based on two main
processes:

— accurate pricing;

— ex-ante selection of risks through underwriting.

formula.
