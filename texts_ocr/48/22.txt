2. A strong brand

Generali strives to create a brand experience aligned with the Group’s goal of becoming a life-time partner to its
customers.

We strive to be proactive and focused on customer relationships and integrate protection, prevention and
assistance, creating tailor-made products and services that meet our clients’ needs. Our agents are at the very heart
of this transformation. Data and technology are the crucial levers that give our distribution networks the opportunity
to customize and adapt our products and services. Continuous connectivity and real-time support will enable us to
create faster and more consistent experiences that will delight our clients.

Being a life-time partner to customers allows us to transform our role from a mere product vendor to a provider of
integrated solutions that add genuine value to people’s lives, their health, their home, their mobility and their work.
We are committed to strengthening our brand" to become 1* choice in the Relationship Net Promoter Score among
our European international peers by the end of 2021, to foster new business development. We thus must get
consumers to consider, prefer and acquire Generali, and connect them with our agents. Our goal is to have a higher
brand preference than our market share.

3. A continuous commitment to sustainability a

  

The Group’s new strategy is aligned with our sustainability commitments. Generali has undertaken to increase
premiums from social and green products by 7%-9% and allocate € 4.5 billion for green and sustainable
investments by the end of 2021.

Transition towards a low environmental impact company

As stated in our climate change strategy approved by the Board of Directors in February 2018 and explained in more
detail in the technical note published by the Group in November 2018, our commitment calls for specific actions
with regard to the direct impact of our activities as well as investments and underwriting, and identifies stakeholder
dialogue and engagement as the instruments to support our transition.

With respect to investments, as already announced, the Group has suspended all new investments in companies
inked to the coal sector. As regards its existing exposure, estimated at around € 2 billion at the start of 2018,
Generali is completing the disposal of its equity investments by the planned deadline of April 2019 and gradually
disinvesting from bonds, by holding them to maturity and/or assessing the possibility of disposing of them before
they mature if market conditions are favourable.

In terms of green and sustainable investments, the internally planned objectives of the 2018 investment plan were
successfully met. As expected, the Group decided to revise its initial commitment of € 3.5 billion in new investments
by the end of 2020 up to € 4.5 billion by the end of 2021.

In terms of underwriting, in 2018 we did not increase our minimal insurance exposure to coal-related businesses,
which represent roughly 0.1% of all P&C premiums, also thanks to our commitment not to insure any new coal
customer or any new mine or coal-fuelled power plant construction.

With reference to the renewable energy sector, in which Generali already has a strong presence, the Group is
defining concrete actions to transfer knowledge and best practices in all geographical areas. It is also considering
the possibility of defining a dedicated industrial practice.
