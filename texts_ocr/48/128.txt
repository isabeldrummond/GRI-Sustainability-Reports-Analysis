4. understanding of the processes that lead to the generation, detection and management of
significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the DNF.
In particular, we have conducted interviews and discussions with the management of

Generali Versicherung AG (Austria), Ceska pojist'ovna a.s., Generali France S.A., Generali
Deutschland AG, Generali Personenversicherungen AG, Generali Espafia 5.A. de Seguros y
Reaseguros and we have performed limited documentary evidence procedures, in order to
collect information about the processes and procedures that support the collection,
aggregation, processing and transmission of non-financial data and information to the
management responsible for the preparation of the DNF.

Furthermore, for significant information, considering the Group's activities and
characteristics:

- at Group level,

a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the DNF, and in
particular to the business model, policies implemented and main risks, we
carried out inquiries and acquired supporting documentation to verify its
consistency with the available evidence;

b) with reference to quantitative information, we have performed both analytical
procedures and limited assurance procedures to ascertain on a sample basis
the correct aggregation of data.

- For the following companies, Generali Italia S.p.A., Generali Versicherung AG (Austria),
Ceska pojist'ovna a.s., Generali France $.A., Generali Deutschland AG, Generali
Personenversicherungen AG, Generali Espana S.A. de Sequros y Reaseguros, which we
have selected based on their significance to the Group and to their Country, taking into
consideration their activity and the contribution to the performance indicators, we have
carried out site visits during which we have had discussions with management and have
obtained evidence about the appropriate application of the procedures and the
calculation methods used to determine the indicators.

Conclusion

Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that
DNF of the Generali Group for the year ended 31 December 2018 has not been prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with the requirements of articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and the
selected GRI Standards, as illustrated in the Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial
Statements 2018 section “Note to the Management Report".
