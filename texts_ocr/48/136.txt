| We, Generali | Risk Report | Outlook | Statement

With reference to holding costs, the general expenses
incurred for management and coordination are consid-
ered as operating, by the Parent Company and territorial
sub-holdings.

In addition, non-operating holding expenses include:

— interest expenses on financial debt’,

— restructuring charges and other non-recurring expens-
es incurred in the management and coordination ac-
tivities,

— costs arising from the assignment of stock options and
stock grants by the Group.

The operating result and non-operating result of the
Group are equivalent to the sum of the operating result
and the non-operating result of the abovementioned seg-
ments and related consolidation adjustments.

In accordance with the approach described above, the
Generali Group also provided the operating result in the
main countries where it operates for the Life and Property
& Casualty segments and the consolidated figures. In or-

der to provide a management view of the operating result
by geographical area, the review of the key performance
indicators by business segment and geographical area
allows measurement of the result of each geographical
area from a country viewpoint instead of as a contribution
to the Group’s results.

Within the context of the life and Property & Casualty
operating result of each country, reinsurance operations
between Group companies in different countries were
considered by the same standards as transactions con-
cluded with external reinsurers. This representation of the
life and Property & Casualty operating result by territory
makes this performance indicator more consistent with
both the risk management policies implemented by each
company and the other indicators measuring the techni-
cal profitability of the Group’s companies.

erating result with the corresponding income statement
