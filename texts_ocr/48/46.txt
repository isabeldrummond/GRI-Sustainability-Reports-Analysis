margin net of insurance operating expenses. The invest-
ment result was down due to the higher impairments on
financial instruments, especially posted in the last quarter
of the year.

The P&C operating result, equal to € 1,992 million, in-
creased by 2.5%, reflecting the contribution from invest-
ment result, albeit in the context of a persistently low level

Operating result by country

The Asset Management segment, introduced starting
from 31 December 2018 to better reflect the results of the
Group’s asset manager activities in line with the strate-
gic communication to the market , achieved an operating
result of € 335 million thanks to the increase in revenues
arising from portfolio management activities.

The improvement in the Holding and other businesses
operating result reflected the positive result of other pri-
vate equity and real estate activities.

Finally, the change in the consolidation adjustments was
mainly due to higher dividends and intra-group realized
gains.
