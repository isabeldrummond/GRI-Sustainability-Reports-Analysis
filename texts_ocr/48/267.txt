Fair value bonus related to market condition

The related cost on overall plan is resulted from the mul-
tiplication, weighted for each tranche, of the above men-
tioned fair value with the number of rights related to the
market condition, to be assigned based on the satisfac-
tion of the vesting condition.

A similar calculation was applied to the bonus portion
linked to the ROE, identifying the pay-out through the lin-
ear interpolation applied to the level of RoE considered
most probable. The range applied to the linear interpola-
tion is included between the maximum pay-out, granted
in case of a level of RoE equal to or greater than 13%,
and a pay-out equal to 0 in case of a level of RoE equal
to or lower than 11%.

Finally, the cost related to the recognition of dividends
paid during the three-year period (so called dividend
equivalent) was estimated by applying an estimated div-
idend to the expected number of shares to be assigned
under the plan, based on the degree of achievement as-
sessed as above described.

The overall cost of the LT] plans 2016, 2017 and 2018,
sum of the three components above mentioned, is al-
located over a period of maturity of 3 years (vesting pe-
riod) starting from the first financial year on which the
performance levels are assessed, with a corresponding
increase in equity.

In addition, last year, during Shareholders’ Meeting has
been approved a special Stock Plan for the Managing
Director / Group CEO.

The Plan involves the free award of a maximum of n.
200.000 ordinary Assicurazioni Generali shares, subject
to the following conditions being met:

- the Managing Director/Group CEO continuing to hold
his existing n. 200.000 Assicurazioni Generali shares,
acquired with his own means, until the end of his cur-
rent term in office;

- achieving a specific three-year Total Shareholders Re-
turn (TSR) target of +72.8%, calculated over the period
from July 2016 to July 2019;

- maintaining Economic Solvency Ratio thresholds

6.47 6.34 6.50

at 130% or different percentage defined later by the
Board of directors

- maintaining the position as Managing Director/Group
CEO until the end of the current term (therefore losing
all rights in the event of termination of the working re-
lationship for any reason before the end of this term).

Furthermore, the Plan calls for the award of additional
shares, determined on the basis of the amount of the
overall dividends distributed during the reference period,
according to a dividend equivalent mechanism.

The Plan also obligates the Managing Director/Group
CEO to retain 50% of the shares awarded to him for free
for at least two years, as well as other standard sustaina-
bility clauses (e.g. malus, clawback, hedging restrictions)
to protect financial solidity and the Group’s non-exces-
sive exposure to risk.

The condition related to TSR configures as a market con-
dition, other conditions mentioned above are considered
as service condition.

The estimated fair value of the bonus right subject to the
performance in terms of TRS was calculated by multi-
plying the share price at the Plan’s approval grant date
with the pay-out given linearly interpolating the probable
TSR, estimated by applying a statistical model for the
possible evolution of the share price in the three years
considered.

The relative cost of the overall plan is obtained by multi-
plying the market value above mentioned (amounting to
EUR 2.4) with the number of rights relating to the market
condition, assignable on the basis of the achievement
of vesting condition; the cost related to the recogni-
tion of dividends paid during the three-year period (so
called dividend equivalent) was estimated by applying a
deemed dividend to the expected number of shares to be
assigned under the Plan.

The total cost of the plan, sum of the two components
described above, was allocated over a period of accrual
of three years in line with the service period required.
