erates in different activities, with an absolutely residual
impact on revenues and income. The revenues arising
from these activities are included in the item “Other in-
come” and further detailed in note 31.

The asset/liabilities arising from contracts with custom-
ers are not significant, in particular due to the above illus-
trated business.

In the recognition of the impact on the revenues already
accounted for in the past period, the Group applied the
simplified retrospective approach, which requires the
recognition of the cumulative effect of initially applying
the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of
retained earnings.

The Group assessed the economic and accounting ef-
fects of the standard and there are not significant im-
pacts on the economic and financial position.

The standard is effective from annual period that started
at 1 January 2018.

New accounting principles and
amendments not yet applicable

IFRS 9 — Financial instruments

IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Classifi-
cation and Measurement” and includes a principle-based
model for the classification and measurement of financial
instruments, an impairment model based on expected
losses and an hedge accounting approach more in line
with risk management strategies.

Classification and measurement

IFRS 9 introduces an approach to the classification of
debt instruments that is based on contractual cash flows
characteristics and models through which financial in-
struments are managed (business model).

In particular, the classification of financial instruments is
driven by the business model through which the compa-
ny manages its investments and the contractual terms of
their cash flows.

A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if both of

the following conditions are met:

— the asset is held to collect cash flows (business model
assessment)

— the contractual cash flows represent only payments of

principal and interest (solely payments of principal and
interest - SPPI).

Considering to the contractual characteristics, a financial
instrument is eligible for measurement at amortized cost
if it consists in a basic lending agreement. The entity shall
make its own assessment on the single financial instru-
ment to assess if the nature of the contractual cash flows
characteristics exclusively consists in payments of princi-
pal and interest (SPPI). If a modification of the time value
of the interest results in cash flows that are significantly
different than those of a basic lending agreement then the
instrument must be classified and measured at fair value
through profit or loss.

If the business model (assessed on portfolio basis) has
the objective to collect the cash flows from the invest-
ments and to sell financial assets and the contractual
cash flows characteristics represent only payments of
principal and interest, the financial instrument under as-
sessment shall be measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income with recycling to profit or loss
when the instrument is realized.

As in the current IAS 39 Financial Instruments: classifi-
cation and measurement the entity has the ability at ini-
tial recognition, to designate a financial instrument at fair
value through profit or loss if that would eliminate or sig-
nificantly reduce the accounting mismatch in the meas-
urement of assets or liabilities or recognition of gains and
losses related to them.

The equity instruments shall be classified and measured
at fair value through profit or loss. The entity has the ir-
revocable option at initial recognition to present changes
in the fair value of the equity instruments that are not held
for the purpose of trading at fair value recorded in other
comprehensive income, with no recycling in the income
statement except dividends.

In other cases, the financial instruments are classified
and measured at fair value through profit or loss, which is
the residual model.

The Group is assessing the impacts of the new classifi-
cation model. For further information see the following
paragraph ‘Implementation of the standard. Overall, the
Group expects to have limited impacts on the classifi-
cation and measurement of instruments, in particular as
