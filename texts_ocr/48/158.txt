those policies. If an investor holds, directly or indirectly
through subsidiaries, 20% or more of the voting power of
the investee, it is presumed that the investor has signifi-
cant influence.

In general, joint arrangements are contractual agree-
ments whereby the Group undertakes with other parties
an economic activity that is subject to joint control. In-
vestments in joint arrangements are classified as either
joint operations or joint ventures depending on the con-
tractual rights and obligations each investor has rather
than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. A joint
venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties
that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to
the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control exists
when it is contractually agreed to share control of an eco-
nomic activity, which exists only when decisions about
the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of
the parties sharing control.

Generali Group has assessed the nature of its current
joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ven-
tures and none are joint operations.

The considerations made in determining significant in-
fluence or joint control are similar to those necessary to
determine control over subsidiaries. Investments in as-
sociates and joint ventures are accounted for using the
equity method and they are initially recognized at cost,
which includes goodwill arising on acquisition. Goodwill
is not separately tested for impairment. Negative good-
will is recognized in the income statement on the acquisi-
tion date. The carrying amount of the investment is sub-
sequently adjusted to recognize changes in the Group’s
share of the net assets of the associate or joint venture
since the acquisition date. The income statements re-
flects the Group’s share of the results of operations of
the associate or joint venture. Any change in OCI of those
investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. Div-
idends receivable from associates are recognized as a
reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

At each reporting date, after application of the equity
method the Group determines whether there is objec-
tive evidence that the investment in the associate or joint
venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group
calculates the amount of impairment as the difference be-
tween the recoverable amount of the associate or joint
venture and its carrying value, then recognizes the loss
as ‘Share of losses of an associate’ in the income state-
ment. Where the Group’s share of losses in an associate
equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including

any other unsecured long-term receivables, the group
does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate
or joint venture.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or
joint control over the joint venture the Group measures
and recognizes and retained investment at its fair value.
Any difference between the net proceeds and the fair
value of the retained interest and the carrying amount is
recognized in the income statement and gains and loss-
es previously recorded directly through OCI are reversed
and recorded through the income statement.

Significant judgements in
determining control, joint control
and significant influence over an
entity

The control is normally ensured by the full ownership of
the voting rights, having thus the ability to direct the rel-
evant activities and consequently being exposed to the
variability of results arising from those activities.

The Group controls all the companies for which holds
more than half of the voting rights. The Group does not
control any subsidiary having less than the majority of
voting rights and does not control any entity even though
it holds more than half of the voting rights, except in two
cases in which the Group controls the company owning
half of the voting rights, being exposed to the variability
of returns that depend on the operating policies that the
Group, in substance, has the power to direct .

To a minor extent, the Group holds interests in associ-
ates and joint ventures. The agreements under which the
Group has joint control of a separate vehicle are qualified
as joint ventures where they give rights to the net assets.

In one case, the Group has no significant influence on
a subject for which it holds more than 20% of the vot-
ing rights as the government structure is such that the
Group, in substance, does not have the power to partic-
ipate in financial and operating policies of the investee.

Regardless of the legal form of the investment, the evalu-
ation of the control is made considering the real power on
the investee and the practical ability to influence relevant
activities, regardless of the voting rights held by the par-
ent company or its subsidiaries.
