Responsible investments

€289 bin (-2.2%) direct investments of Group insurance companies
to which the Responsible Investment Guideline is applied

In implementation of the Responsible Investment Guideline
- the document which regulates the various responsible in-
vestment activities at Group level - we identify, evaluate
and monitor issuing companies in the portfolio which are
involved in controversial sectors (for example, non-con-
ventional weapons) or in activities that involve serious or
systematic violations of human rights, serious environmen-
tal damage or corruption.

Thanks to the creation of a proprietary ESG methodology
- which considers environmental, social and corporate
governance aspects - we evaluate the degree of
responsibility and involvement of the issuing companies
and promote specific actions with respect to them, ranging
from a ban on making new investments to the settlement
of current holdings or the retention of same until their
expiration with no possibility of renewal, or even direct
dialogue to encourage them to act responsibly.

A cross-functional committee named Responsible Invest-
ment Committee retains the task of supporting the deci-
sions of the Group Chief Investment Officer in relation to po-
tential exclusions from the investable universe of the Group.

Climate strategy

In line with the principles of responsible investment which
we have been applying for years, and in execution of
the Group Policy for the Environment and Climate, we
have defined our commitment, even through investment
activities, to mitigate climate change and transition towards
energy sources as alternatives to carbon and fossil fuels.

Sustainable and responsible investment funds

Thanks to a methodology developed internally by a
dedicated team - which integrates non-financial and
traditional financial aspects - we select the best companies
in relation to corporate social responsibility and sustainable
development policies in order to establish dedicated SRI
(Socially Responsible Investment) funds and mandates.
At 31 December 2018, the methodology was applied
to funds and mandates totalling € 33.2 billion in assets
(-2.1%)*. Of these, 81.4% was subject to the SRI analysis
and reported a compliance rate of more than 90% with
the Group’s SRI principles. The remaining 18.6% was
not covered by the SRI analysis (funds of funds, issuers
located in non-European regions, unlisted issuers).

Stewardship

As a responsible investor, we undertake to promote
sustainability in our investees through proxy voting and
engagement activities. To this end, the Group has developed
a Voting Guideline which expresses our fundamental
values, including with respect to sustainability. In 2018,
the Group participated in 1,201 Shareholders’ Meetings
and voted on 15,257 resolutions, 13% against, confirming
the Group’s commitment to support sustainability best
practices.
