tralized their management and monitoring. These kinds
of investments are subject to accurate due diligence in
order to assess their quality, the level of risk related to the
investment and its consistency with the approved liabili-
ty-driven SAA.

The Group also uses derivatives with the aim of mitigat-
ing the risk present in the asset and/or liability portfolios.
The derivatives help the Group to improve the quality,
liquidity and profitability of the portfolio, according to the
business planning targets. Operations in derivatives are
likewise subject to a regular monitoring and reporting
process.

In addition to the risk tolerance limits set on the Group
solvency position within the Group RAF, the current
Group risk monitoring process is also integrated by the
application of the Group Investments Risk Guidelines
(GIRG). The GIRG include general principles, quantitative
risk limits (with a strong focus on credit and market con-
centration), authorization processes and prohibitions that
Group entities need to comply with.

Financial Risk

Within the life business, the Group assumes a consider-
able financial risk when it guarantees policyholders with
a minimum return on the accumulated capital over a,
potentially, long period. Should the yields generated by
the financial investments be lower than the guaranteed
return, then the Group shall compensate the shortfall for
those contractual guarantees. In addition, independently
on the achieved asset returns, the Group has to secure
that the value of the financial investments backing the in-
surance contracts remains sufficient to meet the value of
its obligations.

Unit-linked business typically does not represent a source
of direct financial risk for insurers (except when there are
guarantees embedded in the contracts), although market
fluctuations typically have profitability implications.

Regarding P&C business, the Group has to ensure that
the benefits can be paid on a timely basis when claims
occur.

In more detail, the Group is exposed to the following ge-
neric financial risk types:

— equity risk deriving from the risk of adverse changes in
the market value of the assets or in the value of liabili-
ties due to changes in the level of equity market prices
which can lead to financial losses;

- equity volatility risk deriving from changes in the vola-
tility of equity markets. Exposure to equity volatility is
typically related to equity option contracts or to insur-
ance products sold with embedded guarantees whose
market consistent value is sensitive to the level of eq-
uity volatility;

— interest rate risk, defined as the risk of adverse chang-
es in the market value of the assets or in the value of
liabilities due to changes in the level of interest rates
in the market. The Group is mostly exposed to down-
ward changes in interest rates as lower interest rates
increase the present value of the promises made to
policyholders more than the value of the assets back-
ing those promises. As a result, it may become in-
creasingly costly for the Group to maintain its promis-
es, thereby leading to financial losses. Linked to that,
interest rate volatility risk derives from changes in the
level of interest rate implied volatilities. This comes, for
example, from insurance products sold with embed-
ded minimum interest rate guarantees whose market
consistent value is sensitive to the level of interest
rates volatility;

— property risk deriving from changes in the level of prop-
erty market prices. Exposure to property risk arises
from property asset positions;

- currency risk deriving from adverse changes in ex-
change rates;

- concentration risk deriving from asset portfolio con-
centration to a small number of counterparties.

Financial risks are measured by means of the Group

PIM‘. In particular, losses are modelled as follows:

— equity risk is modelled by associating each equity ex-
posure to a market index representative of its industrial
sector and/or geography. Potential changes in market
value of the equities are then estimated based on past
shocks observed for the selected indices;

— equity volatility risk models the impact that changes in
the equity implied volatility can have on the market val-
ues of derivatives;

— interest rate risk models the changes in the term struc-
ture of the interest rates for various currencies and the
