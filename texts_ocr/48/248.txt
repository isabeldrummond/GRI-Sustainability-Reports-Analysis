With respect to the 2018 fiscal year, the effective tax
rate was equal to 32.6%, in line with that of the previous
fiscal year. The reduction of the tax burden in absolute
terms is essentially due to the slight reduction of the
profit before tax.

With regards to fiscal losses, it is worth noting that Italian
Law by Decree 98/2011 introduced that fiscal losses can
be carried forward with no time limits (as opposed to the
previous five-year limitation). Losses from a given year
may, however, only be used to offset up to 80% of the
taxable income of any following fiscal year.

Deferred income taxes are calculated on the temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities reported in the financial statements and their
tax base, by using the tax rates applicable at the expect-
ed time of realisation according to each country’s current
legislation.

The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is depend-
ent on the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible.

Furthermore, in making this assessment, management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabili-
ties and tax planning strategies.

Assessments show that deferred tax assets will be re-
covered in the future through either (i) expected taxable
income of each consolidated company or (ii) expected
taxable income of other companies included in the same
tax group (e.g. “Consolidato fiscale” in Italy, “Steuerliche
Organschaft” in Germany and “Régime d’intégration fis-
cale” in France).

Deferred taxes are related to the following assets and li-
abilities.
