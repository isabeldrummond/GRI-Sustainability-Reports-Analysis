Non-life underwriting risks are measured by means of the
Group PIM". For the majority of risks assessed through
the PIM, the assessments are based on in-house devel-
oped models and external models that are primarily used
to assess the catastrophic events, for which broad mar-
ket experience is considered beneficial.

The SCR for non-life underwriting risk amounts to € 4,071
million before diversification (equal to 13% of total SCR
before diversification). This is mainly given by reserve and
pricing risks, followed by CAT risk. Non-life lapse risk
contributes only for a marginal amount to the risk profile.

Moreover, the Group uses additional indicators for risk
concentrations. This is specifically the case for catastro-
phe risks and commercial risks, which are both coordi-
nated at central level as they generally represent a key
source of concentration.

In terms of CAT risk, the Group’s largest exposures are
earthquakes in Italy, European floods and European
windstorms. Less material catastrophe risks are also
taken into account and assessed by means of additional
scenario analysis.

At the same time, there is a constant on-going improve-
ment to consider risk metrics within profitability metrics
and to use risk adjusted KPls in decision making pro-
cesses.

Based on the Group RAF, P&C risk selection starts with
an overall proposal in terms of underwriting strategy and
corresponding business selection criteria. During the
strategic planning process, targets are established and
translated into underwriting limits to ensure business is
underwritten according to the Plan. Underwriting limits
define the maximum size of risks and classes of business
that Group Legal Entities shall be allowed to write with-
out seeking any additional or prior approval. The limits
may be set based on value, risk type, product exposure
or class of occupancy. The purpose of these limits is to
attain a coherent and profitable book of business found-
ed on the expertise of each Legal Entity.

Additional indicators such as relevant exposures, risk
concentration and risk capital figures are used for the
purpose of P&C underwriting risk monitoring. The indi-
cators are calculated on a quarterly basis to ensure align-
ment with the Group RAF.

Reinsurance is the key mitigating technique for balanc-
ing the P&C portfolio. It aims to optimize the use of risk
capital by ceding part of the underwriting risk to select-
ed counterparties, whilst simultaneously minimizing the
credit risk associated with such operations.

The P&C Group Reinsurance Strategy is developed con-
sistently with the risk appetite and the risk preferences
defined in the Group RAF on the one side and taking into
account the reinsurance market on the other one.

The Group has historically preferred traditional reinsur-
ance as a tool for mitigating catastrophe risk resulting
from its P&C portfolio, adopting a centralized approach
where the placement of reinsurance towards the market is
managed through a central Group Reinsurance Function.

Generali aims at diversifying its cessions to reinsurers to
avoid excessive concentrations, to optimize its reinsur-
ance purchases, including from a pricing perspective,
and to continuously develop know-how in the most in-
novative risk transfer techniques. For this reason, part
of the Italian earthquake, European windstorm and
European flood exposures were carved out from the tra-
ditional catastrophe reinsurance program and placed in
the Insurance Linked Securities (ILS) market. This inno-
vative issuance was completed successfully and at com-
petitive terms.

Alternative risk transfer solutions are continuously ana-
lysed and implemented. As an example, in addition to tra-
ditional reinsurance, a protection is in place to reduce the
impact of an unexpectedly high Loss Ratio for the Group
Motor liability portfolio. Such transfer represents a par-
tial transfer of pricing risk to the special purpose vehicle
named Horse.
