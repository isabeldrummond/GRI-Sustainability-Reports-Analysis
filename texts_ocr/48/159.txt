Foreign currency transactions and
balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded
by the Group’s entities at their respective functional cur-
rency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies
for recognition.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the functional currency spot
rates of exchange at the reporting date.

Differences arising on settlement or translation of mon-
etary items are recognised in profit or loss with the ex-
ception of monetary items that are designated as part of
the hedge of the Group's net investment of a foreign op-
eration. These are recognised in other comprehensive
income until the net investment is disposed of, at which
time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or
loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange
differences on those monetary items are also recorded
in other comprehensive income.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of his-
torical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the
date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss
arising on translation of non-monetary items measured
at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of gain
or loss on change in fair value of the item (i.e., transla-
tion differences on items whose fair value gain or loss
is recognised in other comprehensive income or profit
or loss are also recognised in other comprehensive in-
come or profit or loss, respectively).
