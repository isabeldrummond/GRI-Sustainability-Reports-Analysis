ment to assess if the nature of the contractual cash flows
characteristics exclusively consists in payments of princi-
pal and interest (SPPI.,). If a modification of the time value
of the interest results in cash flows that are significantly
different than those of a basic lending agreement then the
instrument must be classified and measured at fair value
through profit or loss.

Impairment

IFRS 9 introduced a new impairment approach for debt
instruments measured at amortized cost or fair value re-
corded in other comprehensive income, which is based
on expected losses. In particular, the new standard out-
lines an approach for the impairment in three stages
based on the assessment of credit quality from the date
of initial recognition at each balance sheet date:

— Stage 1 includes the financial instruments that have
not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial
recognition or that have low credit risk at the report-
ing date (investment grade). For these assets expected
losses (ECL) over the next 12 months (12-month ex-
pected credit losses - losses expected in view of the
possible occurrence of events of default in the next 12
months) are recognized in the profit or loss account. In-
terest is calculated on the carrying amount (ie without
deduction of the loss allowance);

— Stage 2 includes financial instruments that have had
a significant increase in credit risk since initial recog-
nition (unless they have low credit risk at the reporting
date) but that do not have objective evidence of impair-
ment. For these assets, lifetime ECL are recognised in
a capital reserve (loss allowance), and in the profit or
loss account , but interest revenue is still calculated
on the gross carrying amount of the asset. (i.e. without
deduction of the loss allowance);

- Stage 3 includes financial assets that have objective
evidence of impairment at the reporting date. For these
assets, lifetime ECL are recognised in a capital reserve
(loss allowance), and in the profit or loss account. In-
terest revenue is calculated on the net carrying amount
(that is, net of credit allowance).

The model also introduces a simplified approach to
trade receivables and leases for which it is not neces-
sary to calculate the 12-month expected credit losses
but are always recognized the lifetime expected credit
losses.

The Group is assessing the impact of the new impair-
ment model introduced by the standard and expects
significant operational impacts related to the implemen-
tation of the calculation process of the abovementioned

expected credit losses. In light of the high creditworthi-
ness of the debt securities, the new model Expected
Credit Losses should not result in significant impacts for
the Group.

Hedge accounting

IFRS 9 introduces a model substantially reformed for
hedge accounting that allows better than in IAS 39 to
reflect in financial statements the hedging activities un-
dertaken by risk management.

In particular there is a significant simplification of the

effectiveness test. There are no more predetermined

thresholds of coverage to achieve effective hedge (ie 80-

125% in the current IAS 39),but it is sufficient that:

— there is an economic relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item; and

- credit risk should not be the key component of the
hedged risk (i.e. the change in fair value of the hedging
relationship must not be dominated by the component
of credit risk).

The standard will be effective, in the case of endorse-
ment, from annual periods beginning on or after 1 Jan-
uary 2018. A transitional provision allows continuing to
apply IAS 39 for all hedging transactions until comple-
tion of the macrohedging project. The principle has been
endorsed by the European Union by the EU Regulation
2016/1905.

IFRS 4 — Applying IFRS 9 Financial
Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance
Contracts (Amendment to IFRS 4)

On 12 September 2016 the IASB published the amend-
ment “Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS
4 Insurance Contracts”, endorsed by EU Regulation
2017/1988 on 3 November 2017, that introduces the
possibility to defer the application of IFRS 9 for predom-
inantly insurers. The amendment aims to address the
concerns of the insurance industry arising from the mis-
alignment of effective dates of the new financial instru-
ments standard and IFRS 17, the international standard
on insurance contracts with effective date of 1 January
2021.

Both IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 are relevant for insurance en-
tities. The amendment aims to address the concerns of
insurance sector arising from the different effective dates
of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17.
