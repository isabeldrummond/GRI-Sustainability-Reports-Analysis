Following an agreement signed in
July 2018, closed the sale of the
entire shareholding in Generali
Worldwide Insurance Company
Limited, that has its headquarters

in Guernsey and specializes in
offering Life-insurance-based wealth
management and employee benefit
solutions to a global audience, and
in Generali Link, an Irish company
providing shared services in fund
and policy administration. However,
Generali Worldwide will continue to
act as the partner of the employee
benefits network of Generali and the
latter will manage its health portfolio
in the Caribbean, as to maintain its
presence in the region with the aim
to further reinforce it in line with its
strategy of sustainable growth and
excellence in service.

Announced the launch of Axis

Retail Partners, a new real estate
boutique focusing on shopping centre
investments. The partnership is in
line with Generali’s strategy to further
increase its exposure to real estate,
where it is already one of the world’s
leading investors through Generali
Real Estate.
