Financial Risk and Credit Risk

The Group invests collected premiums in a wide variety
of financial assets, with the purpose of honouring future
obligations to policyholders and generating value for its
shareholders.

As a result, the Group is exposed to the financial risks

driven by either:

— invested assets not performing as expected because
of falling or volatile market prices;

— reinvested proceeds of existing assets being exposed
to unfavourable market conditions, such as lower in-
terest rates.

Generali Group traditional life savings business is long-
term in nature; therefore, the Group holds mostly long-
term investments which have the ability to withstand
short-term decreases and fluctuations in the market value
of assets.

Nonetheless, the Group manages its investments in a
prudent way according to the so-called “Prudent Person
Principle”'®, and strives to optimize the return of its assets
while minimizing the negative impact of short-term mar-
ket fluctuations on its solvency position.

Under Solvency Il, the Group is also required to hold a
capital buffer, with the purpose of maintaining a sound
solvency position even in the circumstances of adverse
market movements.

To ensure a comprehensive management of the impact
of financial and credit risks on assets and liabilities, the
Group Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) process needs
to be liability-driven and strongly interdependent with in-
surance-specific targets and constraints. For this reason,
the Group has integrated the Strategic Asset Allocation
(SAA) and the Asset Liability Management (ALM) within
the same process.

The aim of the SAA&ALM process is to define the most
efficient combination of asset classes which, according
to the Prudent Person Principle, maximizes the invest-
ment contribution to value creation, taking into account
solvency, actuarial and accounting indicators. The aim
is not just to mitigate risks but also to define an optimal
risk-return profile that satisfies both the return target and

the risk appetite of the Group over the business planning
period.

The assets’ selection is performed by taking into consid-
eration the risk profile of the liabilities held in order to sat-
isfy the need to have appropriate and sufficient assets to
cover the liabilities. This selection process aims to guar-
antee the security, quality, profitability and liquidity of the
overall portfolio, providing an adequate diversification of
the investments.

The asset portfolio is then invested and rebalanced ac-
cording to the asset class and duration weights. The main
risk mitigation techniques used by the Group are liabili-
ty-driven management of the assets and regular use of
rebalancing.

The liability driven investment helps granting a compre-
hensive management of assets whilst taking into account
the liability structure; while, at the same time, the regular
rebalancing redefines target weights for the different as-
set classes and durations, alongside the related tolerance
ranges defined as investment limits. This technique con-
tributes to an appropriate mitigation of financial risks.

ALM&SAA activities aim at ensuring the Group holds suf-
ficient and adequate assets to reach defined targets and
meet liability obligations. For this purpose, analyses of
the asset-liability relationship under a range of market
scenarios and expected/stressed investment conditions
are undertaken.

The Group works to ensure a close interaction between

the Investment, Finance (incl. Treasury), Actuarial and

Risk Management Functions to secure that the ALM&SAA

process remains consistent with the Group Risk Appetite

Framework (RAF), the strategic planning and the capital

allocation mechanisms. The annual SAA proposal:

- defines target exposure and limits for each relevant as-
set class, in terms of minimum and maximum exposure
allowed;

- embeds the asset and liabilities duration mismatches
permitted and potential mitigation actions that can be
enabled on the investment side.

Regarding specific asset classes such as (i) private equity,
(ii) alternative fixed income, (iii) hedge funds, (iv) deriva-
tives and structured products, the Group has mainly cen-

16 The “Prudent Person Principle” set out in Article 132 of Directive 2009/138/EC requires the company to only invest in assets and instruments whose risks can be identified,
measured, monitored, controlled and reported as well as taken into account in the company overall solvency needs. The adoption of this principle is ruled in the Group

Investment Governance Policy (GIGP).
