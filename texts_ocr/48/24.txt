The Human Safety Net

The Human Safety Net was launched in 2017 with a view - provided in internal guidelines - to focusing on

a smaller number of more similar and impactful initiatives for the communities where the Group operates
compared to the past. It aims to activate both financial and technical resources, as well as the network of
people and the skills of Generali’s employees and agents to meet shared goals, favouring contact with local

communities and making lasting change in the lives of recipients.

GENERALI Net

The Human Safety Net is active through three programmes with the shared mission
of freeing the potential of disadvantaged people to enable them to improve the living
conditions of their families and communities, by working alongside partners, like
local social businesses and non-governmental organizations.

Every country and business unit of the Group can choose to participate in one of
these three programmes, identifying, conducting due diligence on and selecting one
or more partners to directly manage activities with beneficiaries.

All of the activities and the results achieved are monitored through a measurement
system based on the London Benchmarking Group’s international standard.

In the coming three years, our ambition is to further extend The Human Safety

Net through active engagement of employees and agents, including volunteering
activities, as well as of customers and other third-party organizations that share its
approach and mission.
