The turnaround plan was accordingly supported by measures intended to
improve governance and promote social responsibility. For example, we
afforded greater autonomy to employees and simplified processes and lines
of reporting. The Human Safety Net, the awareness-raising and concrete
aid programme designed for the communities in which the Group carries
on business at global level, was extended to 18 countries. The climate
change strategy was also launched, to reduce direct and indirect impacts
on the environment, including through investments in ‘green’ projects

and disinvestments in the coal sector, promoting a shift towards more
sustainable practices on the part of stakeholders.

At 31 December 2018, Generali reached and surpassed its financial targets
of more than € 7 billion in cumulative net operating cash in the 2015-2018
period and an average operating return on equity of more than 13%. The
proposed 2019 dividend per share will enable Generali to reach and exceed
the target of more than € 5 billion in cumulative dividends in the 2015-2018
period.

On 21 November 2018, Generali presented Generali 2021, the new
2019-2021 strategic plan which aims to exploit the Group’s strengths to
accelerate its growth. Generali aspires to become a partner for life for

its customers, offering innovative and customized solutions relying on

its unequalled distribution network. Generali strives to be a leader in the
European insurance market for private individuals, professionals and SMEs,
while also developing a global and focused asset management platform and
taking advantage of opportunities in high-potential markets. Lastly, Generali
2021 is aligned with the Charter of Sustainability Commitments approved by
the Board of Directors in 2017.

We are certain that Generali will reach its goals for 2021. Our confidence
lies in the Group’s current position of strength demonstrated, inter alia, by
its leadership position in Europe, its undeniable path of success and the
clarity and robustness of the actions set forth in its new plan. Even more
importantly, our confidence is based on the talented team consisting of
roughly 70,000 employees and more than 150,000 agents and distributors
present all over the world, who with their energy, commitment, skill and
proud sense of belonging contribute to making the difference. Our sincerest
gratitude goes out to them and their families.
