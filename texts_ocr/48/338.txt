Manager (summary of 2017 targets and setting of 2018
targets) and the Audit Plan for 2018.

During the meeting of the Board of Directors on 14 March
2018, the BSA expressed a favourable opinion pursuant
to Art. 2389 of the Civil Code with respect to the proposal
to assign the newly issued shares to the Chief Executive
Officer (Group CEO) as part of the resolution to increase
the share capital as part of the 2015 LTI plan. Again with
reference to the Group CEO’s remuneration, on 29 June
2018 the Board of Statutory Auditors, expressed a fa-
vourable opinion of the Group CEO’s remuneration as
part of the LTI Plan 2018.

At the meeting of the Board of Directors on 30 July 2018,
pursuant to Art. 154-bis, paragraph 1, of the TUIF and
Art. 40, paragraph 2, of the Articles of Association, the
Board of Statutory Auditors also expressed a favourable
opinion on the proposal to appoint Cristiano Borean as
the new Manager in Charge of preparing the Company’s
Financial Reports.

During the 2018 financial year the BSA also regularly
commented on the Half-Year Reports on complaints pre-
pared by the Head of the Group Audit Function in com-
pliance with ISVAP Regulation no. 24 of 19 May 2008,
as amended. The reports did not highlight any particular
problems or organisational deficiencies. The BSA also
checked that the Company sent the reports and associ-
ated comments by the BSA promptly to IVASS.

11. Complaints pursuant to

Art. 2408 of the Civil Code.
Omissions, reprehensible actions
or irregularities found (points 5,

6 and 18 of Consob Notice no.
1025564/01)

The Board of Statutory Auditors received two communi-
cations pursuant to s. 2408 of the Civil Code during the
2018 financial year.

On 21 April 2018, the shareholder Tommaso Marino for-
warded a complaint pursuant to Art. 2408 of the Civil
Code, by which he requested the Board of Statutory
Auditors to verify the correctness and legitimacy of the
proxy issued by Generali PanEurope DAC (“GPE”), an
lrish company at the time wholly controlled by the Com-
pany, to attend the Shareholders’ Meeting of II Sole 24
Ore S.p.A. (“Il Sole 24 Ore”) held in Milan on 28 June
2017.

The Board of Statutory Auditors immediately involved the
competent corporate functions in order to carry out the
appropriate checks, discussing the outcomes reported

below, within the limits permitted by the regulatory re-
strictions on the protection of personal data.

The Board has found that ownership of the package of
shares of Il Sole 24 Ore in question was attributable to
GPE, and ascertained that the proxy to participate in the
Shareholders’ Meeting of Il Sole 24 Ore of 28 June 2017,
which did not provide for voting instructions, was duly
issued by GPE personnel with the necessary powers of
signature.

Finally, as regards the request for clarification from the
shareholder Marino on the potential attribution to the del-
egated subject of additional proxies by third parties in
addition to that conferred by GPE, these are profiles that
are beyond the legal scope of this Board of Statutory Au-
ditors, referring them, if applicable, to that of the control
body of II Sole 24 Ore.

On 27 December 2018, shareholder Tommaso Marino
sent a new complaint via certified email to the Company
pursuant to Art. 2408 of the Civil Code, addressed to the
Board of Statutory Auditors, in which he complained:

(i) to have requested the Assicurazioni Generali Foun-
dation The Human Safety Net (the “Foundation”)
to be able to view the financial statements and to
have been refused; and

(ii) the alleged failure to implement Art. 3 of the Articles
of Association of the Foundation, as it was, in his
opinion, almost totally lacking application due to
the alleged lack of support to “Social, health and
social-health assistance (with specific reference to
the disabled, ed.); charity, education, and training”
sectors.

With the support of the competent functions of the Com-
pany, the Board of Statutory Auditors therefore acquired
and examined the articles of association of the Founda-
tion, a disclosure on the composition of its administrative
and control bodies and the Foundation’s financial state-
ments approved by the Board of Directors on 14 Febru-
ary 2018.

In relation to the first reason for the complaint, the Board
of Statutory Auditors noted that the legislation applica-
ble to the Foundation does not provide any legal ob-
ligation to make the financial statements public. This
obligation can neither be inferred from the regulations
applicable to foundations (Presidential Decree No. 361
of 10 February 2000), nor from the fact that the founding
entity of the Foundation is a listed company such as the
Company.

Consequently, the decision of the Foundation not to
make its own financial statements available to the re-
questing party is to be considered legitimate.

In relation to the second ground of complaint, the Board
