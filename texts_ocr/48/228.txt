Reinsurance policy of the Group

With reference to the reinsurance policy, the table proves that the careful criteria for the selection of reinsurers adopted
by the Group over the past allowed Generali to have a significant presence of counterparties in rating classes of high

quality.

Insurance provisions ceded to reinsurers: breakdown by rating

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(€ million) 31/12/2018 31/12/2017
AAA 0 0
AA 1,945 2111
A 753 712
BBB 6 an
Non investment grade 0 1
No Rating 1,305 1,459
Total 4,009 4,294

In some circumstances, local regulations, market prac-
tice or specific types of business allow the Group to ben-
efit from mitigation of the related reinsurance credit risk
through deposits from reinsurers and/or letters of credit
as a guarantee on ceded reserves.

“No Rating” counterparties still remain; as in the past,
they also include a considerable amount of captive in-
surance companies of large industrial Groups that do
not qualify for any rating while showing a good financial
strength, companies that are no longer active in the re-
insurance market and not valued by the rating agencies,
but not necessarily less financially sound, companies that
are part of major insurance groups which benefit from
high rating but who have abandoned their reinsurance

activities, or, finally, of mutual and reinsurance pools.

“No Rating” is partially mitigated by the presence of
forms of guarantee such as cut through clause, parental
guarantee or other collateral.

Sensitivity analysis of life underwriting risk

The Generali Group makes its own analysis of sensitiv-
ity to insurance, not market, risks following the logic of
Solvency Il. For further information and the relevant nu-
merical evidence please refer to the Risk Report in the
Management Report.
