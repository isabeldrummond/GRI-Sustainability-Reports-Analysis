| We, Generali | Risk Report | Outlook | Statement

In line with the profitable growth and customer centric-
ity set in the strategy, non-motor development will con-
centrate on modular products designed to meet specific
needs and any new customer needs, providing innovative
services, prevention and assistance with the support of
digital tools and platforms. Growth in this segment will
also be supported by taking advantage of the opportu-
nities offered by new markets and moving forward with
distribution channel and partnership initiatives.

To handle these changes, the Group has rolled out a
number of initiatives to exploit the opportunities offered
by new technologies, for claims settlement as well as
time to market. These initiatives will continue to work
alongside a disciplined portfolio management approach
- pricing, selection and profitability of risks - and care-
ful assessments of customer requirements, which are
placed at the very centre of product development, so as
to create products that also take advantage of cross-sell-
ing opportunities.

As in the past, management of the P&C segment - due
to the level of capital absorption of these products - will
therefore continue to be a foundational principle for im-
plementing the Group’s strategy whose objective is to
become the leader in the European insurance market for
private individuals, professionals and SMEs.

In the Asset Management segment, actions will contin-
ue during 2019 to identify investment opportunities and
sources of income for all customers, while at the same
time managing risks. Consistent with the Group’s strat-
egy, growth will be achieved through the expansion of
the multi-boutique platform in order to increase the prod-
uct catalogue in terms of real assets and high convic-
tion strategies for customers and partners. This platform,
which is at present mainly based in Europe, aims to be-
come global with the increase in revenues and assets un-
der management (AUM) that will result from third-party
customers that do not fall within the scope of the Group’s
insurance policies.

The Group investments policy will continue to be based
on an asset allocation strategy aimed at consolidating
current returns and ensuring consistency with liabilities
to the policyholders.

The fixed-income investment strategy aims to diversify
the portfolio, both within the sector of government bonds
as well as in terms of corporate bonds, in order to guar-
antee adequate profitability to policyholders as well as
a satisfactory return on capital while maintaining a con-
trolled risk profile.

Alternative investments and investments in real assets
are considered appealing due to their contribution to
portfolio diversification and profitability. The Group is de-
veloping a multi-boutique insurance asset manager plat-
form to enhance the investment capacity in these market
sectors and better monitor their management in terms of
complexity as well as liquidity.

The increase in exposure to alternative investments will
be offset by reduced exposure to corporate bonds.

New direct investments in the real estate sector will be
primarily oriented towards the European market, while
investments in the United States and Asia will be made
selectively through funds.

Despite a rather challenging market context, the Group
achieved the targets established in the 2016-2018 stra-
tegic plan, highlighting solid profitability, focused on the
technical component and on cost efficiency, and offsetting
the effects of low interest rates. On 21 November 2018,
the Group presented to investors the new 2021 Generali
strategy, whose priority is to consolidate its leadership
in Europe and strengthen its position in high-potential
markets, financial optimisation, and innovation and the
digital transformation of the operating model. Thanks to
these initiatives, the Group is committed to achieving an
increase in earnings per share of between 6% and 8%
over the next three years and to offer greater returns to
shareholders with an average RoE of more than 11.5%
and a pay-out ratio between 55% and 65%.
