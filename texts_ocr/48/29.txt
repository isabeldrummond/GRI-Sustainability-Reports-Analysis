Uncertain financial and
macro-economic landscape

In 2018, global GDP is expected to increase to 3.6%.
The global macro-economic and political landscape was
affected by topics that aroused significant concern also
on the markets during the year, such as the budget law in
Italy, the escalation of trade friction (especially between
the USA and China), the worsening of the crisis in the
more fragile emerging markets and the protests of the
Yellow Vests in France.

Growth of real GDP of the Eurozone in 2018 is forecast
to be 1.9%, down compared to 2017 (2.5%). The
unemployment rate dropped to the minimum low of the
last decade, with an acceleration of wages in spite of
the inflation rate being low. The European Central Bank
(ECB) ended the quantitative easing during the year, but
will continue to reinvest bonds on maturity; the ECB’s
first increase in rates will be subordinate to the changes
in inflation. The major important topics for the financial

markets during 2018 within the Eurozone were Brexit
and developments on the Italian political scene. As
regards concern for the latter, the rating agencies Fitch
and Moody’s lowered their creditworthiness opinion
while alarm on Italy’s public finance pushed the ten-
year BTP-Bund spread up, and it closed 2018 at 253
bps.

In the USA, the tax reform kept up the confidence level;
growth of real GDP in 2018 should settle at 2.9%, up by
2.2% over 2017, while the unemployment rate fell to the
lowest level of the last 50 years. The Federal Reserve
raised the reference rates four times during 2018, and
additional increases are forecast for 2019 as well.

With reference to the insurance sector, the Life business
in Italy, France and Germany registered an upswing
following a difficult period, thanks not only to the sale of
unit-linked products, but also to recovery in traditional
policies that increased to rates higher than those of the
unit-linked ones. Income in the P&C market in the major
Eurozone countries improved, with particularly good
performance recorded in the health business.

 

 

 

Ww

and our management

Market expectations, the Group’s profitability targets and
the expectations of policyholders’ returns are the main
factors influencing the formulation of the investment
allocation strategy, in line with the Solvency II principles.
The regulatory system and the continued low interest in a
global context of growing uncertainty render it essential
to manage assets in a rigorous and careful manner that
is consistent with liabilities. Geographical diversification
and selective focus on alternative investments (private
equity and private debt) and real assets (real estate
assets and/or infrastructural assets, both direct and
indirect) are important factors in current investment
activities which aim to contain portfolio risks and sustain

current profitability. The creation of a multi-boutique
insurance asset manager platform is part of the strategy
to enhance the investment capacity in these market
sectors.

We are exposed to the market risks arising from the value
fluctuations of the investments and to the credit risks
linked to the risk of counterparties’ non-fulfilment as well
as to expansion of the credit spread. We are handling
these risks by following principles of sound and prudent
management, in line with the Prudent Person Principle
and with the Group Investment Governance Policy and
risk guidelines. We measure financial and credit risks
using the Group’s internal model, which offers us a better
representation of our risk profile.
