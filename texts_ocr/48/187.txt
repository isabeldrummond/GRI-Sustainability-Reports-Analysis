Segment reporting

Generali activities could be split in different lines of busi-

ness according to the products and services offered. In

particular, in accordance to IFRS 8, four main sectors of

activity have been defined:

- Non life segment, which includes insurance activities
performed in the non life business;

— Life segment, which includes insurance activities per-
formed in the life business;

- Asset management;

— Holding and other business segment.

Life segment

Activities of Life segment include saving and protection
business, both individual and for family, as well as unit
linked products with investment purposes and complex
plans for multinationals.

Non life segment

Activities of Non life segment include both motor and
non-motor businesses, among which motor third party
liabilities, casualty, accident and health. It includes also
more sophisticated covers for commercial and industrial
risks and complex plans for multinationals.

Investment vehicles and entities supporting the activities
of life companies are also reported in this segment.

Asset management

This segment operates as a supplier of products and ser-
vices both for the insurance companies of the Generali
Group and for third-party customers.

The products include equity and fixed-income funds, as
well as more alternative products. The objective pursued
by Asset Management is to identify investment oppor-
tunities and sources of income for all of its customers,
simultaneously managing risks.

The segment includes many companies that may special-
ise in institutional or retail clients, rather than on Group
insurance companies or on third-party customers, or on
products such as real assets, high conviction strategies
or more traditional solutions.

Holding and other business segment

This grouping is an heterogeneous pool of non insurance
assets and in particular it includes banking and asset
management activities, expenses regarding coordination
activities and interest expenses on the Group financial
debt, as well as other activities that the Group consid-
ers ancillary to the core insurance business. The hold-
ing expenses mainly include the holding and territorial
sub-holding direction expenses regarding coordination
activities, the expenses relating to the parent company
of stock option and stock grant plans as well interest ex-
penses on the Group financial debt.

Methods of disclosure presentation

According to IFRS 8, the disclosure regarding operating
segments of the Group is consistent with the evidence
reviewed periodically at the highest managerial level for
the purpose of making operational decisions about re-
sources to be allocated to the segments and assessment
of results.

Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of each segment
are presented in the tables below, prepared as defined by
the ISVAP Regulation No. 7 of 13 July 2007 and subse-
quent amendments.

Segment data derives from a separate consolidation of
the amounts of subsidiaries and associated companies
in each business segment, eliminating of the effects of
transactions between companies belonging to the same
segment and eliminating the carrying amount of the in-
vestments in subsidiaries of the same segment. The
reporting and control process implemented by Gen-
erali Group implies that assets, liabilities, income and
expenses of companies operating in different business
segments are allocated to each segment through spe-
cific segment reporting. Intra-group balances between
companies belonging to different business segments are
accounted for in the consolidation adjustments column
in order to reconcile segment information with consoli-
dated information.

In this context, Generali Group adopts a business ap-
proach on segment reporting, characterized by the fact
that some transactions between companies belonging to
different segments are eliminated within each segment.
