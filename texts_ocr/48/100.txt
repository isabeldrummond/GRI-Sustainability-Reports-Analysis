tween Group Own Funds (GOF) and Solvency Capital

The preliminary® Solvency Ratio as at 31 December 2018
is equal to 216%. The increase of 9 pps in respect to
previous year is mainly attributable to the significant con-
tribution of the normalised capital generation and to the
regulatory model changes and merger & acquisition dis-
posal operations of the period, that exceed the negative
economic variance deriving from financial markets and
the foreseeable dividend of the year.

SCR and Minimum Consolidated Group SCR (MCR) data
hereby reported are based on a preliminary estimate.

1. Group Own Funds

Group Own Funds are calculated as the sum of consol-
idated Basic Own Funds related to insurance undertak-
ings and other entities not subject to other solvency sec-
toral rules and Own Funds attributable to non-insurance
entities, defined according to their sectoral regulatory
regimes.

Basic Own Funds are calculated as the sum of:
— the excess of assets over liabilities following Solvency
Il valuation;

- plus subordinated debt eligible in Basic Own Funds;

— less foreseeable dividends;

— plus additional Own Funds related to unrealised capital
gains from French pension activities arising from the
application of the IORP’ transitory regime®;

— less deductions for participations in sectoral entities;

— less deductions for regulatory filters applied to non-avail-
able items at Group level, restricted Own Funds items
and shares of the parent company.

On the basis of IVASS Provvedimento n. 53, 2016, the SCR and MCR calculations to be disclosed in the Annual Report can rely on a preliminary estimate. More details on the

Solvency Ratio will be disclosed in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report.
IORP stands for Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provisions.

These additional Own Funds are authorised by Supervisor for the years between 2016 and 2022, a period during which the proportion of the eligible unrealised capital gains will

decrease gradually.
