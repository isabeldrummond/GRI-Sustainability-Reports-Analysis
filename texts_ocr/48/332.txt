As part of its supervisory activity over the ICRMS, the
Board of Statutory Auditors paid specific attention to
matters of IT security. During the 2018 financial year, a
new Group document framework was defined for the
management of Cyber-Security and Data-Protection,
and specific procedures have been prepared for the
management of IT incidents.

The Board of Statutory Auditors also continued to moni-
tor the implementation of the plan to mitigate money
laundering and terrorist financing risks as defined by
the Board of Directors in December 2017, following the
self-assessment process conducted during the year
as based on the specific methodologies indicated by
IVASS.

Also during the 2018 financial year, the Board of Statu-
tory Auditors received updates on the external quality as-
sessment conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers on the
Group Audit Function, both on the Company and certain
Group companies. This analysis highlighted the general
compliance of the Function with international standards
for the professional practice of internal auditing, and
identified some areas of further refinement, for which an
action plan has already been defined.

With reference to areas that will be the subject of spe-
cific interventions already planned by the Fundamental
Functions, the following is noted in view of the process
of constant reinforcement and continuous improve-
ment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Group
system:

— in the IT area, and with particular regard to aspects of
Cyber-Security and Data Protection, activities have
been scheduled to verify the effective implementation
of the new regulatory framework and the implementa-
tion by individual Group companies of the related pro-
cedural structure for IT security management;

— aseries of interventions were planned by the four Fun-
damental Functions to support the internal control sys-
tem on branches, and in particular that located in the
UK, in view of potential operational difficulties deriving
from Brexit;

— in light of legislative and regulatory developments (anti-
money laundering, privacy and customer protection,
