The cost of equity (Ke) for each entity is extrapolated
based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for-
mula.

In detail:

— the risk free rate was defined as the average value -
observed during the last three months of 2018 of the
10-years government bond of the reference country of
operation of the CGU, on which the goodwill has been
allocated;

— the Beta coefficient was determined based on a ho-
mogeneous basket of securities of the non-life and life
insurance sectors, which was compared to market in-
dexes. The observation period was 5 years with weekly
frequency;

— the market risk premium amounts to 5.5% for all
Group’s CGUs.

All CGUs passed the impairment test, being their re-
coverable amounts higher than their carrying amounts.
Furthermore a sensitivity analysis was performed on the
results changing the cost of own capital of the company
(Ke) (+/-1%) and the perpetual growth rate of distributa-
ble future cash flows (g) (+/-1%) and for Non-life segment
also for the main non-financial assumptions. This sensi-
tivity did not highlight any negative difference between
the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.
