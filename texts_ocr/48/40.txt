The fixed component remunerates the role held and responsibilities assigned, also considering the experience and
skills required, as well as the quality of the contribution made in terms of achieving business results.

The annual variable remuneration is based on an incentive system, whereby a cash bonus ranging from 0% to 200%

of the individual target baseline can be accrued depending on:

— the Group funding, connected with results achieved in terms of Group operating result and adjusted net profit as
well as the surpassing of a minimum Regulatory Solvency Ratio level;

- the achievement of the objectives defined in the individual balanced scorecards, which establish from 5 to 7 objecti-
ves at Group, Region, country, business/function and individual level - as appropriate - based on the following per-
spectives:

An internal path valuing and focusing on sustainability topics has been enhanced since 2018 with the aim of embedding
key environmental, social and governance (ESG) drivers in the balanced scorecards of the Group’s top management.
Specifically, the balanced scorecards of the top managers in Investment and Insurance functions include specific
sustainability KPls, focused on updating the responsible investment strategy on the most relevant topics (e.g. fossil
fuels and tobacco) and implementing a responsible underwriting policy, respectively.

The deferred variable remuneration is built on a multi-year plan based on Assicurazioni Generali shares and annually

approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting. The maximum potential bonus to be disbursed in shares amounts to 175%

of the fixed remuneration of the participants (this percentage is 250% for the Managing Director/Group CEO). Here

the features of the plan are:

— it is paid out over a period of 6 years and is linked with specific Group performance targets (Return on Equity and
relative total shareholder return) and the surpassing of a minimum Regulatory Solvency Ratio level;

- it is based on a three-year performance period and additional sale-restriction periods (i.e. minimum holding) on
granted shares up to two years.

Benefits consist of a supplementary pension and healthcare assistance for employees and their families, in addition
to acompany car and further benefits, including some linked to domestic or international travel (e.g. accommodation
expenses, travel and education for children), in line with market practices.
