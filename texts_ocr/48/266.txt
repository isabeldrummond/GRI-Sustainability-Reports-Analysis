found to be non-lasting or ineffective as a result of wilful
misconduct or gross negligence.

Individual tranches of shares are only granted at the end
of the performance period and, therefore, at the end of
the three years, after verifying the degree to which the
targets have been achieved in the third year (i.e. assess-
ment by the Board of Directors on the actual achieve-
ment of the targets set, considered both on an annual
and overall 3-year basis) and as long as there continues
to be an employment/ director relationship in place with
the Company or with other companies of the Group as
at the grant date. Consequently, save for extraordinary
situations as specifically envisaged by the plan rules,
and unless otherwise decided by the delegated bodies,
any case of termination of the employment/director rela-
tionship automatically entails forfeiture of the right to be
granted shares.

As regards the holding period, in line with investors re-
quests. at the grant date, 50% of the shares are imme-
diately available (to allow the participants to pay the tax
charges connected with the grant), the remaining 50%
is subject to a two year lock-up period; subject to the
requirement for the directors that participate the plan to
maintain a suitable number of shares assigned until term
of the office in course at the expiry of the lock-up.

In line with the LTI plans 2015 and 2016, a dividend
equivalent mechanism has been introduced on the basis
of the dividends distributed during the three-year per-
formance period. In particular, should the shareholders’
meeting resolve upon the distribution of dividends in fa-
vour of the shareholders during the three-year reference
period, at the expiry of such three-year reference period,
an additional number of shares determined in relation to
the overall dividends distributed during the three-year
reference period will be assigned in favour of the benefi-
ciaries. The additional number of shares thus determined
shall be assigned simultaneously and in relation with the
other shares assigned in favour of each beneficiary, sub-
ject to the same restrictions (holding period) mentioned
above and determined considering the shares’ value at
the assignment of the plan, to be calculated as the av-
erage price of the share in the three months prior to the
meeting of the Board of Directors called to resolve on the
draft statutory financial statements of the Parent Compa-
ny and the consolidated financial statements for the year
previous to the year of the Plan start.

The maximum number of shares that can be granted is
11,500,000, accounting for 0.74% of the current share
capital.

In line with the previous plans, the 2018 LTI plan can be
treated as an equity-settled share-based payment falling
under IFRS 2 scope, which provides a grant date meas-
urement model seeking to capture the value of the contin-
gent right to shares promised at grant date, to the extent
that that promises becomes an entitlement of the counter-
party, rather than the value of any shares finally delivered.

The condition related to rfSR configures as a market
condition, other conditions mentioned above are consid-
ered whether as performance or as service condition.

The fair value of the right to receive free shares related
to the market condition is estimated at grant date using
statistic model which estimates the statistically probable
positioning of Group TSR respect to peer group identified
in the STOXX Euro Insurance Index.

As regards 2014 plans, the performance level to be as-
sessed was determined by the cross-comparison of
ranges of ROE and relative TSR; for each tranche was
calculated a fair value for each of the possible RoE inter-
vals according to the reference matrix for the cross-com-
parison of ranges of ROE and relative TSR.

In order to assess the cumulative cost of the individual
plans, for each tranche, the fair value related to the most
probable RoE outcome was multiplied by the number of
shares that can be assigned based on satisfaction of the
vesting conditions. This cost has been allocated over a
period of maturity of 3 years (vesting period), with a cor-
responding increase in equity.

In line with the calculation method applied from 2015,
described above and based on an independent assess-
ment of the levels of achievement on the Group’s finan-
cial indicators, the cost of the plans 2016, 2017 and 2018
was determined by separating the component connect-
ed to the relative TSR to the one linked to the ROE.

The evaluation of the bonus right linked to market con-
dition is made by multiplying the fair value of assignable
shares (equal to the market price at grant date) with the
determined pay-out by applying the linear interpolation
of the probable position of rTSR estimated using a sta-
tistical model. The linear interpolation method is applied
to a range between the maximum pay-out, recognized in
the case of the TSR positioning at the first place, and a
pay-out zero in the case where the TSR is in the last posi-
tion with respect to selected peer or has a negative value.
