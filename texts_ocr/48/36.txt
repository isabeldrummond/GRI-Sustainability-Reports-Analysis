In 2016, we launched the Shareholders’ Meeting Extended Inclusion program to facilitate participation in the Shareholders’ N FS
Meeting to those with motor and sensory disability: some dedicated services are provided to overcome any physical,
communication and sensory barriers, like simultaneous translation into many languages, sign language and captioning in

Italian, reception and check-in, as well as professional medical assistance.

The Board of Directors has structured its own organization - even through the establishment of special Board
Committees - in a manner that meets the need to define strategic planning in line with the Group’s purpose, values and
culture and, at the same time, monitors the pursuit of this strategy with a view to the sustainable value creation over
the medium to long term. Our integrated governance also leverages the varied and in-depth professional skills present
in the Board and ensures effective oversight of management's activities.
