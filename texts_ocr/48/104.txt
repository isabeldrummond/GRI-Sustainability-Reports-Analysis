To define MCR coverage, stricter Own Fund eligibility rules are applied compared to the ones previously used for the
SCR". In the following table, the split by tiers of the Own Funds covering the MCR is reported:

Group Partial Internal Model (Group
PIM)

Generali deems the Group PIM to be the most appropri-
ate way of assessing the Group SCR. It represents the
best way of capturing the risk profile of the entire Group
and of the Legal Entities in scope in terms of granularity,
calibration and correlation of the various risk factors.

The Group PIM is structured around a Risk Map, which
contains all quantifiable risks that Generali Group has
identified as relevant to its business, allowing for the cal-
culation of the SCR at single risk level and at higher ag-
gregation levels.

1. Group PIM Methodology

In implementing the PIM, the Group has adopted the so-
called Monte-Carlo approach with “proxy functions” to
determine the Probability Distribution Forecast (PDF) of
the changes in the Basic Own Funds over a 1-year ho-
rizon.

The Own Funds probability distribution allows to deter-
mine the potential losses at any percentile for risks in
scope and, in particular, the SCR corresponding to the
99.5th percentile. The risk measure applied is the VaR
(Value at Risk). Monte-Carlo methods are used in the in-
dustry to obtain sound numerical results using the em-
bedded characteristics of repeated random sampling
to simulate the more complex real-world events. Proxy
functions are mathematical functions that mimic the in-
teraction between risk drivers and insurance portfolios to
obtain the most reliable results.

The calibration procedure involves quantitative and qual-
itative aspects. The aggregation process uses advanced
mathematical techniques following market best practic-
es. Dependencies among risks are defined through the
use of a so called ‘Copula approach’ that simulates the
interaction between several risk drivers (elements that
mimic the underlying sources of risk) throughout the
simulations generated by the Monte-Carlo stochastic
method.

11 The amounts of Tier 2 and Tier 3 items eligible to cover the MCR are subject to stricter quantitative limits. The eligible amount of Tier 1 items shall be at least 80% of the MCR;
the same limitation on subordinated liabilities and preference shares is set. The eligible amounts of Tier 2 items shall not exceed 20% of the MCR. No Tier 3 items are allowed

to cover the Minimum Capital Requirement. No capital from sectoral is considered

12 Tier 1 includes also available capital of sectoral entities and the unrealised gains and losses on French Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP) business as
