The combined ratio of the Group stood at 93.0% (+0.1
pps compared to 31 December 2017), the best amongst
peers in the market. The change was entirely attributable
to the trend in the expense ratio.

With reference to the total loss ratio, which remained
stable at 65.1%, the current year non-catastrophe loss
ratio increased by 0.4 pps due to the higher impact of
the aforementioned large man-made claims of 0.6 pps,
mainly concentrated in the Global Corporate & Commer-
cial lines. The impact from natural catastrophe claims
was 1.7% (2.1% at 31 December 2017). The prior year
loss ratio remained stable at -5.6%. As usual, the Group
maintained its prudent reserving approach, confirmed by
the reserving ratio of 148%.

With regard to the main countries of operation, the com-
bined ratio was excellent in Italy, equal to 91.0% (+0.9
pps entirely attributable to the increase in the expense ra-
tio), and Germany (92.7%; +0.2 pps), inclusive of 2.7 pps
of natural catastrophe claims for the various storms that
hit the country, partially offset by the positive trend of the
current year loss ratio. The CoR of France (99.9%; +1.4
Pps) was also impacted by 2.6 pps, deriving from storms
and floods. The combined ratio of ACEER improved to

88.1%, thanks also to the absence of natural catastrophe
claims. The CoR of Americas and Southern Europe also
improved to 101.6%: last year, in Argentina there was
an adjustment of the local reserve for some classes of
claims following the inflationary dynamics observed dur-
ing the period.

Acquisition and administration costs related to insurance
business amounted € 5,468 million (€ 5,419 million at 31
December 2017). In detail, acquisition costs increased to
€ 4,437 million (+2.2%), reflecting the increase in costs
resulting from the growth in premiums observed in Cen-
tral and Eastern European countries, in France and in Eu-
rop Assistance, as well as that in Italy to support non-mo-
tor premiums. The ratio of acquisition costs to net earned
premiums therefore increased from 22.3% to 22.6%.
Administration costs rose from € 1,076 million to € 1,030
million, showing a drop of 4.2% due mainly to the reduc-
tion observed in Germany, as a result of efficiency from
the SSYtL transformation program, and Americas. The
ratio of administration costs to net earned premiums was
down slightly at 5.3% (-0.3 pps).

Therefore, the expense ratio stood at 27.9% (27.8% at 31
December 2017).
