date of a company differs from that of the Parent Com-
pany, the former prepares interim financial statements
at 31 December of each financial year;

— All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income,
expenses and cash flows relating to transactions be-
tween members of the Group are eliminated in full on
consolidation process (intra-group losses are eliminat-
ed, except to the extent that the underlying asset is
impaired);

— the carrying amount of the Parent Company’s invest-
ment in each subsidiary and the Parent Company’s
portion of equity of each subsidiary are eliminated at
the date of acquisition;

— Profit or loss and each component of other comprehen-
sive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders
of the Parent of the Group and to the non-controlling
interests, even if this results in the non-controlling in-
terests having a deficit balance. The non-controlling
interests, together with their share of profit are shown
as separate items.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, with-
out a change of control, is accounted for as an equity
transaction. Consequently, no additional goodwill or
badwill is recognized.

lf the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecog-
nizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities,
non-controlling interest and other components of equity
while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or
loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value.

Investment funds managed by the Group in which the
Group holds an interest and that are not managed in the
primary interest of the policyholders are consolidated
based on the substance of the economic relationship
and if whether the conditions of control stated by IFRS
10 are satisfied. On consolidation of an investment fund,
a liability is recognized to the extent that the Group is
legally obliged to buy back participations held by third
parties. Where this is not the case, other participations
held by third parties are presented as non-controlling in-
terests in equity.

Business combination and goodwill

Business combinations are acquisitions of assets and
liabilities that constitutes a business and are account-
ed for applying the so-called acquisition method The
acquisition cost is measured as the sum of the con-

sideration transferred measured at its acquisition date
fair value, including contingent consideration, liabilities
assumed towards the previous owners, and the amount
of any non-conirolling interests. For each business
combination, the Group elects whether to measure the
non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or
at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable
net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as
incurred and included in administrative expenses.

If in a business combination achieved in stages, the ac-
quirer’s previously held equity interests in the acquire is
re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any
resulting gain or loss recognized in profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred or re-
ceived by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at
the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classi-
fied as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument
and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair val-
ue with changes in fair value recognised either in either
profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive
income. If the contingent consideration is not within
the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with
the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration that is
classified as equity is not re-measured and subsequent
settlement is accounted for within equity.

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a busi-
ness combination are initially recognized at fair value
at the acquisition date. Goodwill is initially measured at
cost being the excess of the aggregate acquisition cost
over the net value of the identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities assumed is accounted for as goodwill. If
the impairment test lead to the result that theacquisition
cost is less than the fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, the difference is recognised in
the profit and loss account.

Investments in associates and joint
ventures

The investments in associates and joint ventures are
consolidated trough the equity method.

An associate is an entity over which the investor has sig-
nificant influence. Significant influence is the power to
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions
of the investee but is not control or joint control over
