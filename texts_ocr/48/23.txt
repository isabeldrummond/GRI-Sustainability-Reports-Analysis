| 22 | Generali Group Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

As regards the process of engagement of counterparties associated with the coal sector in countries which are
highly dependent on coal, in line with the Just Transition principles, we involved the 6 companies to which the
Group has exposure, which are part of the 120 companies identified as Top Coal Plant Developers by the Urgewald
organization and currently taken as a reference. We are evaluating their transition plans to decide whether to
continue or suspend the business.

t 107,394 co e® We are also committed to reducing our direct impacts through the responsible
y 2 management of the relevant activities. In 2014, we defined an objective for reducing
__(13.8% vs base year 2013) _ our Carbon Footprint by 20% within 2020 (base year 2013).

In 2018, purchased renewable energy was equal to 88% of the total acquired energy.

Insofar as our public commitment goes, in 2018 we declared our support for the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and launched an internal process for the management of key aspects and the
development of a reporting framework. We also participate in the UNEP FI Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI)
work group on the implementation of the TCFD Recommendations by insurers and the Investor Leadership Network,
promoted as part of the G7 Investor Global Initiatives, in which we also dig deep into the topic of climate change
with the main financial sector operators.

The Group’s new strategy features a considerable sustainability component amongst its key initiatives:

 

Responsible consumers

Generali will create a distinctive offer dedicated to responsible consumers who want to have a positive impact
on the environment and society. The offer will include social and green products and sustainable investments to
meet the expectations and satisfy the consumption choices of the consumers of today and tomorrow. We are
committed to promoting responsible behaviours by engaging and training our sales channels.

We have already identified specific products which, given the type of customer or due to their promotion of
responsible behaviours or based on provided coverage, meet specific social and environmental needs.
