tinued the growth in place during the year, standing at

The net cash inflows were amongst the highest levels in
the market, reaching € 11,369 million. The 5.2% growth,
equal to € 492 million, reflected the trend of France
(+ € 612 million), which benefited from the rising premi-
ums and lower surrenders compared to 2017, to which
were added those of Asia (+ € 487 million), which re-
ceived a further boost from the drop in surrenders in the
quarter, and Germany (+ € 231 million) thanks to both the
improvement in premiums and lower surrenders. Italy
(- € 934 million) was affected by higher payments deriving
from surrenders.

The new business in terms of present value of new busi-
ness premiums (PVNBP) amounted to € 43,202 million,
showing a decline of 1.8%.

With reference to the business lines, the protection
business increased by 2.1% in all the Group’s areas of

operations, with the exception of Germany. Unit-linked
business decreased (-1.5%, due to the decrease in Italy
and Germany) as did that of savings products (-3.7%),
in line with the Group’s strategy aimed at reducing the
guaranteed business.

The profitability of new business (margin on PVNBP) im-
proved by 0.26 pps, to 4.35% (4.01% at 31 December
2017), following the increase in profitability of both pro-
tection products (+0.51 pps), mainly thanks to the im-
provement in France and Spain, and savings products
(+0.29 pps), positively influenced by the continued reduc-
tion of financial guarantees and the improvement in the
economic environment.

As a consequence of the actions described above, the
new business value (NBV) increased by 4.3% and stood
at € 1,877 million (€ 1,820 million at 31 December 2017).
