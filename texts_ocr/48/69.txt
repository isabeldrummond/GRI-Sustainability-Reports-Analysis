| 68 | Generali Group Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

Generali Global Infrastructure (GGI) was launched at the beginning of the year. It is a
platform that employs internal know-how and also creates partnerships to invest in
infrastructure debt across a wide geographical and sectorial investment scope and
develop a range of products and solutions for investors.

Other initiatives of the multi-boutiques strategy were also launched during 2018, such
as Aperture Investors, an innovative asset management company based on a revenue
model that is radically different from what is found on the market. The company debits
basic commissions, such as those of the Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), which can
increase only when the managers go past the reference benchmarks. The acquisition
of CM Investment Solutions Limited (CMISL) from Bank of America Merrill Lynch was
announced in December. The acknowledged leader in developing alternative UCITS
(Undertakings for the Collective Investment of Transferable Securities) strategies, with
an international clientele and that is enjoying exuberant growth, CMISL will further
support Generali’s offer capacities and distribution to customers and distribution
partners. Furthermore, Generali signed an agreement with the German group Union
Asset Management Holding AG to acquire 100% of the Polish asset management
company Union Investments TFI S.A, one of the largest asset management companies
in Poland, in order to bolster its positioning in Central-Eastern Europe. Also during
2018 the Sycomore Asset Management partnership proposal was announced. This
represents one more stage in the multi-boutique strategy and highlights Generali’s
commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters and socially
responsible investment (SRI). Authorisation of the competent supervisory and antitrust
authorities for this latter partnership have been received in the first decade of February
2019, closing the acquisition process of the company.

The business unit operates in the three areas depicted by its name:

1. Investment Management: implementation of the Asset Liability Management (ALM)
and Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) models for the Group Insurance Companies;

2. Asset Management: asset management for the most part addressed to insurance
customers, with its customer base expanded to comprise external customers, both
institutional (such as pension funds and foundations) and retail;

3. Wealth Management: financial planning and asset protection services for the Private
customers, mainly offered through the Banca Generali Group.

The operating result of the Investments, Asset & Wealth Management business unit
grew by 13%, from € 468 million to € 527 million in 2018. This positive figure was mainly
driven by Asset Management Europe, which increased its operating result by about
€ 87 million compared to last year.

In this context, the contribution provided by Wealth Management was negative for about
€ 9 million, due to the high volatility that characterized financial markets in 2018 and
which affected performance fees, only partially offset by other recurring commissions.
