consolidated financial liabilities related to specific bal-
ance sheet items from the consolidated financial state-
ments. This category also includes liabilities stated by
the insurance companies against investment contracts

ing to the Group;

— liabilities linked to financing activities, including the
other consolidated financial liabilities, among which
subordinated liabilities, bonds issued and other loans
obtained. This category includes, for example, liabilities
incurred in connection with a purchase of controlling

Other non-subordinated liabilities linked to financing activities 425 457

Total 38,540 38,015

The reduction in the Group’s liabilities linked to financing
activities was mainly due to the redemption of two sub-
ordinated bonds issued in 2008 for a nominal amount of
€ 250 million through the exercise of the early redemption
option in November and December 2018.

The liabilities linked to operating activities posted an in-
crease due mainly to the increase in the deposits of the
Group banks.

Interest expenses on total liabilities were detailed below:

The weighted average cost of liabilities linked to financing
activities at 31 December 2018 stood at 5.66%, down
from 5.71% at 31 December 2017. The weighted aver-
age cost reflects the annualized cost of financial debt,

and the related transactions of currency and interest rate
hedging.
