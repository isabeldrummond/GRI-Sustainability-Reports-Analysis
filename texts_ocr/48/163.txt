| 162 | Generali Group

The Generali Group decided to apply the deferral ap-
proach, appropriate in addressing the issues arising from
the application of IFRS 9 before the new insurance con-
tracts standard.

The adoption of the overlay approach - the alternative
provided by the amendment, which allows the simulta-
neous application of IAS 39 and IFRS 9, would have in
effect implied incremental costs due to reconciliation and
alignment, compared to costs arising from the first appli-
cation of IFRS 9.

The quantitative criteria for the application of the deferral
and the disclosures required to the entities that postpone
the application of IFRS 9 are included in the section “Dis-
closures about the temporary exemption from IFRS 9”.

Standard implementation

The implementation of IFRS 9 aims to by the Group aims
to ensure the correct and consistent application of the
new accounting standard in conjunction with the entry into
force of IFRS 17, the future standard on insurance con-
tracts. The Group expects impacts that may be material
with reference to the classification and measurement of
financial instruments and consisting of a larger part of the
portfolio of financial investments measured at fair value
through profit or loss. With reference to impairment, the
Group assessed that the Expected Credit Losses model
should lead to less relevant impacts on the financial state-
ments considering the high creditworthiness of the Group
debt portfolio.

IFRS 17 - Insurance contracts

On 18 May 2017 the IASB published IFRS 17 “Insurance
Contracts”, which substitutes the current IFRS 4 - In-
surance Contracts. The new standard. proposes a new
measurement model for insurance contracts , structured
on a Building Block Approach based on the expected
value of future cash flows, weighted by the probability
of occurrence, on a risk adjustment and on a margin for
the services provided within the contract (“contractual
service margin”). A simplified approach (“Premium Allo-
cation Approach”) is permitted if the coverage period of
the contract is less than one year, or if the model used
for assessment provides a reasonable approximation
compared to the building block approach. The variable
fee approach (VFA) was also introduced, an alternative
model to the Building Block Approach which applies in
particular to profit-sharing contracts, for which the scope
of application is very significant for the Group in consider-

ation of the current portfolio mix. The standard, compared
to what initially stated and thanks to the ongoing IASB
amendment process, will be effective on 1 January 2022
and, substantially, will allow to extend the implementation
period of 12 months more.

In the second half of 2017 the IASB set up the Transi-
tion Resource Group (TRG) for IFRS 17 “Insurance Con-
tracts”, a public forum, similar in form to those for IFRS
15 Revenue from contracts with customers, and for IFRS
9 Financial Instruments relating to impairment, which has
the purpose of discussing the implementation issues that
emerged and supporting the board in defining what ac-
tions may be taken to address such critical issues.

Taking into account some concerns raised by stakehold-
ers regarding several requirements of IFRS 17, the IASB
started a process to consider potential amendments to
the current formulation of the standard based on specif-
ic requirements which aim to protect the integrity of the
information provided, avoiding the introduction of further
criticalities as well as the interruption of the implementa-
tion processes in progress. Within this process the IASB
has tentatively decided to defer the date of first applica-
tion to the 1 January 2022 and, coherently, to align the
date of application of IFRS 9 for entities which opted for
the postponed application of IFRS 9. The Group is mon-
itoring the IASB re-deliberation process, continuing the
implementation plan of the standard.

The Group expects a radical change in the financial state-
ments disclosure both in terms of insurance liabilities
evaluation, presentation of economic performance and
notes. Considering the extraordinary magnitude of the
new requirements introduced by the standard, very signif-
icant impacts also in terms of resources, processes and
information systems supporting the evaluation framework
are expected.

Due to the very significant impacts on financial informa-
tion and operating model of the companies, the Group
started a finance transformation program at global level.
The program involves different functions at central and
local level and aims to implement IFRS 9 and IFRS 17
consistently at Group level.

IFRS 16 —- Leases

On 13 January 2016 IFRS 16 “Leases” was published.
The new standard introduces new requirements for rec-
ognition, presentation in the financial statements and
disclosure of leases.
