Receivables on premiums written in course of collection
and receivables from intermediates and brokers, co-in-
surers and reinsurers are included in this item. They are
accounted for at their fair value at acquisition date and
subsequently at their presumed recoverable amounts.

Other receivables

This item includes all other receivables, which do not
have an insurance or tax nature. They are accounted for
at fair value at recognition and subsequently at their pre-
sumed recoverable amounts.

Other assets

Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held
for sale, deferred acquisition costs, tax receivables, de-
ferred tax assets, and other assets are classified in this
item.

Non-current assets or disposal groups
classified as held for sale

This item comprises non-current assets or disposal
groups classified as held for sale under IFRS 5. Non-cur-
rent assets and disposal groups are classified as held for
sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing
use. The criteria for held for sale classification is regard-
ed as met only when the sale is highly probable and the
asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale
in its present condition. Management must be commit-
ted to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the
date of classification.

They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount
and fair value less costs to sell.

Discontinued operations are excluded from the results
of continuing operations and are presented as a single
amount in profit or loss after tax from discontinued oper-
ations in the income statement.

quirements of IFRS 4, the Group continued to apply ac-

counting policies prior to the transition to international
accounting principles. In this item acquisition costs paid
before the subscription of multi-year contracts to amor-
tize within the duration of the contracts are included.

Deferred tax assets

Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible tempo-
rary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities and the corresponding amounts recognized
for tax purposes.

In the presence of tax losses carried forward or unused
tax credits, deferred tax assets are recognized to the ex-
tent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the aforementioned tax losses or
unused tax credits.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside prof-
it or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred
tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying
transaction either in other comprehensive income or di-
rectly in equity.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are off-
set if a legally enforceable right exists to offset current
tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the
deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the
same taxation authority.

Deferred tax assets are measured at the tax rates that are
expected to be applied in the year when the asset is real-
ized, based on information available at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are not recognized in the following

cases provided in paragraph 24 of IAS 12:

— when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a busi-
ness combination and, at the time of the transaction,
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit
or loss

- in respect of deductible temporary differences associ-
ated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and
interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are rec-
ognised only to the extent that it is probable that the
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable
future and taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary differences can be utilized.

- for all deductible temporary differences between the
carrying amount of assets or liabilities and their tax
