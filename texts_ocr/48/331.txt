nal control and risk management policies of the Group,
which apply to all companies.
The ICRMS was defined in accordance with the terms
of Solvency Il, including delegated acts and guidelines
issued on the subject by EIOPA, and with the legislative
and regulatory provisions transposed at a national level.
Following the issue by the Regulator of authorisation to
use a “Partial Internal Model” (PIM) to calculate the Sol-
vency Capital Requirement (SCR) as required by Solven-
cy Il, the Group is allowed to use the PIM to determine
the SCR of the Group and the main Business Units for
the Italian, German, French and Czech companies. For
further details, see the Group Risk Report.

During 2018, in compliance with Solvency Il, the Group

updated or defined the related internal group policies

aimed at pursuing the following objectives:

- to standardise the ICRMS, establishing the roles and
responsibilities of corporate structures to which the
Fundamental Functions are entrusted;

- establishing the processes associated with the man-
agement of specific risks (investment, underwriting,
concentration and operational risks) and the main busi-
ness processes (including capital management, the as-
set liability management process and the product ap-
proval process).

Although the Company is no longer among the systemic
entities, Group controls were also confirmed in 2018
with the updating of the Systemic Risk Management
Plan, Liquidity Risk Management Plan and Recovery
Plan, the latter also in light of the recent provisions of
IVASS Regulation no. 38/2018 on reinforced emergency
plans.

The Company monitored legislative developments dur-
ing the year, activated compliance-checking plans and
continued its ongoing reinforcement of the procedural
structure, as described in the parent company’s Risk
Report, Annual Integrated Report, and Consolidated Fi-
nancial Statements 2018. The Internal Control and Risk
Management System policies are also adopted by the
main subsidiaries, having regard to the specific legisla-
tion in each country in which the Group operates, and
any special features of the business. These policies are
continuously updated.

During 2018, based on the results of the monitoring of
the Group Compliance Function, the Group has adapted
to new significant regulations, including the European
Directive on Insurance Distribution (and related local im-
plementing legislation) and the European Regulation on
Personal Data Protection (GDPR).

IVASS Regulation no. 38/2018 was issued on 3 July 2018,

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

which repealed the previous IVASS Regulation no. 20 of
26 March 2008. The latter remained in force until the pub-
lication of new secondary legislation, and was applicable
for the first part of the financial year in question.

IVASS Regulation no. 38/2018, involved a revision of the
corporate governance system of insurance companies:
the Company promptly initiated a gap analysis between
the governance structure, the most important Group
corporate controls and processes, and the model out-
lined by the aforementioned Regulation. Consequently,
the relative implementation activities and appropriate
coordination methods were identified amongst the vari-
ous functions to which the individual actions have been
delegated.

The interventions on the role of the Chairman and the
Board Committees, the organisational structure of the
Fundamental Functions and the effective and efficient
performance of their respective functions, as well as the
updating of internal regulations of the Board of Directors
and Committees were immediately implemented, and
approved by the Board of Directors at the meeting of 12
December 2018. On 30 January 2019, the Board of Di-
rectors also approved some amendments to the Articles
of Association for compliance with the aforementioned
IVASS Regulation no. 38/2018 for aspects relative to the
provisions of the articles of association on the compo-
sition of the Executive Committee, which was not insti-
tuted by the Company.

The other implementation activities, for which the transi-
tional provision of Art. 95, paragraph 1, of IVASS Regula-
tion n. 38/2018 requires the adjustment by 31 December
2019 and the adoption of the appropriate resolutions
within the first half of 2019, have been almost completely
completed within the first quarter of the current year. The
remaining activities are being finalised, and are expected
to be completed within the first half of 2019, in full com-
pliance with the regulatory deadline.

The BSA has constantly monitored the activities of
adapting the governance structure of the Company and
Group to IVASS Regulation n. 38/2018, receiving periodic
information from the company functions involved, and
formulating recommendations and suggestions where
deemed appropriate.

In the context of constant development and reinforce-
ment of controls, in accordance with the applicable in-
dustry regulations, the Board of Statutory Auditors has
constantly monitored the adequacy of the ICRMS of the
Company and its Group, verifying their effective opera-
tion. In particular, in taking into account the provisions of
Art. 74 of IVASS Regulation n. 38/2018 recently entered
into force, the BSA has:
