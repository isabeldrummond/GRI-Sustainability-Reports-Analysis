2017-2026 Framework Loyalty Programme for
the Network

The 2017-2026 Framework Loyalty Programme for the
Network was approved by the Board of Directors on 21
March 2017 and ratified by the General Shareholders’
Meeting on 20 April 2017.

The Framework Loyalty Programme is divided into eight
annual individual plans, all set to expire on 31 December
2026 and of decreasing lengths, to be activated following
prior authorisation by the General Shareholders’ Meeting
of Banca Generali.

The indemnities accrued over the term of the Programme
will be, in any event, paid out in one tranche, within 60
days from the General Shareholders’ Meeting called to
approve the 2026 Financial Statements.

For each plan, a portion of the accrued indemnity may be
paid out in Banca Generali shares (up to a maximum of
50%), following an assessment of the potential effects at
the level of capital ratios and floating capital by the Cor-
porate Bodies (Board of Directors and General Share-
holders’ Meeting).

Participation in each of the plans envisaged by the Pro-
gramme is reserved for Financial Advisors and Relation-
ship Managers who have at least five years of company
seniority by 31 December of the financial year before the
reference year for each Plan.

To be eligible to access the benefits of the plans it is nec-

essary:

— to achieve at the end of the reference year a minimum
volume of total AUM and qualified AUM increasing
over time and with non-negative net inflows (vesting
condition);

— to be regularly employed and not in a notice period
on the disbursement date, except when the termina-
tion of employment is caused by death or permanent
incapacity, retirement or withdrawal from the relation-
ship by Banca Generali not for cause (condition of
service).

In the event of death, the indemnities accrued are under-
stood to be permanently acquired, but are payable to the
heirs under the same conditions specified for the other
beneficiaries.

Finally, the accrued indemnity is commensurate for each
individual plan with a rate for verified AUM and is differ-
entiated according to the type of person (Financial Advi-
sor/RM) and service seniority until a cap is reached.

Recognition of the indemnities on the disbursement
date is also subject to the Banking Group’s access
gates being exceeded as defined in the Remuneration
Policies applicable from time to time and the rules of

propriety.

The number of Banca Generali shares due is determined
in the same way as for the share-based payment Plans
connected with the Remuneration Policies, namely based
on the average price of Banca Generali shares during the
three months prior to the meeting of the Board of Direc-
tors that approves the draft Separate and Consolidated
Financial Statements for the year prior to that in which
the annual plan of reference begins.

For the two annual plans launched up to the reporting
date, 50% of the indemnity accrued can be paid out in
shares.

The accrued indemnity value was determined based on
the AUM of the plan’s potential beneficiaries at 31 De-
