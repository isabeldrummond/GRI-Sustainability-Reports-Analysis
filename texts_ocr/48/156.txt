Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of the Group in-
clude the financial statements of Assicurazioni Generali
SpA and its subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities)
over which the Group has control. Control is achieved
when the Group is exposed, or has rights to variable re-
turns from its involvement with the investee and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over the
investee.

Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only

if, the Group has:

— power over the investee (i.e., existing not merely pro-
tective rights that give it the current ability to direct the
relevant activities of the investee, that impact meaning-
fully the returns of the investee);

— exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involve-
ment with the investee;

— the ability to use its power over the investee to affect
its returns.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting
rights result in control. To support this presumption and

when the Group has less than a majority of the voting

or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all

relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it

has power over an investee, including:

— The contractual arrangement with the other vote hold-
ers of the investee;

— Rights arising from other contractual arrangements;

- The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.

The Group reviews periodically and systematically if
there was a variation of one or more elements of control,
based on the analysis of the facts and the essential cir-
cumstances.

Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in
the consolidated financial statements from the date the
Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to
control the subsidiary.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements:

— the financial statements of the Parent Company and its
subsidiaries are consolidated line by line through spe-
cific “reporting package”, which contribute to the con-
sistent application of the Group’s accounting policies.
For consolidation purposes, if the financial year-end
