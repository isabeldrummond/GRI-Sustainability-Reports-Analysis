Group operates and due to disposal of some Group companies during the year (Colombia, Ireland, Netherlands and

Panama).

45 Provisions for defined benefit
plans

The pension benefits of Generali Group’s employees are
mainly in the form of defined benefit plans and defined
contribution plans.

As for defined benefit plans, participants are granted a
defined pension benefits either by the employers or via
external entities.

The main defined benefits plans are concentrated in Ger-
many, Austria and Switzerland, while in Italy the provision
for Trattamento di fine rapporto (employee severance
pay) matured until 1st January 2007 is included in the pro-
visions for defined benefit plan for € 97 million.

The table below shows the movements in the defined
benefit plans liability which occurred during the financial
year, net of assets legally separate and held solely to pay
or fund employee benefits:

(€ million) 31/12/2018 31/12/2017
Net liability as at 31 December previous year 4,001 4,298
Foreign currency translation effects 5 12
Net expense recognised in the income statement 155 130
Re-measurements recognised in Other Comprehensive Income -124 71
Contributions and benefits paid -185 -171
Changes in consolidation scope and other changes -128 -172
Net liability as at 31 December current year 3,722 4,001

The item “Change in consolidation scope and other
changes” mainly reflects the classification of the oper-
ations in Belgium and related to Generlai Leben as “dis-
posal groups classified as held for sale”, in application
of IFRS 5.

Part of the Group’s defined benefit plans have assets that
are designated, but not legally segregated, to meet the
pension defined benefit obligations. These are invest-
ments backing insurance provisions or policies issued by
Generali Group companies, or other investments owned
by the Group entities. Consequently, in accordance with
IAS 19, these investments are not recognised as plan as-

sets and so cannot be deducted from the defined ben-
efit obligations. However, to assess the net liability for
defined benefit plans, these assets should have been
netted against the present value of the related pension
obligations.

In Germany and Austria, where is allocated approximate-
ly 90% of the present net value of defined benefit obliga-
tions, the pension guarantee associations, for yearly con-
tributions to be paid by the companies, are liable for the
fulfilment of the pension commitments granted in case of
company insolvency.
