quired by the ISVAP Regulation No. 7 of 13 July 2007,

rency used by the entity that prepared the financial state-
ments) and the amounts are shown in millions, unless

Consolidation methods

Investments in subsidiaries are consolidated line by line,
whereas investments in associated companies and inter-
ests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity
method.

The balance sheet items of the financial statements de-
nominated in foreign currencies are translated into Euro
based on the exchange rates at the end of the year.

The profit and loss account items are translated based
on the average exchange rates of the year. They reason-
ably approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions.

The exchange rate differences arising from the transla-
tion of the statements expressed in foreign currencies
are accounted for in equity in an appropriate reserve and
recognized in the profit and loss account only at the time
of the disposal of the investments.
