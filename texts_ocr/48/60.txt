Management Report

 

The new production in terms of present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) stood
at € 18,443 million, down 3.5% following the contraction of both the present value of
future regular premiums (-5.0%) and single premiums (-2.2%).

The production of protection products shows good growth (+16.6%). Savings products
are down (-4.7%) in line with the Group's actions aimed at reducing the guaranteed
business; moreover, despite the satisfactory contribution of "hybrid" products, there
was a reduction in unit-linked production (-2.2%).

The new business margin (expressed as a percentage of PVNBP) increased by 0.58
percentage points, from 4.72% in 2017 to 5.30% in 2018. The satisfactory increase is
driven by the continuous recalibration of the financial guarantees offered, combined
with the sale of highly profitable hybrid products.

New business value amounted to € 978 million, an improvement on the previous year
(+8.3%).

The decrease in gross written premiums is attributable to both the motor segment
(-1.7%), which is affected by the continued decline in the portfolio linked to the policy
of improving profitability in a market still suffering from a crisis in profitability, and to the
non-motor segment. The contraction of the latter (-1.5%) is mainly attributable to the
Corporate business component as well as to the A&H sector, reflecting heavy competi-
tion in a market characterized by sustained price competition.

The combined ratio increased slightly due to the increase in the expense ratio compo-
nent, mainly linked to growth in the non-motor portfolio, only partially offset by the slight
improvement in both the current year loss ratio and prior year loss ratio.

 

 

 

Germany

 

In Germany, where Generali has been operating since 1837, the Group ranks second
in terms of total premium income due to a 9.5% market share in the Life business
(also including health business), in which it plays a leadership role in the unit-linked
and protection lines, and to a 5.3% P&C share, distinguished by high premium
profitability.
In 2018, after having successfully concluded a preliminary strategic and organisation
revision (with the Simpler Smarter for You programme), Generali sped up implementation
of the strategy in Germany by starting up the second phase of the strategic programme,
called Simpler, Smarter for You to Lead. This phase is aimed at making full use of the
growth potential and the competitive edges that were still unexpressed in order to
create value in terms of:

- maximisation of operational efficiency with creation of the “One company” model that
involves unifying employees in two main companies, creation of three product fac-
tories serving all distribution channels with considerable management and corporate
synergies, and rationalisation of the brands portfolio, with significant strengthening of
the Generali brand;

— maximisation of the distribution power by integrating the channel of exclusive Gen-
erali agents in the DVAG network (the largest insurance distribution network in the
country), which operates under a new exclusive distribution agreement for Generali
brand products; the strengthening of its leadership in the direct channel (CosmosDi-
rekt) through sizeable investments in the simplification of the processes and exten-
sion to new forms of digital intermediation and the focusing of the broker channel on
improvement of profitability and on the digitalisation process (Dialog);

— mitigation of the interest rate risk: during 2018, Generali started the sale of 89.9% of
Generali Leben after agreeing on an industrial partnership with Viridium Gruppe for
the profitable management of the Life portfolio having high guarantees.
