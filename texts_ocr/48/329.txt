2.3 Dispute proceedings

As stated in the 2016 and 2017 Integrated Annual Re-
port and Consolidated Financial Statements, the Brazil-
ian company Banco BTG Pactual S.A. (“BTG”) initiated a
dispute in 2016 relating to certain claims for compensa-
tion made by BTG pursuant to an agreement whereby
the sale to the latter of Banca della Svizzera Italiana S.A.
(“BSI”) by a Generali subsidiary was concluded in Sep-
tember 2015.

In this regard, the Board of Statutory Auditors received
periodic updates from Group Legal Affairs on the evolu-
tion of the dispute during the meetings of the Board of
Directors and RRC, and examined the opinions prepared
by external lawyers. The Board of Statutory Auditors also
met the Manager in Charge of preparing the Company’s
Financial Reports and the auditing firm EY, with a view
to monitoring the process conducted by them, insofar
as falls within their respective remits, for the purpose of
conducting the necessary evaluations relating to possi-
ble provisions pursuant to IAS 37 as well as the corre-
sponding disclosure.

As stated in the 2018 Integrated Annual Report and Con-
solidated Financial Statements, the Company, taking into
account the status of the arbitration proceedings and the
legal opinions obtained, decided that the conditions of
probability and ability to make the reliable estimate re-
quired by IAS 37 for any risk provisions associated with
BTG’s said claim for damages.

3. Related-party and intercompany
transactions. Atypical and/or
unusual transactions (points 2 and 3
of Consob Notice no. 1025564/07)

The Company has introduced “Related-Party Transaction
Procedures” (“RPT Procedures”), adopted in compliance
with Consob Regulation 17221/2010, as amended, and
Art. 2391-bis of the Civil Code, which are also applicable
to transactions performed by subsidiaries.

The Board of Statutory Auditors concludes that the

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

aforementioned procedures comply with Consob Regu-
lation 17221/2010, as amended; the BSA monitored the
Company’s compliance with the said procedures during
the year.

Assicurazioni Generali’s 2018 Annual Financial State-
ments and the 2018 Integrated Annual Report and Con-
solidated Financial Statements illustrate the economic
and asset-related effects of the related-party transac-
tions, and describe the most significant relationships.
No transactions classifiable as major transactions pur-
suant to the above-mentioned RPT Procedures were
submitted for the attention of the RPTC during the 2018
financial year, nor did any urgent related-party transac-
tions take place.

With regard to intercompany transactions during the
year, the supervisory activity of the Board of Auditors
shows that they have been implemented in compliance
with IVASS Regulation no. 30/2016 on intragroup trans-
actions and risk concentrations, as well as the Policy on
Infra-Group Transactions adopted by the Board of Di-
rectors on 15 March 2017. The main intercompany ac-
tivities, with payment at market prices or at cost, were
conducted by means of reinsurance and coinsurance
agreements, administration and management of securi-
ties and real estate, claims management and settlement,
IT and administrative services, loans and guarantees,
and personnel loans. Said services allowed the ration-
alisation of operational functions and a better level of
services.

The BSA concluded that the information provided by the
Board of Directors in the 2018 Annual Financial State-
ments of the company relating to intercompany and re-
lated-party transactions was adequate.

As far as we are aware, no atypical and/or unusual trans-
actions were carried out in 2018.
