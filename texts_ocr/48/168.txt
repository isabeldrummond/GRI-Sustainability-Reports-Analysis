Held to maturity financial assets

The category comprises the non-derivative financial
assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturity that a company has the positive intention and
ability to hold to maturity, other than loans and receiva-
bles and those initially designated as at fair value through
profit or loss or as available for sale. The intent and ability
to hold investments to maturity must be demonstrated
when initially acquired and at each reporting date.

In the case of an early disposal (significant and not due
to particular events) of said investments, any remaining
investments must be reclassified as available for sale.

Held to maturity investments are accounted for at settle-
ment date and measured initially at fair value and subse-
quently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method and considering any discounts or premiums ob-
tained at the time of the acquisition which are accounted
for over the remaining term to maturity.

Loans and receivables

This category comprises non-derivative financial assets
with fixed or determinable payments, not quoted in an
active market. It does not include financial assets held
for trading and those designated as at fair value through
profit or loss or as available for sale upon initial recogni-
tion.

In detail, the Generali Group includes in this category
some unquoted bonds, mortgage loans, policy loans,
term deposits with credit institutions, deposits under re-
insurance business accepted, repurchase agreements,
receivables from banks or customers accounted for by
companies of the financial segment, and the mandatory
deposit reserve with the central bank. The Group’s trade
receivables are instead classified as other receivables in
the balance sheet.

Loans and receivables are accounted for at settlement
date and measured initially at fair value and subsequently
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method
and considering any discounts or premiums obtained at
the time of the acquisition which are accounted for over
the remaining term to maturity. Short-term receivables
are not discounted because the effect of discounting

cash flows is immaterial. Gains or losses are recognised
in the profit and loss account when the financial assets
are de-recognised or impaired as well as through the
normal amortization process envisaged by the amortised
cost principle.

Available for sale financial assets

Available for sale financial assets are accounted for at the
settlement date at the fair value at the related transaction
dates, plus the transaction costs directly attributable to
the acquisition.

The unrealized gains and losses on available for sale fi-
nancial assets arising out of subsequent changes in val-
ue are recognised in other comprehensive income in a
specific reserve until they are sold or impaired. At this
time the cumulative gains or losses previously recog-
nised in other comprehensive income are accounted for
in the profit and loss account.

This category includes quoted and unquoted equities,
investment fund units (IFU) not held for trading, nor des-
ignated as financial assets at fair value through profit or
loss, and bonds, mainly quoted, designated as available
for sale.

Interests on debt financial instruments classified as
available for sale are measured using the effective inter-
est rate with impact on profit or loss. Dividends related to
equities classified in this category are reported in profit or
loss when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is
established, which usually coincides with the sharehold-
ers’ resolution.

The Group evaluates whether the ability and intention
to sell its Available for sale financial assets in the near
term is still appropriate. When, in rare circumstances, the
Group is unable to trade these financial assets due to
inactive markets and management's intention to do so
significantly changes in the foreseeable future, the Group
may elect to reclassify these financial assets. Reclassi-
fication to loans and receivables is permitted when the
financial assets meet the definition of loans and receiv-
ables and the Group has the intent and ability to hold
these assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity.
Reclassification to the held to maturity category is per-
mitted only when the entity has the ability and intention
to hold the financial asset accordingly.
