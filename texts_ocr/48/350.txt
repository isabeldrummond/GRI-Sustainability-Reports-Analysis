Data and cyber security: the quantity and quality of
personal data now available is such that they must be
managed carefully and professionally to ensure their con-
fidentiality. The risks arising from the computerized man-
agement of acquired data and the vulnerability of sys-
tems to external or internal attacks require appropriate
prevention and protection systems that ensure the pro-
tection of all stakeholders and business continuity.

Demographic and social change: migration, new fam-
ily structures, new coming generations and the aging
of the population due to the fall in the birth rate and
the increase in average life expectancy have relevant
impact on public finances (in the management of both
pensions and health care) and the attitude of citizens
towards saving.

Distribution NPS (Net Promoter System): NPS approach
to get a systematic feedback from distributors (including
brokers and banks). This approach is like T-NPS, but cov-
ers the overall relationship with each distributor and is not
focused on a specific transaction. A questionnaire is sent
via email. As for T-NPS approach, detractor distributors
are systematically called back to understand the prob-
lem faced and solve it (quick wins). Those problems that
have a more structural nature - and need, for example a
revision of core processes and practices or investments
- are addressed and solved in a cross-functional working
group (structural improvements), with the aim to provide
an outstanding service to our distributors.

Distributor: sales force within traditional distribution net-
works (exclusive agents, non-exclusive agents and em-
ployed sales force permanently involved in the activities
of promoting and distributing Generali products).

Diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities: enhancing
diversity, promoting inclusion and contrasting any kind of
discrimination allow us to create the best possible con-
ditions in our relationships with stakeholders and to pro-
mote targeted behavior to prevent inequalities.

Earnings per share: it is equal to the ratio of Group net
result and to weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding.

Employee engagement and promotion of a common cul-
ture: Strengthening the motivation and commitment of
employees to meeting our goals is important for main-
taining a single, shared company vision. Dialogue and
listening activities and the sharing of information are key
aspects for the involvement of employees.
