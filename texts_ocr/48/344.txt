Life technical provisions estimation

The technical provisions of the life segment,
recorded at 31 December 2018 for an amount
equal to Eur 346,108 million, refer to insurance
contacts and investment contracts with
discretionary participation features. According
to IFRS 4, the provisions are accounted for
based on local GAAP applied by the individual
insurance companies of the Group in their
separate financial statements. Liabilities related
to these contacts are determined analytically for
each type of contract on the basis of
appropriate actuarial assumptions, and are
adjusted to cope with all existing commitments
in the best estimates scenario; these also
include the policyholders’ share of the
difference between the carrying value of the
basis on which the profit sharing is determined
and the corresponding value used to determine
the current profit retroceded to the
policyholders ("shadow accounting"). In
accordance with IFRS 4, in order to verify the
adequacy of the life technical provisions, a
Liability Adequacy Test (LAT) is carried out. This
test is performed through the comparison of the
IFRS reserve, which include the impact of
“shadow accounting", net of any deferred
acquisition costs (DACs) or intangible assets
related to the contracts under analysis (VoBa),
with the current value of future net cash flows
relating to insurance contracts.

The financial statement information relating to
life insurance provisions is disclosed in the
explanatory notes in the section "Accounting
principles” and in note n. 13.

The valuation of the life technical provisions is
therefore a well-structured estimation process
that requires the use of complex statistical and
actuarial calculation methods and models,
characterized by a high level of subjectivity
when choosing the assumptions, such as
mortality, morbidity, discount rates, expenses
and inflation.

Furthermore, the persistence of low interest rate
level, in past years, in many of the countries

The audit response included several procedures,
the most relevant of which are outlined below:

« Anunderstanding of estimation process
of life technical provisions designed by
the Group and of the related key
controls, as well as the testing of these
controls; these procedures were carried
out with reference to the controls over
completeness, accuracy and
appropriateness of data related to the
insurance portfolio used to calculate the
life technical provisions, taking into
consideration also the control activities
performed by the actuarial function of
the Group and the related results;

e The evaluation of the appropriateness of
the methodologies and the
reasonableness of the assumptions used
by the Group to perform the Liability
Adequacy Test (LAT) with regard to the
purposes of the test itself as defined by
IFRS 4 and the performance of test of
detail on the underlying data, including
those referring to “shadow accounting”,
DAC and VoBa elements;

« The assessment of the compliance of
the methodologies used for the
attribution to the policyholders of the
difference between the carrying value of
the basis on which the profit sharing is
determined and the corresponding value
used to determine the current profit
retroceded to the policyholders, in
accordance with IFRS 4;

« Comparative analyses through the
calculation of appropriate indicators
observed historically and their
correlation with other significant
financial statements indicators, as well
as the consistency with other financial
statements information, the expected
values and the results determined in
previous financial years;
