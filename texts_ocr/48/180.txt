Fair value

IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement provides guidance on
fair value measurement and requires disclosures about
fair value measurements, including the classification of fi-
nancial assets and liabilities in fair value hierarchy levels.

With reference to the investments, Generali Group meas-
ures financial assets and liabilities at fair value in the fi-
nancial statements, or discloses the contrary in the notes.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transac-
tion between market participants at the measurement
date (exit price). In particular, an orderly transaction
takes place in the principal or most advantageous mar-
ket at the measurement date under current market con-
ditions.

A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction

to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

(a) in the principal market for the asset or liability; or

(b) in the absence of a principal market, in the most ad-
vantageous market for the asset or liability.

The fair value is equal to market price if market informa-
tion are available (i.e. relative trading levels of identical
or similar instruments) into an active market, which is
defined as a market where the items traded within the
market are homogeneous, willing buyers and sellers can
normally be found at any time and prices are available to
the public.

If there isn’t an active market, a valuation technique
should be used which shall maximise the observable in-
puts. If the fair value cannot be measured reliably, am-
ortised cost is used as the best estimate in determining
the fair value.
