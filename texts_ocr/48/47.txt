Non-operating result

The non-operating result of the Group came to € -1,361
million (€ -1,109 million at 31 December 2017). In par-
ticular:

— net impairment losses increased to € -431 million
(€ -271 million at 31 December 2017) mainly due to
higher impairments on equity financial investments, es-
pecially posted in the last quarter of the year;

— net realized gains amounted to € 265 million (€ 311 at
31 December 2017), benefiting € 113 million from the
disposal of the investment in Italo - Nuovo Trasporto
Viaggiatori. The decrease in realized gains compared
to the previous period is mainly due to the bond and
real estate component, reflecting the planned policy of
supporting future returns on investments;

— net non-operating income from financial instruments at
fair value reached € 11 million (€ 26 million at 31 De-
cember 2017);

— other net non-operating expenses decreased slightly
to € -411 million (€ -419 million at 31 December 2017).
