The following reclassifications were made in the calcu-
lation of the operating result with respect to the corre-
sponding items of the income statement:

— the investment management and investment property
management expenses in the operating result were re-
classified from acquisition and administration costs to
net operating income from other financial instruments,
more specifically into other expenses from financial in-
struments and land and buildings (investment proper-
ties);

- income and expenses related to real estate develop-
ment activities in the operating result were classified
as other non-operating income and expenses, in ac-
cordance with the management model adopted that
provides for sale at completion;

- gains and losses on foreign currencies in the operating
result were reclassified in the Life and Holding and oth-
er business from net operating income to net operating
income from financial instruments at fair value through
profit or loss. In the Property & Casualty segment,
gains and losses on foreign currencies in the operating
result were reclassified from net operating income to
net non-operating income from financial instruments at
fair value through profit or loss. The classification for
each segment is consistent with the related classifica-
tion of the derivative transaction drawn up in order to
hedge the Group’s equity exposure to the changes in
the main currencies of operations. The net operating
and non-operating income from other financial instru-
ments are therefore not subject to financial market vol-
atility;

- in net operating income from financial instruments,
interest expenses on deposits and current accounts
under reinsurance business are not included among
interest expenses related to liabilities linked to operat-
ing activities but are deducted from the related interest
income. Moreover, the interest expenses related to the
abovementioned real estate development activities are
not included in interest expenses related to liabilities
linked to operating activities, but are classified under
other non-operating income and expenses in accord-
ance with the management mod- el adopted that pro-
vides for sale at completion;

— the net other operating expenses in the operating result
were adjusted for operating taxes and for non-recurring
taxes that significantly affect the operating income of
the countries where policyholders’ stakes are deter-
mined by taking the taxes for the period into account.
These adjustments were included in the calculation of
operating income and are excluded from the income
taxes item.

Operating result by margins

The operating result of the various segments was also
shown in accordance with a margin-based layout which
shows the operating trends of the changes that occurred
in each segment performance more clearly.

The operating result of the Life segment comprises a
technical margin including insurance costs, a net invest-
ment result and a component that includes acquisition
and administration costs related to the insurance busi-
ness and other net operating expenses. The technical
margin includes the loadings and the risk and profit from
the surrender results for the period.

The net investment result comprises operating income
from investments, net of the portion attributable to the
policyholders. Finally, the insurance management and
other operating components are indicated separately.

The operating result for the Property & Casualty segment
comprises the technical result, the financial result and oth-
er operating items. The technical result is equivalent to the
insurance activity result, i.e. the difference between premi-
ums and claims, acquisition and administration costs and
other net technical income. The investment result compris-
es current income from investments and other operating
net financial expenses, like expenses on investment man-
agement and interest expenses on operating debt. Finally,
other operating items mainly include acquisition and ad-
ministration costs related to the insurance business, de-
preciation of tangible assets and amortization of long-term
costs, provisions for recurring risks and other taxes.

Operating return on equity

The operating return on equity indicates the return on
capital in terms of the Group operating result. It is calcu-
lated through the relationship between:

— consolidated operating result as described above ad-
justed to include:

— interest on financial debt;

- income taxes based on a mid-term expected tax
rate;

- minority interests;

— average Group shareholders’ equity at the beginning
and end of each period of valuation, adjusted to ex-
clude other gains and losses booked directly to equity
included in Other Comprehensive Income OCI such as
gains and losses on AFS investments, foreign currency
translation differences, net unrealized gains and losses
on hedging derivatives.
