The Report also adopts the Guiding Principles of the International <IR> Framework.

The Strategic focus and future orientation principle is applied in the whole document. Indeed, our value creation is
based on the strategy that includes the material aspects to the Group. The Materiality approach is presented in detail
in the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement.

In accordance with the Connectivity of information principle, the report should represent the combination and inter-
relatedness of the factors that influence the ability to create value over time. The key forms of connectivity used by
Generali include the connectivity between qualitative and quantitative information, financial and non-financial informa-
tion, that is coherent with the information included in other communication tools in accordance with the Core&More
reporting approach. Other elements that improve the connectivity of information and the overall usefulness of the
report are the cross-referencing , the graphic component and a Glossary at the end of this document to use in case
of insurance sector’s terminology.

Generali maintains Stakeholder relationships in order to understand and meet their
needs, especially their information and dialogue needs.

We regularly engage with investors, analysts and rating agencies. We meet them
every quarter following our results’ presentation and in specific occasions, thus
sharing the reporting required. We organise roadshows and we participate in sec-
tor conferences. Some of the main annual recurring occasions for interaction be-
tween the financial community and the Company’s top management are the annual
Shareholders’ Meeting and the Investor Day. During the latter, in November 2018 we
presented the new strategic plan. During the year we came into contact with more
than 540 people - individual meetings and small group meetings - in the main finan-
cial centres of Europe and North America.

We regularly interact with regulators and the European and international Institutions to maintain good relationships
and share authoritative and updated information in order to properly interpret and apply new regulations. We also
offer our skills and contribute to public consultations for the definition of new laws and regulations in the sector, by
providing, in view of the Group’s direct experience, concrete indications in order to safeguard the specificities of the
Group and the insurance industry. To this purpose, we collaborate with several trade organizations and associations.
Our active presence in these organizations allows us also to expand our knowledge of the different regulations and
potential impacts.

We also engage customers, distributors and Group employees with a view to continuous improvement.

For some years we interact with students from the main Italian universities, providing them with specific sessions on
the reporting approach adopted by Generali and its developments at a national and international level, while collecting
their feedback and suggestions on the integrated report implementation through a specific survey. As from 2016, we
have extended this experience to Group employees as well. Overall, we met more than 300 people in 2018.
