Risk Report | Outlook | Statement

The main impacts are explained below:

- the elimination in the non-life segment and holding
and other businesses segment of participations and
loans to companies of other segments, belonging to
the same country, as well as related income (dividends
and interests)

— the elimination in the non-life segment and holding and
other businesses segment of realized gains and losses
arising from intra-segment operations

— the elimination in the life segment of participations
and loans to companies of other segments, belonging
to the same country, as well the related income (divi-
dends and interests) if not backing technical reserves

- the elimination in the life segment of realized gains
and losses arising from intra-segment operations if not
backing technical reserves.

Furthermore, loans and related interest expenses on
loans between Group companies belonging to different
segments are eliminated directly in each segment.

This approach allows to reduce consolidation adjust-
ments, which in this view principally consist of invest-
ments and dividends received by life and non-life com-
panies from companies belonging to other segments,
intragroup financing and related interest income and
fee and commissions income and expenses on financial
services rendered or received by Group companies, still
allowing for an adequate performance presentation for
each segment.

beginning of 2018 and effective for a large part of the

year, made up of the business units of the three main

markets - Italy, France and Germany - and four regional
structures:

— ACEER: Austria, Central Eastern Europe (CEE) coun-
tries - Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia,
Serbia/Montenegro, Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria and
Croatia - and Russia;

- International, consisting of Spain, Switzerland, Ameri-
cas and Southern Europe, Asia, Europ Assistance and
Other companies (including, Generali Global Health
and Generali Employee Benefits);

— Investments, Asset & Wealth Management, which in-
cludes the main Group entities operating in investment
advisory, asset management and financial planning;

- Group holding and other companies, which includes
the Parent Company’s management and coordination
activities, including Group reinsurance, other financial
holding companies and suppliers of international ser-
vices not included in the previous geographical areas.

In order to provide a management view of the key per-
formance indicators, the geographical reporting is dis-
closed as country’s or regional structure’s consolidated
view, instead of contribution to the Group’s results. The
elimination of transactions between Generali Group com-
panies in different geographic regions is included within
the cluster “Holding and other businesses”.
