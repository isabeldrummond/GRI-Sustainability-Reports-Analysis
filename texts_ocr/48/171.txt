Tax receivables

Receivables related to current income taxes as defined
and regulated by IAS 12 are classified in this item. They
are accounted for based on the tax laws in force in the
countries where the consolidated subsidiaries have their
Offices.

Current income tax relating to items recognised directly
in equity are recognised in equity and not in the income
statement.

Other assets

The item mainly includes accrued income and prepay-
ments, specifically accrued interest from bonds.

It also comprises deferred commissions for investment
management services related to investment contracts.

liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Acquisition
commissions related to these products are accounted for
in accordance with the IAS 18 treatment of the invest-
ment management service component. They are recog-
nised along the product life by reference to the stage of
completion of the service rendered. Therefore, acquisi-
tion commissions are incremental costs recognised as
assets, which are amortised throughout the whole policy
term on a straight line approach, reasonably assuming
that the management service is constantly rendered.

Deferred commissions for investment management ser-
vices are amortised, after assessing their recoverability in
accordance with IAS 36.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash in hand and equivalent assets, cash and balances
with banks payable on demand and with central banks
are accounted for in this item at their carrying amounts.

Short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily con-
vertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject
to an insignificant risk of changes in value are included in
this item. Investments are qualified as cash equivalents
only when they have a short maturity of 3 months or less
from the date of the acquisition.
