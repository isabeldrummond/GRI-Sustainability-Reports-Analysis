Each priority is supported by specific Group initiatives, the results of which are measured and monitored over time
to ensure continuous improvement.

To measure and promote the engagement of our people, in June 2017 we carried
out the second edition of the Generali Global Engagement Survey, a managerial tool
for continuous improvement. In the course of 2018, leveraging our strengths, we
established specific action plans for the opportunities for improvement. The priorities
mainly identified in the local action plans were:

— foster strategy cascading and communication;

— keep investing in performance management tools and meritocracy;

- accelerate on efficiency and velocity;

— further enhance a diverse and inclusive culture.

Since January 2018, more than 390 local actions were planned, initiated and
communicated. At the end of December 2018, 92% of these were already
implemented, with a view to launching 100% of the actions by the end of June 2019,
coinciding with the third edition of the Generali Global Engagement Survey.

 

To create and spread a culture focusing on the empowerment of our people, in

2017 we designed and rolled out the Managerial Acceleration Program (MAP). MAP
fosters and strengthens a managerial culture capable of engaging and boosting the
accountability of our people in line with the eight key managerial behaviours of the
Generali Empowerment Manifesto (GEM).

MAP is dedicated to the management population and fully facilitated by Group
managers who have participated in special training and coaching initiatives (189
trainers trained in 2018).

In 2018, 4,218 managers participated in the MAP. The goal is to train 8,900 of them by
the end of 2019.

Increasing the accountability of our people also means boosting a performance
culture. Through Group Performance Management we focus our efforts on spreading
this culture while also strengthening transparency and meritocracy in line with what
our people asked in the Generali Global Engagement Survey.

In 2018, 99%" of our people participated in a programme involving: defining
objectives, assessing performance, feedback and individual development plans.

18 The data exclusively refer to Group companies, equal to 54,743 employees (77.4% of the total), within the scope of the Group Performance Management process.
