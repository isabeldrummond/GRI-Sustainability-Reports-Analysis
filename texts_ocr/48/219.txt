Assets transferred that do not qualify for
derecognition

Generali Group in the context of its business activities
enters into securities lending transactions (REPO e Re-
verse REPO). In general, if the Group retains substantially
all risks and rewards of the financial assets underlying
these transactions, the Group continues to recognise the
underlying assets.

For REPO contracts, the Group continues to recognise
in its financial statements the underlying financial asset
as the risks and benefits are retained by the Group. The
consideration received upon ale is recognised as a lia-
bility.

As far as Reverse REPO transactions are concerned, if
all the underlying risks and rewards are retained by the
counterparty for the entire life of the transaction, the re-
lated financial asset is not recognised as an asset in the
Group’s financial statements. The consideration paid is
accounted for within the loans and receivable category.

Finally, the Group is committed in a variety of transactions
in which some financial assets are pledged as collateral
but they are still recognised in the financial statements
because all risks and rewards are retained by the Group.

As at 31 December 2018, the Group has retained sub-
stantially all risks and rewards arising from the ownership
of the transferred assets and there are no transfers of
financial assets which have been completely or partially
derecognised on which the Group continues to control.
In particular, the Group continues to recognize, in terms
of market value, approximately € 12,058 million of finan-
cial assets linked to various contracts such as, securities
lending transactions, mainly in France for € 6,969 million,
repurchase agreements for € 2,331 and assets pledged
as collateral for € 2,758 million (please refer to the par-
agraph Contingent liabilities, commitments, guarantees,
pledged assets and collaterals in section Additional In-
formation).
