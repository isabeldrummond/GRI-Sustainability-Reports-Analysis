statements and the consolidated financial statements of
the Company as at 31 December 2018.

The Board of Statutory Auditors monitored, within the
terms of its duties, the general layout of the financial
statements and the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the legislation and specific regulations
governing drafting of insurance companies’ financial
statements. The BSA recognises that the consolidated
financial statements of the Group were drawn up in
compliance with the IAS/IFRS International Account-
ing Standards issued by the IASB and approved by the
European Union, in compliance with EU Regulation no.
1606 of 19 July 2002 and the TUIF, and Legislative De-
cree 209/2005, as amended. The consolidated financial
statements were also drawn up on the basis of the re-
quirements of ISVAP Regulation no. 7 of 13 July 2007, as
amended, and contain the information required by Con-
sob Notice no. 6064293 of 28 July 2006. The Explanatory
Notes to the Financial Statements illustrate the evalua-
tion criteria used, and provide the information required by
applicable legislation.

The Report on Operations annexed to the draft financial
statements of the parent company illustrates the busi-
ness trend, indicating current and prospective develop-
ments, as well as the Group’s development and reorgani-
sation process.

Together with the independent auditors and the Manager
in Charge of preparing the Company’s Financial Reports,
the Board of Statutory Auditors was heard by the RCC
in the context of the assessments for which the latter is
responsible, together with the Manager in Charge of pre-
paring the Company’s Financial Reports as regards the
correct use of accounting principles and the consistency
of their use for the purposes of preparing the consoli-
dated financial statements.

On 03 April 2019, EY issued its additional report to the
Board of Statutory Auditors, in its capacity as Internal
Control and Audit Committee pursuant to Art. 11 of EU
537/2014. In compliance with the provisions of Art. 19,
paragraph 1(a), of Legislative Decree 39/2010, the BSA
sent this report in a timely manner to the Board of Direc-
tors, without making comments.

 

The BSA also held meetings with the heads of the audit-
ing company EY pursuant to Art. 150, paragraph 3, of the
TUIF and Art. 74, paragraph 3(e) of IVASS Regulation no.
38/2018. During said meetings, appropriate exchanges
of data and information took place that were relevant for
the performance of the respective tasks, and no facts or
situations worthy of being highlighted emerged. In the
context of supervision pursuant to Art. 19 of Legislative
Decree 39/2010, the Board of Statutory Auditors also ac-
quired information from EY with reference to the planning
and execution of the audit.

Pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 1(e) of Legislative De-
cree no. 39/2010, the Board of Statutory Auditors, in
its capacity as Internal Control and Audit Committee,
checked and monitored the independence of the audit-
ing firm. In the performance of those checks, no situa-
tions were found that prejudiced the independence of the
auditing firm or constituted grounds for incompatibility
pursuant to the applicable legislation. This is confirmed
by the statement issued by EY S.p.A. pursuant to Art. 6,
para. 2(a) of Reg. EU 537/2014.

With reference to non-audit services, at the request and
with the support of the BSA, on 1 January 2017 the Com-
pany adopted a specific procedure aimed at governing
the appointment of the auditing firm and a company be-
longing to their network of permitted services other than
audits (“Guideline for the assignment of non-audit servic-
es to auditors”). During 2018, the Board of Statutory Au-
ditors supervised the implementation of some changes
to the Guidelines as mentioned above, aimed at aligning
them with the interpretative development of current leg-
islation and applicable practices. This review process led
to the adoption of an updated version of the Guidelines
on 6 July 2018. After that date, the BSA requested that
further processes be implemented to raise awareness
among Group companies as regards the correct applica-
tion of the new Guidelines.

During the 2018 financial year, in compliance with the
provisions of Art. 19, paragraph 1(e) of Legislative De-
cree 39/2010 and Art. 5, par. 4, of Reg. EU 537/2014,
the Board of Statutory Auditors, in its role as the Internal
Control and Audit Committee, previously examined the
proposals for non-audit services conferred on the inde-
pendent auditors or companies belonging to the relevant
network subject to its attention.

As part of its assessments, the Board of Statutory Audi-
tors has not only verified the compatibility of these ser-
vices with the prohibitions of Art. 5 of Reg. EU 537/2014,
but also the absence of potential risks for the independ-
ence of the auditor deriving from the performance of said
services in light of the provisions contained in Legislative
Decree 39/2010 (Articles 10 et seq.), in the Issuers Regu-
lation (Art. 149-bis and following) and Audit Principle n.
100.

As the statutory pre-requisites were fulfilled, the BSA
approved the commissioning of the service from EY or
other companies belonging to its network.

The fees for non-audit services by the auditing firm or
other companies belonging to their network for the com-
pany and its subsidiaries in the 2018 financial year are
disclosed in detail in the Notes to the Financial State-
ments. During the year, the Board of Statutory Auditors,
as the Internal Control and Audit Committee, supervised
the trend of said fees.
