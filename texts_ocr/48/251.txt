39 Fair value hierarchy

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the consol-
idated financial statements are measured and classified
in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in IFRS13,
which consists of three levels based on the observability
of inputs within the corresponding valuation techniques
used.

The fair value hierarchy levels are based on the type of

inputs used to determine the fair value:

- Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity
can access at the measurement date.

— Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included with-
in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly (i.e. quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are

observable for the asset or liability; market-corroborat-
ed inputs).

— Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or
liability, which reflect the assumptions that market par-
ticipants would use when pricing the asset or liability,
including assumptions about risk (of the model used
and of inputs used).

The fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety
in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest
level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the
entire measurement requires judgement, taking into ac-
count factors specific to the asset or liability.

A fair value measurement developed using a present
value technique might be categorised within Level 2 or
Level 3, depending on the inputs that are significant to
the entire measurement and the level of the fair value hi-
erarchy within which those inputs are categorised.

If an observable input requires an adjustment using an
unobservable input and that adjustment results in a sig-
nificantly higher or lower fair value measurement, the
resulting measurement would be categorised within the
level attributable to the input with the lowest level uti-
lized.

Adequate controls have been set up to monitor all meas-
urements including those provided by third parties. If
