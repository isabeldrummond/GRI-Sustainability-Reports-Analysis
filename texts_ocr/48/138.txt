Return on investments

The indicators for the return on investments are present-

ed, obtained as the relationship:

- for the net current return between interest and other
income, including income from financial instruments
at fair value through profit and loss (excluding income
from financial instruments related to linked contracts)
net of depreciation on real estate investments and the
average investments (calculated on book value);

- for the harvesting rate between net realized gains, net
impairment losses and realized and unrealized gains
and losses from financial instruments at fair value
through profit and loss (excluding those from financial
instruments related to linked contracts) and the aver-
age investments (calculated on book value).

The profit and loss return is equal to the current return

plus the harvesting rate net of investment management

expenses.

cluded land and buildings (investment properties), in-
vestments in subsidiaries, associated companies and

erage asset base of each quarter of the reporting period.

Consolidated investments

With regard to the presentation of consolidated invest-

ments, the following variations, with respect to the corre-

sponding balance sheet items have been implemented, in
order to provide the figures consistently with those used
to calculate the relative profitability:

— Investment Fund Units were split by nature between
equity, bond and investment property portfolios;

— derivatives are presented on a net basis, and therefore
also including derivative liabilities. Moreover, hedging
derivatives are classified in the respective asset class
hedged;

— reverse REPOs were reclassified, in accordance with
their nature of short-term liquidity commitments, from
Other fixed income instruments to Cash and cash
equivalents; and

- REPOs classified as liabilities are presented in Cash
and cash equivalents.

The segment investments were presented in accordance
with the methods described in the chapter Segment re-
porting of the Notes.
