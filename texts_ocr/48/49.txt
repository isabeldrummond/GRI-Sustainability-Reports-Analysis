Group shareholders’ equity and solvency

The shareholders’ equity attributable to the Group
amounted to € 23,601 million, a decrease of 5.9% com-
pared to € 25,079 million at 31 December 2017. The
change was mainly attributable to:

— the result of the period attributable to the Group, which
amounted to € 2,309 million at 31 December 2018;

— the dividend distribution of € 1,330 million, carried out
in 2018;

- other comprehensive income (€ -2,517) due to both the
reduction in the reserve for unrealized gains or losses
on available for sale financial assets of € -2,288 mil-
lion, mainly arising from the performance of bonds as
a result of expansion in spreads for the year, as well
as the reduction in the reserve attributable to disposal
groups of € -283 million, partially offset by the increase
in unrealized gains or losses for defined benefit plans
of € 81 million.

The Regulatory Solvency Ratio - which represents the
regulatory view of the Group's capital and is based on the
use of the internal model, solely for companies that have
obtained the relevant approval from IVASS, and on the
Standard Formula for other companies - stood at 216%
(207% at 31 December 2017; +9 pps). The trend was
mainly determined by the solid normalized generation
of capital and by the contribution of both the regulatory
changes in the model (including expansion of the internal
model to Austria and Switzerland) and the M&A activities
completed during the year, which more than offset the

negative economic variances of the period and the ex-
pected dividend distribution.

Starting from 31 December 2018, the Economic Solvency
Ratio, which represented the economic view of the
Group’s capital and was calculated by applying the inter-
nal model to the entire Group perimeter, will no longer be
published, as the difference between the regulatory and
economic view tapered with the reduction in the perim-
eter of entities still in the approval phase (Austria for the
health business and Spain).
