1. Risk identification

The purpose of the risk identification is to ensure that all
material risks to which the Group is exposed are proper-
ly identified. To this end, the Risk Management Function
interacts with the main Business Functions in order to
identify the main risks, assess their importance and en-
sure that adequate measures are taken to mitigate them
according to a sound governance process. Within this
process also emerging risks‘ related to new risks and de-
veloping trends, characterized by uncertain evolution and
often of systemic nature, are considered.

2. Risk measurement

Identified risks are then measured through their contri-
bution to the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR), com-
plemented by other modelling techniques deemed ap-
propriate and proportionate to better reflect the Group
risk profile. Using the same metric for measuring the
risks and the capital requirements ensures that each
risk is covered by an adequate amount of capital that
could absorb the loss incurred if the risk materializes.
For SCR calculation purposes 1 in 200 years events are
considered.

The SCR is calculated by means of the Group’s PIM®
for financial, credit, life and non-life underwriting risks.
Operational risks are measured by means of standard
formula, complemented by qualitative risk assessments.
The PIM provides an accurate representation of the main
risks to which the Group is exposed to, measuring not

only the impact of each risk taken individually but also
their combined impact on the Group’s Own Funds.

Group PIM methodology and governance are provided
in the section C. Solvency Position. Insurance and Re-
Insurance Entities not included in the PIM scope calcu-
late the capital requirement based on standard formula,
while Other Financial Services (e.g. banking or pension
funds) calculate the capital requirement based on their
own specific sectoral regimes.

Other risks, for which no SCR is calculated, such as li-
quidity, reputational, strategic, contagion, emerging and
additional Group specific risks (i.e. risks from intragroup
transactions, risk concentrations), are evaluated on the
basis of quantitative and qualitative techniques, models
and additional stress testing or scenario analysis.

3. Risk management and control

The risks which the Group is exposed to are managed on
the basis of the Group Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), de-
fined by the AMSB. The Group RAF defines the level of risk
the Group is willing to accept in conducting business and
thus provides the overall framework for embedding risk
management into business processes. In particular, the
RAF includes the statement of risk appetite, the risk prefer-
ences, the risk metrics, the tolerance and the target levels.

The purpose of the Group RAF is to set the desired level
of risk on the basis of the Group strategy. The Group RAF
statement is complemented by qualitative assertions (risk

3. The Risk Management Group Policy covers all Solvency II risk categories and, in order to adequately deal with each specific risk category and the underlying business processes,
is complemented by the following risk policies: Group Investment Governance Policy; P&C Underwriting and Reserving Group Policy; Life Underwriting and Reserving Group
Policy; Group Operational Risk Management Policy; Liquidity Risk Management Group Policy; other risk-related policies, such as Group Capital Management Policy, Supervisory
Reporting & Public Disclosure Group Policy, Group Risk Concentrations Management Policy etc.

5 The PIM use for the SCR calculation at Group level has been approved for the insurance entities in Italy, Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland as well as for the biggest Czech
company, Cesk pojigtovna a.s. For the other entities, the standard formula is applied. Other financially regulated entities apply local sectorial requirements.
