Fair Value measurement

IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement provides guidance on
fair value measurement and requires disclosures about
fair value measurements, including the classification of
financial assets and liabilities in the levels of fair value
hierarchy.

With reference to the investment, Generali Group meas-
ures financial assets and liability at fair value of in the
financial statements, or discloses it in the notes.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transac-
tion between market participants at the measurement
date (exit price). In particular, an orderly transaction
takes place in the principal or most advantageous mar-
ket at the measurement date under current market con-
ditions.

A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

(a) in the principal market for the asset or liability; or

(b) in the absence of a principal market, in the most ad-
vantageous market for the asset or liability.

The fair value is equal to market price if market informa-
tion are available (i.e. relative trading levels of identical
or similar instruments) into an active market, which is
defined as a market where the items traded within the
market are homogeneous, willing buyers and sellers can
normally be found at any time and prices are available to
the public.

If there isn’t an active market, it should be used a valu-
ation technique which however shall maximise the ob-
servable inputs.

If the fair value cannot be measured reliably, amortized
cost is used as the best estimate in determining the fair
value.

As for measurement and disclosure, the fair value de-
pends on its unit of account, depending on whether the
asset or liability is a stand-alone asset or liability, a group
of assets, a group of liabilities or a group of assets and
liabilities in accordance with the related IFRS.

The table below illustrates both the carrying amount and
the fair value of financial assets and liabilities recognised
in the balance sheet at 31 December 2018".

cost adjusted for any impairment losses for non-consolidated subsidiaries, was used as a reasonable proxy of their fair value.
