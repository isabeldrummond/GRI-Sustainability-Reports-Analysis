The cash generating units have been defined consist-
ently with IAS 36; with regard to the measurement of the
recovery value, of the cash generating unit (CGU) of Gen-
erali Italia, Alleanza Assicurazioni, Generali Deutschland
Holding, Generali CEE Holding Group, Generali Schweiz
Holding AG, Europ Assistance, Generali Holding Vienna
and Generali France the Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
has been used, as described in the basis of presentation
and accounting principles, for the determination of the
recovery value.

This method represents a variant of the method of cash
flows. In particular, the Excess Capital variant, defines
the entity’s economic value as the discounted dividend
maintaining an appropriate capital structure taking into
consideration the capital constraints imposed by the Su-
pervisor as the solvency margin. This method results in
the sum of discounted value of future dividends and the
cash generating unit terminal value.

The application of this criterion entailed in general the

following phases:

- explicit forecast of the future cash flows to be distrib-
uted to the shareholders in the planned time frame,
taking into account the limit due to the necessity of
maintaining an adequate capital level;

— calculation of the cash generating unit’s terminal value,
that was the foreseen value of the cash generating unit
at the end of the latest year planned.

The expected cash flows used in the analysis for each
CGU, were those detailed in the Strategic Plan 2019-
2021, presented to the Board of Directors in December
2018 and any significant subsequent events. In order
to extend the analysis horizon to a 5 years period, the
main economic and financial data were estimated for a
further two years (2022 and 2023). The net result (2022
and 2023) was calculated using a sustainable growth rate
for each CGU.
