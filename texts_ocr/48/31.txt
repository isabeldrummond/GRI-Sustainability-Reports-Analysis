Technological evolution

We are facing a profound change caused by the interaction
and the cumulative effects of various developments
in technology: Internet of Things, cloud services,
cognitive computing, advanced analytics, Robotic
Process Automation (RPA), artificial intelligence and
the development of mobile networks are elements that
contribute to creating a renewed environment in which
to operate in order to optimise efficiency, operations and
proximity with our customers. The spread of public and
context data, the progressive digitalisation of customers,
the growing appetite for personalised products, the
computing power available at low prices that doubles
one year after the next allow insurance companies to
transform their way of doing business and to step into

the so-called world of ecosystems, where the borderlines
between businesses at one time different and distinct are
becoming fainter and fainter in order to offer customers a
service in addition to a product.

Technological evolution also involves exponential growth
in cyber threats, such as attacks aimed at stealing
information or blocking operational processes. Adequate
management of this risk is therefore fundamental in order
to limit potential effects of economic and operational
nature but also to preserve, in particular, the confidence
of customers in the processing of their data which are
frequently sensitive. The issue is also increasingly
relevant for regulators which have introduced specific
safety measures as well as reporting processes in the
case of violation of the personal data (General Personal
Data Protection Regulation).

 

 

 

A

and our management

Data analysis is increasingly part of the DNA of the
Group’s production processes, from the systems for
improving fraud identification to personalisation of the
offer, from the automation of processes to anticipating
customers’ needs.

The formulations and analyses necessary for this new era
of customer relations are carried out - while guaranteeing
anonymity - both by the single business units on their
own and with the Group’s support through an analytical
platform. Consolidated in 2018, the platform now lets us
leverage synergies coming from the RPA and the cognitive
technologies, thus allowing increasingly complex
processes to be automated which increases quality and
efficiency. Nevertheless, in the perspective of ongoing
improvement we are continuing to scout platforms both
based on traditional integration technologies (API) and
the Blockchain/Distributed Ledger type that lead the way
to new digital ecosystems.

We are in step with the new technologies and are
protecting ourselves from the new threats. We are
continuing to enhance our ability to prevent, detect and
respond to potential cyber attacks while implementing

the most innovative security solutions and constantly
improving our response processes. More specifically, we
have set up a Security Operation Center (SOC) to monitor
all events recorded by our security solutions 24/7, detect
potential incidents and step in with containment and
restoration actions. SOC’s performance are monitored
in a structured manner through specific indicators, that
are not reported due to security reasons. In agreement
with the operational risk management model, we have
introduced an intervention assessment and prioritisation
framework supported by an IT tool available to our
countries. The Group governance model has also been
reinforced by defining a regulatory corpus concerning the
security of the information, in line with the major reference
standards (NIST, ISO 27001, etc.) and with the sector’s
best practices. Lastly, we are busy consolidating the
security ethos in the Group via many communication and
training initiatives, such as the publication of practical
advice for managing information security during one’s
work activity.

We are measuring operational risk following the regulatory
standards and with qualitative and quantitative models
that allow us to grasp our most important exposures and
to define the adequacy of the existing controls.
