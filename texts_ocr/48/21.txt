Confirming the centrality of people in the Group’s strategy, we held 8 meetings with the European Works Council -
he representative body for Group employees - at the permanent forum dedicated to social dialogue.

 

In line with the launch of a new strategic cycle and the new business priorities, in 2018 we developed the new
Generali People Strategy which will guide the Group’s priorities and initiatives in 2019-2021. The new Generali
People Strategy was defined through a co-creation process involving more than 400 of the Group’s people at
various organizational levels. The result was the definition of five lines of transformation:

— promote a culture of innovation, customer-centricity and inclusion;

- build and develop key competencies for the digital age;

— become a simple, agile and efficient organization;

— leverage excellence and the creation of sustainable value;

— favour the development of leaders and global talent.

These lines of transformation will be supported by specific global and local initiatives and targets defined and
monitored in line with the Generali 2021 strategic plan.

 

 

We have developed a framework for the assessment and management of operational risks inspired by international
best practices and consistent with the requirements of the Solvency II directive. As part of the assessment
conducted every year by the Group companies, the risks that could impact areas concerning our people were
identified and precisely analysed, and the initiatives implemented with a view to mitigating such risks were
evaluated. The areas of analysis regarded the following specific categories:

- employment relationships, with a particular focus on matters relating to key people and business ethics;

— safety at work;

- discrimination, diversity and inclusion.

The assessment is satisfactory also in light of the initiatives implemented within the Generali People Strategy
described and the centrality of our people within the Group strategy.
