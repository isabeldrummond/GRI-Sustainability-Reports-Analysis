— Guernsey

In July 2018, Generali has signed an agreement for the
sale of its investment in Generali Worldwide Insurance
Company Limited, located in Guernsey.

Pending the release of the necessary regulatory author-
isation, in accordance with IFRS 5, these activities were
classified as disposal group held for sale. As a result, this
investment was not excluded from consolidation, but
both the total assets and liabilities and the related profit
or loss, net of tax effects, have been recorded separately
in the specific lines of the financial statements.

The comparative data of the comprehensive income
statement and the cash flow statement have been restat-
ed. In line with this adjustment, also the tables related
to the statement of comprehensive income and the cash
flow statement have been restated.

The following tables show a condensed indication of the
balance sheet and income statement of discontinued op-
erations.
