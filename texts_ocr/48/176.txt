Deferred tax liabilities

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable tem-
porary differences between the carrying amount of as-
sets and liabilities and their tax base, Deferred tax liabil-
ities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to
be applied in the year when temporary differences will be
taxable, are based on the tax rates and tax laws enacted
or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside prof-
it or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred
tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying
transaction either in other comprehensive income or di-
rectly in equity.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are off-
set if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current
tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the
deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the
same taxation authority.

Deferred tax liabilities are not recognized in the following

cases provided for in paragraph 15 of IAS 12:

— When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial
recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a trans-
action that is not a business combination and, at the
time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting
profit nor taxable profit or loss

— In respect of taxable temporary differences associated
with investments in subsidiaries, associates and inter-
ests in joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal
of the temporary differences can be controlled and it
is probable that the temporary differences will not re-
verse in the foreseeable future.

Tax payables

The item includes payables due to tax authorities for cur-
rent taxes. Current income tax relating to items recog-
nised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in
the income statement.
