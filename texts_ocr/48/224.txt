The development of provisions for policies where the in-
vestment risk is borne by policyholders and for pension
funds highlights the development in the value of assets
backing unit/index linked policies, due to financial mar-
ket movements, only partially offset by the trend of net
inflow, and by change in perimeter.

The item ‘Transfer to Non-current assets or disposal
group classified as held for sale’ includes the technical

reserves of the companies held for sale, reclassified in
application of IFRS5.

The total insurance provisions include the gross di-
rect amount of mathematical provisions, which amount
to € 242,928 million (€278,521 million at 31 December
2017), the provisions for policies where the investment
risk is borne by the policyholders and for pension fund,
which amount to € 63,142 million (€ 67,989 million at 31
December 2017), the ageing provision for life segment,
which amounted to € 14,782 million (€ 13,782 million at 31
December 2017), and financial liabilities related to invest-
ment contacts, which amount to € 9,128 million (€ 13,382
million at 31 December 2017). It should be noted that the
significant decline in financial liabilities from investment
contracts is mainly attributable to change in perimeter.

The table above shows a shift of the exposures towards
‘less than 1%’ guarantee classes, due to the inflow of
new business with a guarantee of less than or equal to
zero. With reference to liabilities within more than 1%
guarantee classes, the strong shift compared to 2017 is
due to activities of Generali Leben classified as held for
sale, in application of IFRS5. Liabilities without guaran-
teed interest, normalized of the abovementioned effect,
amount to € 75,604 million in 2018, showing an increase
compared to the previous year (€ 74,203 million as at 31
December 2017 on a like-for-like basis), driven by the in-
crease in new unit-linked production.
