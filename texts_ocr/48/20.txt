Lastly, we promote a culture of inclusion which ascribes value to individuals and
diversity of all types, particularly with regard to four types of diversity: cultural, gender,
generational and disability. Our targets in terms of diversity and inclusion at Group level
have been revised with a view to supporting the new strategy, coming into line with
market best practices and collecting the points arising from continuous dialogue with
business leaders. The Group’s plan is joined by local plans developed on the basis of local
requirements.

Amongst the main Group actions, diversity and inclusion training has been reinforced

for the top international leaders. Particular focus has been dedicated to the topic of
unconscious bias, i.e., the unconscious stereotypes and prejudices that can guide
decisions with significant impacts on the business and people alike. The Group also
launched the #BeBoldForInclusion initiative, with the participation of more than 40

CEOs on 8 March, which provided the occasion for an effective awareness-raising and
promotion campaign with respect to Generali’s diversity and inclusion strategy, with

a particular focus on gender diversity. The initiative opened up dialogue on this topic,
collecting feedback from all employees.

These and many other activities were shared and supported by the Group D&l Council, led
by the Group D&l Sponsor Frédéric de Courtois, and consisting of business leaders acting
as D&l champions.

We develop the managerial skills of our leaders and talents to favour their
development and internal growth. To achieve this objective, we offer mentoring and
international training programmes in partnership with the best business schools in the
world.

To enhance strategic thinking and leadership skills, a number of ad hoc training

programmes were launched in 2018, including:

— Step Up, a 4-day residential programme at the Lausanne campus in collaboration with
IMD and dedicated to 70 Group Talent Directors. This initiative is intended to provide
the Group’s future leaders with the necessary leadership capabilities in the digital age;

— Global Mentoring Program, the third edition of which was launched in October 2018,
involving 82 participants including members of the Generali Leadership Group (GLG)
and young managers from throughout the Group. The Global Mentoring community
now consists of more than 200 people and the Group initiative paved the way for
multiple regional and local mentoring initiatives;

- Strategic Study Tour 2018, an immersive study tour in the ecosystem of Singapore on
the topic of digital innovation and business model transformation, supporting Generali
2021 strategic cycle planning and dedicated to a select group of 35 senior leaders.

The Group’s organization is a fundamental tool for ensuring the proper execution

of the strategy and the achievement of business objectives. Thus, we periodically
analyse the Group’s organizational structure to ensure that it is aligned with business
challenges. We believe in a clear and simple organizational model that is based on
shared rules, local empowerment and integration mechanisms. Furthermore, we
promote a new way of working which, also thanks to the use of technology, is efficient,
effective and capable of leveraging the organization’s collective intelligence. Within
this context, we support smart working, including through trade union agreements.
