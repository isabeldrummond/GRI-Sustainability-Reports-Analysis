Derivative financial instruments

The Group’s balance sheet exposure to derivative in-
struments is mainly associated with economic hedging
transactions of financial assets or liabilities, in line with
strategies aiming at mitigating financial and currency
risks. The total exposure amounts to € 409 million for a
corresponding notional amount of € 39,430 million. The
notional exposure is presented in absolute amounts, in-
cluding positions with both positive and negative balanc-
es, and it arises for an amount of € 8,172 million from
instruments for which a hedge accounting relationship
has been formally designated, in accordance with the
international accounting standard IAS 39. The remaining
notional amount is attributable to derivative instruments
for which, notwithstanding their purpose as economic
hedging instruments, a formal hedge accounting rela-
tionship has not been activated.

The cash flow hedging relationships mainly relate to cross
currency swaps hedging subordinated liabilities issued
by the Group in British pound and to micro-hedge and re-
investment risk reduction operations in the life portfolios

— Hedge of net investment in foreign operations

The Group continued the hedging strategy aimed at neu-
tralising risks arising from foreign exchange fluctuations
of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Swiss
franc, Czech crowns and British pound.

Other derivative instruments

The recognised amounts in the financial statements for
these exposures at 31 December 2018 amounted to € 593
million for a corresponding notional amount of € 31,257
million, which mainly relates to over-the-counter positions.
The exposure is mainly associated with operations relat-
ing to interest rates hedges and foreign exchange rates
hedges. Furthermore the Group undertakes macro hedge
strategies aimed at protecting the capital and the income
statement from the risk of a significant reduction in share
prices.

In general, in order to mitigate the credit risk arising from
over-the-counter transactions, the Group collateralises
most of them. Furthermore, a list of selected authorised
counterparties is identified for the opening of new deriva-
tive transactions.

designated as hedge accounting and other derivative in-
struments.
