In particular, the distinction between operating and finan-
cial leases is eliminated for what concerns the lessee ac-
counting: all leases require the recognition of a lease as-
set, which represents the right-of-use of the leased asset
for the lease term, and a lease liability, which represents
the obligation to pay rent payments. The accounting
treatment of leases is unchanged for the lessor.

During 2018 the Group performed an impact assessment
on the application of IFRS 16, with particular focus on
Group Companies acting as lessees.

The Group does not estimate material impacts on share-
holders’ equity deriving from the application of the re-
quirements of the new standard compared to the current
rules of IAS 17. However, an increase of assets and lia-
bilities is expected, deriving from the new accounting of
operating leases for lessees. Moreover, expenses for op-
erating lease payments will be split into two components:
depreciation of right of use assets and interest expenses
on lease liabilities. The final impact of the application of
new IFRS 16 at first time adoption will be linked to the
scope of lease contracts as at 1 January 2019 (in par-
ticular those with remaining lease term of more than 12
months), and market conditions which will impact the de-
termination of discount rates for the calculation of lease
liabilities and consequently right of use assets at initial
recognition.

On first time adoption of the standard, the Group will

adopt the simplified retrospective approach, choosing on
a lease-by-lease basis to measure the right of use asset

at an amount equal to the lease liability (eventually ad-
justed by any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating
to the lease recognised in the statement of financial po-
sition immediately before the date of initial application).
The cumulative effect of initial application of the princi-
ple, even if estimated by the Group as almost nil, will be
accounted for as an adjustment of the opening balance
of retained earnings.

In applying IFRS 16, the Group will adopt the simplified
accounting treatment for short-term leases and low-value
leases which allows lessees not to recognise any amount
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements, but
only to recognise expenses for lease payments.

In the course of the ordinary business, the Group compa-
nies normally enter into leasing agreements as lessees.
Mentioned agreements are mainly related to use of real
estates used for business, company cars and office fur-
niture and equipment. In some cases Group companies
acts also as lessor, mainly related to real estates rental
through operating lease.

As at 31 December 2018, the Group undiscounted fu-
ture minimum lease payments under operating leases
for Group lessees amounted to around € 750 min. The
Group expects increase of assets and liabilities due to
new leasing accounting rules in range of approximately
this amount.

The new standard will be effective starting from financial
years starting from 1 January 2019.
