| 62 | Generali Group Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

 

 

 

Austria, CEE and Russia

 

The new ACEER regional structure is the fourth most important market for Generali,
in which the Group has strengthened its presence up to becoming one of the top
insurance companies of the entire area. Twelve nations fall within the ACEER scope:
Austria (At), Czech Republic (Cz), Poland (Pl), Hungary (Hu), Slovakia (Sk), Serbia,
Montenegro, Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and the recent Russia Regional
Office.

The Group can boast its presence in the Eastern Europe territories since 1989. In 2008,
a joint venture collaboration with PPF Holding started and ended in 2015, the year in
which Generali acquired full control and powers over Generali CEE Holding.

Two important entities entered the area in 2018: Austria, where Generali has been pres-
ent since 1832, the year after the company’s foundation in Trieste, and Russia, where
Generali is expanding. Generali reinforced its competitive and income position last year
thanks to the acquisition of Adriatic Slovenica, in this way becoming the number two
insurance group in Slovenia, and Concordia Insurance together with Concordia Polska
Tuw in Poland, and to the bancassurance agreement with Unicredit for the distribution
of insurance solutions mainly related to Credit Protection Insurance (CPI) in the whole
region.

The Group also takes top rankings in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Serbia, Austria
and Slovakia, and among the top ten in the other countries. In terms of volumes,
on the other hand, main insurance markets are Austria, Czech Republic, Poland,
Hungary and Slovakia. The contribution of the minor markets has improved during
the last years, resulting in an increase of the premium income on the total volume of
the area.

Generali is also leader in terms of technical profitability thanks to a medium-long term
net combined ratio at around 90%.

With reference to the financial markets, the good macroeconomic performance, and par-
ticularly that of the labour market, bringing about increased inflation, continued in 2018
in the Czech Republic, the most important Eastern European country. As a result, the
Czech National Bank raised the reference interest rate from 0.5% to 1.75%. The Czech
Koruna marginally depreciated (1%) against the euro during the year.

In Austria, GDP went up and the labour market performed well. The ten-year Austrian
bond yield closed 2018 at 0.5% (0.6% at year-end 2017).

In Life segment premiums, there was a decline in savings products (-2.1%, linked to the
performance of regular premium policies), followed by a decline in unit-linked products
(-1.8%, mainly due to the decline in single premium policies), only partially offset by
the positive performance of the protection lines (+9.1%). This trend is explained by the
slowdown in premiums in the Czech Republic (-2.2% due to the continued decline in
new savings products production mainly in Ceska Pojistovna) and in Poland (-4.3% due
to the decline in individual unit-linked products), offset by a growth in volumes in the
rest of the region and especially in Slovakia (+8% due to the protection lines), Austria
(+1.6% benefiting from the boost of Health products), as well as Romania (+69.5%, as
a result of protection products launched as of July 2018 through the partnership with
Unicredit) and Serbia (+15.3% supported by the growth in savings products following
the renewals initiatives).

The new business in terms of present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) in-
creased slightly (+1.8%), with growth in both single premiums (+3.9%) and the present
value of future annual premiums (+0.8%).

Countries that provided the greatest contributed to the observed increase are Austria
(+1.0%) and Hungary (+33,4%), which offset the decline recorded in the remaining
countries (specifically, in Poland, the decline was 7.9%).
