Long Term Incentive Plan

On 12 April 2018, the General Shareholders’ Meeting of
Banca Generali approved a new long-term incentive plan
for the Banking Group’s top management based exclu-
sively on Banca Generali S.p.A. shares (LTI Plan 2018).

The new plan presents characteristics similar to those of
the plans that the parent company Assicurazioni Generali
activates yearly and are based on the allotment of its own
shares. However, this plan is mainly aimed at increasing
the value of Banca Generali shares, by strengthening the
link between the remuneration of beneficiaries and per-
formance of the Banking Group, without prejudice to the
consistency required with the expected results set forth
in the Insurance Group's strategic plan.

In light of the above, the new incentivisation plan calls for:

1.allotment to the beneficiaries of Banca Generali shares
acquired on the market instead of Assicurazioni Gen-
erali shares directly allotted by the latter;

2.increased weight of the Banking Group’s objectives,
equal to 80%.

The key characteristics of the plan are as follows:

— the maximum number of the shares to be allotted is de-
termined at the beginning of the period of reference us-
ing a multiplier of the beneficiary's current remuneration*
and is divided into three notional instalments, respec-
tively referring to each of the three years of the plan;

&

beneficiaries.
5 The access gate conditions consist of:

- once it has been determined that the access gate®
conditions of the Banking Group and of the Insurance
Group have been met, Banca Generali’s Board of Di-
rector assesses the attainment of the targets set for the
three-year period and determined the exact number of
shares that can potentially be allotted for the year in
question;

- at the end of the three-year period, after having as-
sessed that the access gate conditions have been met,
the total number of shares accrued are paid in one
tranche through the free granting to the beneficiaries of
own ordinary shares, repurchased on the market (stock
granting), provided that the beneficiary’s work relation-
ship with one of the Banking Group companies is still in
force (service condition);

— 50% of the shares allotted vest immediately upon al-
lotment, whereas the remaining 50% do not vest for an
additional two years®;

— the plan does not include dividend equivalent mecha-
nisms, in accordance with the law and common prac-
tice in the banking sector.

The targets triggering accrual of the incentive are broken

down into:

— two Banking Group targets (ROE and EVA), weighting
for 80% on the overall bonus;

— two Insurance Group targets (Operating ROE and rTSR
— relative Total Shareholders’ Return compared to a
Peer Group), weighting for the remaining 20%.

The potential maximum bonus to be paid in shares corresponds to 175% of the gross annual remuneration of the plan participants for top managers and to 87.5% for other

> two indicators representing the specific access thresholds for the Banking Group tied to the Total Capital Ratio and Liquidity Capital Ratio, on which the right to allotment of

the shares (100%) is contingent;

> an indicator representing an access threshold for the Generali Group linked to the Regulatory Solvency Ratio, on which the right to the allotment of the part of the shares tied

to the satisfaction of the Generali Group Objectives (20%) is contingent.
