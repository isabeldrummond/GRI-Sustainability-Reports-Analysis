The net investment result, amounting to € 1,835 mil-
lion, was down (-12.6%) from the € 2,098 million at 31
December 2017.

This trend was, in particular, determined by the reduction

in net income from investments, impacted by an increase

in impairments and a drop in the realized component. In
particular:

— current income from investments - which also include
the current income from investments at fair value
through profit or loss - was down at € 9,518 million
(€ 9,682 million at 31 December 2017), while the related
profitability, calculated based on the book value of the
investments, was down to 3.1%;

— net operating realized gains on investments stood at
€ 1,220 million (€ 1,558 million at 31 December 2017)
against a general decline in realized gains on all asset
classes, deriving in part from planned Asset & Liability
Management operations;

— net operating impairment losses on investments went
from € -266 million at 31 December 2017 to € -817

million. This trend mainly reflected the impairments on
equity securities following the negative market perfor-
mance in the last year;

- other operating net financial expense, which includes
interest expense on liabilities linked to operating activi-
ties and investment management expenses, amounted
to € -931 million (€ -870 million at 31 December 2017).

The net income from financial assets and liabilities related
to unit and index-linked contracts fell from € 3,849 mil-
lion at 31 December 2017 to € -5,834 million. This trend
reflected the change in the value of investments caused
by a rise in spreads on corporate bonds and the negative
performance of some equity markets compared to the
corresponding period of the previous year.

The policyholders’ interests on operating income from

own investments rose from € -11,508 million at 31

December 2017 to € -807 million, mainly due to the relat-

ed decrease in income from financial instruments at fair

value through profit or loss related to linked contracts.
