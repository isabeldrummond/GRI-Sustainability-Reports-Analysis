The Property & Casualty gross written premiums reached
€ 20,607 million, growing by 3.3%, thanks to the positive
performance of both business lines.

The 3.4% growth in the motor business is attributable to
the growth observed in ACEER (+5.7%), France (+4.2%)
and in the Americas and Southern Europe region (+19.2%),
reflecting the tariff adjustments implemented in Argentina
following inflation. In spite of a recovery in the second half
of the year, motor premium income in Italy was down by
1.7%, following the contraction of the portfolio as a result
of measures adopted to restore portfolio profitability.

Non-motor premium income also grew (+2.7%), with pos-
itive trends broadly extended across the Group’s various
areas of operations. Premiums increased in the ACEER
region (+4.1%) with diversified growth in the territory,
France (+2.7%), Germany (+1.8%) and in the International
cluster (+ 7.2%), driven by Europ Assistance and Spain.
The decrease observed in Italy (-1.5%) persisted, related
to the reduction of the Global Corporate & Commercial
lines as well as in the A&H line, which reflected strong
competition in a market characterized by sustained price
competition.
