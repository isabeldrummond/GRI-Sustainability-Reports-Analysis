Other liabilities

This item includes provisions for defined benefit plans,
such as termination benefit liabilities and other long-term
employee benefits (the Italian provision for “trattamento
di fine rapporto” is excluded and classified as other pay-
ables). In compliance with IAS 19, these provisions are
measured according to the project unit credit method.
This method implies that the defined benefit liability is
influenced by many variables, such as mortality, employ-
ee turnover, salary trends, expected inflation, expected
rate of return on investments, etc. The liability recognised
in the balance sheet represents the net present value of
the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan
assets (if any), adjusted for any actuarial gains and losses
and any past service costs not amortised. The rate used
to discount future cash flows is determined by reference
to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds. The
actuarial assumptions are periodically tested to confirm
their consistency. The actuarial gains and losses arising
from subsequent changes in variables used to make es-
timates are recognised shall be accounted for in other
comprehensive income without any possibility of recy-
cling to profit and loss.

Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018

Deferred fee and commission income includes acqui-
sition loadings related to investment contracts without
DPF, which are classified as financial liabilities at fair val-
ue through profit or loss, according to IAS 39.

Acquisition loadings related to these products are ac-
counted for in accordance with IAS 18 treatment of the
investment management service component during the
product life. They are recognised by reference to the
stage of completion of the service rendered.

Therefore, the acquisition commissions have been reclas-
sified in the balance sheet, as liabilities to be released to
the profit and loss account during the life of the product.
