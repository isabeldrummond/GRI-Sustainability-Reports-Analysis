41 Additional information on level 3

The amount of financial instruments classified in Level 3
represents 2.5% of total financial assets and liabilities at
fair value, slightly increasing compared to 31 December
2017 mainly due to change in perimeter.

Generally, the main inputs used in valuation techniques
are volatility, interest rates, yield curves, credit spreads,
dividend estimates and exchange rates.

The more significant assets classified within Level 3 are
the following:

— Unquoted equities

It includes unquoted equity securities, mainly classified
into available for sale. Their fair value is determined us-
ing the valuation methods described above or based on
the net asset value of the company. These contracts are
valued individually using appropriate input depending on
the security and therefore neither a sensitivity analysis
nor an aggregate of unobservable inputs used would be
indicative of the valuation.

In addition, for certain securities the amortized cost is
considered to be a reasonable proxy for fair value, and
does not therefore apply a sensitivity analysis.

— IFU funds, private equity and hedge funds

It includes unquoted IFU funds, private equity and hedge
funds, which are classified into available for sale and fair
value through profit or loss. Their fair value is substantial-
ly provided by the fund administrators on the basis of the
net asset value of the fund. The fair value of these invest-
ments is closely monitored by a team of professionals
inside the Group.

line basis sensitive to changes in the value of the underly-

ing assets, the Group considers that, for a given change
in the fair value of the underlying of such assets, their
value undergoes a similar variation.

fer to the section Investments in the Notes.

- Bonds

Are corporate bonds, classified into available for sale
and fair value through profit or loss. Their fair value
is mainly determined based on the market or income
approach. In terms of sensitivity analysis any chang-
es in the inputs used in the valuation do not cause a
significant impact on the fair value at the Group level
considering the lack of materiality of these securities
classified in level 3.

Moreover, given the analyses described above, the
Group has decided to classify all the asset-backed se-
curities items in Level 3 considering that their evalua-
tion is generally not corroborated by market inputs. For
what regards prices provided by providers or counter-
parties, bonds for which it is not possible to replicate
the price using market inputs have been classified in
Level 3. Therefore, given the lack of information con-
cerning the inputs used for the determination of the
price, the Group is not able to perform a sensitivity
analysis on this bonds.

— Financial assets where the investment risk is borne by
the policyholders and related to pension funds

Their fair value is determined using the valuation meth-
ods and observations on sensitivity analysis and input
described above.

struments measured at fair value and classified as level
3.
