Provisions for taxation 75 89

Other provisions 1,125 1,249

Provisions for commitments and other provisions include
provisions for corporate restructuring, litigation or similar
events as well as other commitments for which, at balance
sheet date, an outflow of resources to settling the related
obligation is considered probable and reliably estimated.
In particular, the increase in ‘Other provisions’ is mainly
attributable to provisions for restructuring in Germany.

The amounts recognized in the financial statements rep-
resents the best estimate of their value. In particular, in
the assessment all the peculiarities of the specific pro-
visions are taken into account, including the effective
period of incurrence of the contingent liabilities and con-
sequently the expected cash flows on the different esti-
mates and assumptions.

The table below summarized the main changes occurred during the period:

In the normal course of business, the Group may enter
into arrangements that do not lead to the recognition of
those commitments as assets and liabilities in the con-
solidated financial statements under IFRS (contingent
assets and liabilities). For further information regarding
contingent liabilities please refer to the paragraph Con-
tingent liabilities, commitments, guarantees, pledged
assets and collaterals in Additional information.

With reference to the main outstanding litigation pro-
ceedings, it should be noted that during 2016 Gener-
ali received from Banco BTG Pactual S.A. requests for
damages, by means of a notice arbitration, as provided
by the Share and Purchase Agreement of BSI S.A.. In
this regard, the following main developments are sum-
marised with respect to those already reported in previ-
ous financial statements.

On 5 October 2018, Banco BTG Pactual SA filed a further
brief in which it reiterated its claims for damages arising,
according to the counterparty, on the alleged violation of
the representations, warranties and covenants assumed
by the seller in the context of the sale of BSI S.A..

Within the deadline set by the Arbitral Tribunal, Generali
then filed further briefs in which it reiterated the firm ob-
jection, both in fact and in law, of the opposing claims,
reiterating the preliminary exceptions raised.

Taking into account the status of the arbitration pro-
ceeding and the legal opinions acquired in this regard,
it is considered that the conditions of probability and
ability to make a reliable estimate that are required by
IAS 37 to make any provisions for risks related to the
abovementioned request for damages are not met.
