Provisions

Provisions for risks and charges are provided only when
it is deemed necessary to respond to an obligation (legal
or implicit) arising from a past event and it is probable
that an outflow of resources whose amount can be relia-
bly estimated, as required by IAS 37.

Insurance provisions

This item comprises amounts, gross of ceded reinsur-
ance, of liabilities related to insurance contracts and in-
vestment contracts with discretionary participation fea-
tures.

Life insurance policies

In accordance with IFRS 4, policies of the life segment
are classified as insurance contracts or investment con-
tracts based on the significance of the underlying insur-
ance risk.

Classification requires the following steps:

— identification of the characteristics of products (option,
discretionary participation feature, etc.) and services
rendered;

— determination of the level of insurance risk in the con-
tract; and

— application of the international principle.

Insurance contracts and investment contracts
with DPF

Premiums, payments and change in the insurance provi-
sion related to products whose insurance risk is consid-
ered significant (e.g. term insurance, whole life and en-
dowment with annual premiums, life contingent annuities
and contracts containing an option to elect at maturity a
life contingent annuity at rates granted at inception, long-
term health insurance and unit-linked with sum assured
in case of death significantly higher than the value of the
fund) or investment contracts with discretionary partici-
pation feature -DPF — (e.g. policies linked to segregated
funds, contracts with additional benefits that are con-
tractually based on the economic result of the compa-
ny) are accounted for in accordance with previous local
GAAP. Gross premiums are recognised as a revenue, net
of cancellations of the period, and ceded premiums are
recognised as expenses of the period.

Shadow accounting

In order to mitigate the valuation mismatch between fi-
nancial investments carried at fair value according to IAS
39 and insurance provisions which are accounted for in
accordance with previous local GAAP, shadow account-
ing is applied to insurance contracts and investments
contracts with DPF. This accounting practice attributes
to the policyholders part of the difference between IAS/
IFRS valuation of the basis on which the profit sharing is
determined and valuation which is used to determine the
profit sharing actually paid. This accounting treatment is
included in the deferred policyholder liabilities in the life
insurance provisions.

The policyholders’ share is calculated on the average
contractual percentage for the policyholder participation,
as the local regulation already foresees the protection of
guaranteed obligations through the recognition of addi-
tional provisions for interest rate risk if future financial re-
turns based on a proper time horizon are not sufficient to
cover the financial guaranties included in the contract.

The accounting item arising from the shadow accounting
application is included in the carrying amount of insur-
ance liabilities whose adequacy is tested by the liability
adequacy test (LAT) according to IFRS 4 (refer to para-
graph Details on insurance and investment contracts), to
rectify the IAS/IFRS carrying amount of insurance provi-
sions.

The main accounting effect of the shadow accounting
is double fold: on the one hand, the recognition of the
policyholders’ share of unrealized gains and losses on
available for sale financial assets in the deferred poli-
cyholders’ liabilities; on the other, the insurer’s share is
recognised in equity. If financial instruments are fair val-
ued through profit or loss or financial investments are
impaired, the policyholders’ share on the difference be-
tween the market value and valuation used to determine
the return which the profit sharing is based on (e.g. the
carrying amount in segregated fund) is recognised in the
profit and loss account. The shadow accounting also al-
lows the recognition of an insurance liability related to
unrealized gains on available for sale financial assets
linked to contracts with discretionary participation fea-
ture, up to the amount of the increase in value of these
assets due to the change of market rates.
