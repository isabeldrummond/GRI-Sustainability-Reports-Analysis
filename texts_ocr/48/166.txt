Contractual relations with customers -
insurance contracts acquired in a business
combination or portfolio transfer

In case of acquisition of life and non-life insurance con-
tract portfolios in a business combination or portfolio
transfer, the Group recognises an intangible asset, i.e.
the value of the acquired contractual relationships (Value
Of Business Acquired). The VOBA is the present value of
the pre-tax future profit arising from the contracts in force
at the purchase date, taking into account the probability
of renewals of the one year contracts in the non-life seg-
ment. The related deferred taxes are accounted for as
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

The VOBA is amortised over the effective life of the con-
tracts acquired, by using an amortization pattern reflect-
ing the expected future profit recognition. Assumptions
used in the development of the VOBA amortization
pattern are consistent with the ones applied in its initial
measurement. The amortization pattern is reviewed on a
yearly basis to assess its reliability and, if applicable, to
verify the consistency with the assumptions used in the
valuation of the corresponding insurance provisions.

The difference between the fair value of the insurance
contracts acquired in a business combination or a port-
folio transfer, and the insurance liabilities measured in
accordance with the acquirer’s accounting policies for
the insurance contracts that it issues, is recognised as
intangible asset and amortised over the period in which
the acquirer recognises the corresponding profits.

The Generali Group applies this accounting treatment to
the insurance liabilities assumed in the acquisition of life
and non-life insurance portfolios.

The future VOBA recoverable amount is nonetheless
tested on yearly basis.

As for as the life and non-life portfolios, the recoverable
amount of the value of the in force business acquired is
carried out through the liability adequacy test (LAT) of
the insurance provisions — mentioned in the paragraph
related to life and non-life insurance provisions— taking
into account, if any, the deferred acquisition costs recog-
nised in the balance sheet. If any, the impairment losses
are recognised in the profit or loss account and cannot
be reversed in a subsequent period.

Similar criteria are applied for the initial recognition, the
amortization and the impairment test of other contrac-
tual relationships arising from customer lists of asset
management sector, acquired in a business combination
where the acquiree belongs to the financial segment.

Tangible assets

This item comprises land and buildings used for own ac-
tivities and other tangible assets.

Land and buildings (self-used)

In accordance with IAS 16, this item includes land and
buildings used for own activities.

Land and buildings (self-used) are measured applying the
cost model set out by IAS 16. The cost of the self-used
property comprises purchase price and any directly at-
tributable expenditure.

The depreciation is systematically calculated applying
specific economic/technical rates which are determined
locally in accordance with the residual value over the
useful economic life of each individual component of the
property

Land and buildings (self-used) are measured at cost less
any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Land and agricultural properties are not depreciated but
periodically tested for impairment losses. Costs, which
determine an increase in value, in the functionality or in
the expected useful life of the asset, are directly charged
to the assets to which they refer and depreciated in ac-
cordance with the residual value over the assets’ use-
ful economic life. Cost of the day-to-day servicing are
charged to the profit and loss account.

Finance leases of land and buildings are accounted for in
conformity with IAS 17 and require that the overall cost
of the leasehold property is recognised as a tangible
asset and, as a counter-entry, the present value of the
minimum lease payments and the redemption cost of the
asset are recognised as a financial liability.
