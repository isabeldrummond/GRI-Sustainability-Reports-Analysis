VISION, MISSION, VALUES

The mission and core values of Pegaso and Schwabe are particularly similar
and this provides a solid base for the merger process.

@ PEGASO.

e want to help create a world where health
is a conscious choice that respects and is in
harmony with life sources.

These individual choices begin with diet, lifestyle
and mental attitude towards our bodies.

We place people at the heart of all this with
our comprehensive and integrated vision, and
through various treatment methods we can help
people to maintain or recover _ their
psychological and physical wellness (or to stay
well).

Research, Training, Communication and
Education are the four key words that guide our
choices.

We have shared seven values we use as
reference to generate coherent behaviours and
to guide us in our daily decisions. They were
developed through the engagement of the
company owners, internal employees and some
external collaborators.
