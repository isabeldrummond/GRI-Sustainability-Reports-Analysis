PROMOTION AND EDUCATION

Ou, commitment to promoting wellbeing manifests itself not only through our
products but also through sharing and growing our culture of “Here's another
way to wellbeing”, a way that starts with taking responsibility for our own health

Priteat and self-awareness.
ibiieterwt \We consider this activity to be strategic because by expanding the culture
and knowledge of health-related topics, we automatically boost the ability
4 of all those in the supply chain downstream (physicians, trade, consumers) to
make informed choices, which increases interest in the product and in turn
TARGET 3.8 expands the market. Offering a quality product also means investing in quality
communications.

 

Promotion focuses on two fronts:

 
      
   

The
“SCIENTIFIC”
front targeting
professionals and
health operators

The
“EDUCATIONAL”

front targeting final
consumers.

 

These actions are both strategic and all about sustainability for us because
they offer content and value that goes beyond the product, for the good of
the user

Building valuable relationships with Universities and Academic Institutions is
essential for our sector, because it leverages innovation and boosts the
company’s standing. Although we do not have a written policy for management
of relations with scientific and academic partners, we devote time and
resources to maintaining these initiatives, which fall under the remit of our
Scientific Division and Marketing Division.
