COMPANY CANTEEN SERVICE: the arrival at headquarters of new colleagues
from the Egna facility made it necessary to organise a company canteen service.
The company thus began a collaboration with the Azalea Cooperative, a local
organisation which works for the greater good of the community. The preparation
of meals and growing of vegetables is entrusted to disadvantaged people who
need help to get back into the workplace.
