Presence in the Governing Council to play an active role within the
association and support the evolution of our sector The association actively
works with institutions to valorise the supplements category and give the food

Local Communities - Bodies

The parameters we use to decide which cultural or social projects to
participate in are the social and territorial context (although some associations
are national), alignment with our Mission or affinity with our target users. We
support some non-profit bodies and associations through financial donations,
and other associations through product donations.

 

eee} Children’s shelter in Nepal: donation of 1467 pieces of probiotics for
poor and abused children, thanks to our contact with a doctor working to
provide assistance in the area.

***=> Company welfare and the local area- alliance for families: we were
invited to participate as an example of local excellence due to our welfare
actions for our employees.
