WE GENERATE AND DISTRIBUTE
A RESPONSIBLE VALUE

d) n 2019 we created value through the production and sale of products, and
this value is distributed primarily in Italy. Compared to 2018, overall revenues
were down by 11.7% following changes made to the commercial structure, the
termination of a number of agency contracts for representatives, changes to
our medical target group and updated marketing strategies for products with
the new Schwabe Pharma management.
