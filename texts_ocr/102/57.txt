WATER

lyfe use 100% water from public sources primarily for office utilities and

softener for the water supply, which operates constantly, removing calcium from

excluded are those for watering the garden.

 

 

As we do not use water for production processes but for sanitation only,
waste water is not recycled nor is it reused or metered.

The table shows an annual increase in the amount, attributable to various
factors:

company canteen service.

For 2020, we have decided to base reporting directly on the water meter
reading, as the water utility bill lacks transparency due to the inclusion of
adjustments and rebates.

as well as a further increase in the number of sales of larger size packs; the latter

handled. From analysis of these data, it is clear that the high-impact elements

generated by the latter, and this prompts even greater care in the choices w
