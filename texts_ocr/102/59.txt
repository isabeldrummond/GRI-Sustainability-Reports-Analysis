WASTE DISPOSAL

Outsourcing production to third parties, our waste production is limited to
non-manufacturing activities, however we constantly monitor waste from our
headquarters and warehouse.

We collect and analyse data relating to product disposal to optimise stock
rotation and avoid unnecessary destruction.

The goal is to reduce the impact on the environment and reduce waste.

EXTERNAL RESPONSIBILITY.

For disposal of expired, unsellable or damaged products, we work with certified
bodies using a certified disposal procedure: the logistics provider sends us
a certificate for the waste disposal in compliance with regulations.

> INTERNAL RESPONSIBILITY.

The type of waste produced by the headquarters does not involve
hazardous substances but separated materials. We recorded an increase
in organic waste attributable to the introduction of fruit under the project "Here's
another way to wellbeing at work". The use of glasses for drinking favoured a
reduction in plastic waste. There was a slight increase in dry waste and waste
paper. As a result of the products and paper materials warehouse being
relocated to Egna, and the new method of management of these products,
large numbers of charts, brochures and guides were disposed of
