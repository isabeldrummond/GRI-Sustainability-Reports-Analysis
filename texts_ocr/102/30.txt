Following the sale of the company, a new organisation chart was drawn up
detailing changes in the roles, responsibilities and job descriptions of
Pegaso employees in the light of the merger with Schwabe Pharma Italia,
with its departments and workforce. This has had an impact on:

© Travel between the two sites necessary for work activities and
integration of personnel.

© Use of car-pooling to optimise transport and reduce the number of
car joumneys.

© Reorganisation of existing offices to accommodate new colleagues.

© Creation of a new, larger meeting room for BoD, management and
departmental meetings.

© Implementation of video conference systems for teleworkers and smart
working between the different sites.

To help the two groups to become acquainted and promote good relations
from the outset, three different light-hearted social gatherings (lunches and
dinners) were organised in the two sites at Aroizzano and Egna.

The IT department was tasked with sharing computer data to align it with the
system requested by headquarters, and with restructuring the email system. The
changes to the IT infrastructure affected the tools used as well as employees’
working methods.

In addition, the commercial network of agents and medical representatives was
completely reorganised with changes to areas and types of contract which, in
some cases, led to the termination of work contracts with long-standing medical
representatives and agents.

 

 

EMPLOYEE TRAINING.

Technical, multidisciplinary training is sustained in order to increase expertise
and maintain a suitable level of knowledge to respond to corporate and
market requirements.

A significant share of the 2019 budget was provided using Veneto Region
tenders and free courses, including training by trade organisations.

Smart Working training was rolled out to all employees in order to develop new
skills, strategies, individual and company reorganisation, to allow employees to
have access to work away from home.
