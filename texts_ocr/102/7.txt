ENSURE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE QUALITY EDUCATION AND PROMOTE LIFELONG
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL.

We invest every year in technical and interdisciplinary training for
employees and collaborators. We recognise that this impacts on knowledge
and expertise, improving productivity and efficiency, while also rewarding
employees by giving them the opportunity to access valuable educational
content.

ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY AND EMPOWER ALL WOMEN AND GIRLS.

We are a company with a predominantly female workforce, and a female
approach to business, product development, personnel management and the
life-work balance.

PROMOTE INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH, EMPLOYEMENT AND
DECENT WORK FOR ALL.

We are aware of our role as a company and the contribution we make to the
social-economic sector in the province of Verona.

The company's success has a positive impact on the sector in terms of
economic growth, the use of resources and development. We offer all our
employees decent working conditions and we are attuned to their needs.

We are also attentive to our suppliers, complying with all employment laws.

 

ENSURE SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION PATTERNS

We are acutely aware of our waste, our annual consumption of materials
and the fact that third parties generate a greater environmental footprint than
the Pegaso headquarters alone. We study the market in depth in order to
produce the right amount of products without generating waste; we create
products with limited packaging to help people achieve their health objectives
with fewer negative external factors.

The Sustainability Report is a useful document to measure Our environmental,
social and economic performance, to become increasingly responsible in terms
of manufacturing and to encourage responsible consumption patterns among
clients and final users.

 

 

 

 

STRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND REVITALISE THE GLOBAL
PARTNERSHIP FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.

We share our keen interest in sustainability and sustainable development with
our stakeholders. Moreover, on more than one occasion, we have measured
the environmental and social performance of certain suppliers, influencing their
sustainable decisions and actions.
