EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES.
Our team today consists of 26 employees and 5 members of the BoD, 34% of
whom are male and the remaining 66% female.

As of June, the BoD consists of 3 male administrators and 2 female directors.

Our “Supporters Group” consists of 3 women with the support of 1 external
consultant.

Despite having a largely female workforce (66%) and practising no salary
distinctions between men and women on the same level of work contract, the
average pay is 27% higher for male employees compared to their female
counterparts. This is because the majority of male employees are at
management level, with considerable seniority and full-time positions, as
illustrated by the table of employees on pg. 18.

This has also had an impact on the pay gap between the maximum and
minimum salary for the same number of hours, raising it from 3.40 to 3.65.
