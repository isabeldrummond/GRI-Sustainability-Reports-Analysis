COMPLETENESS.
All selected topics and respective indicators have been addressed completely; where this

has not been possible, an explanation is offered for the incompleteness, reiterating the
company's commitment to complete them in the future.

 

The “Supporters Group” has endeavoured to include evaluation of the

indeed no substantial changes were made during the three-year reporting
period.
