NATURALLY RESPONSIBLE

lyfe are a manufacturing company, although we outsource actual production of
our products to third parties.
This means designing them, formulating them, selecting the raw materials
and defining quality criteria with our production partners.
We also define positioning, marketing and communication strategies.
These actions have a relatively low environmental impact compared to
enterprises that develop the production process.
The pharmaceutical structures used for production follow specific environmental
certifications, however awareness of the wider topic of sustainability remains
limited, so it is difficult to collect data and measure the impacts of our
production.
We know that the materials used for packaging have an effect on the health of
final users and on the environment; they ensure the quality and the efficacy of
the product itself.
In this report, we evaluate the impact of the supply chain and the company
headauarters in line with the values of respect and responsibility for the
environment, focussing on:

© Renewable energy and reduced consumption.

© Recyclable materials.

© Reduction in the amounts used for containers, packaging and paper
information products.

© Water and waste management.

© Legal compliance.

© Good company practices.

 

Outlined below are the activities and projects undertaken for each topic and
the goals for tangible improvement for the next three year reporting period.

 

MATERIALS

plant extracts in various forms and other organic substances, all ingredients of
exceptional quality and efficacy. We choose packaging that safeguards the

nature of the product in order to guarantee product integrity. We produce Sd
dietary supplements made using substances available in nature, therefore
raw materials cannot come from recycled sources. TARGET 3.8
