> CONTINUOUS COMMITMENT.
We undertake each year to reduce the quantity of unsold or expired
products through:

Planning production through internal strategies and careful sales analysis.

Promotional activity directed at trade to facilitate the output of items nearing
their expiration date and the redistribution of products returned to

headquarters due to problems with delivery, to employees and_ their
families,voluntary and non-profit associations.

 

GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES

> COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

The new means of communication introduced for talks with physicians involves
the use of electronic visuals and an iPad. This has reduced the volume of
physical printed material for this area of trade. Promotional activities at points
of sale require the production of printed materials aimed at consumers. We use
Skype video calls between external collaborators and also between
colleagues at the two sites (Egna and Verona) to keep business running
smoothly and reduce travel tines and costs.

Integration activities between Pegaso and Schwabe colleagues increased
travel between the two premises, with the introduction of car sharing and car
pooling mobility solutions. For Schwabe employees who live in other Italian
regions, the Verona plant allows the partial reduction of car travel time.

PAPER MATERIAL

 

 

n 2019 printed material increased by 55%, because new information
material was printed. We have identified a two-year pattern of increase and
reduction in printed materials, dictated by fluctuations in requirement and in
existing stock.
