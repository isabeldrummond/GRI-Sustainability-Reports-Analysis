Communication with the consumer

We have established a structured quality management system based on
procedures that establish the company’s principle strategic activities, such as
the selection and qualification of suppliers, key stakeholders for
guaranteeing the quality of our products.

The selection parameters for suppliers evaluate production quality and
capability, geographical area, regulatory compliance and the integrity of their
working practices. We are committed to maintaining the highest product quality
standards and to improving them where possible or necessary.

The QP logo that we use in our communications and on packages is
intended to represents what Quality means to us in practical terms.

The administrators together with the technical director are responsible for
managing these topics. In the following pages, we describe the actions,
projects undertaken and goals for improvement over the next three years.
