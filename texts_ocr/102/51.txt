WE GENERATE LOCAL VALUE

lyfe generate value, from the start of the supply chain through to the consumer,
creating wealth which is distributed locally and which expands nationally and,

Ne ; ; .
arnt in part, internationally.

Our policy embraces respect and responsibility towards the surrounding area,
without forgetting national and international collaborations, part of our
commitment to an outward-looking approach.

In 2019 some outreach activities, like sponsorships and participation in local
events and activities, were suspended in order to prioritise internal activities
and the reorganisation of departments in preparation for the merger with
Schwabe Pharma Italia.
