In addition to employees, the organisation also includes Agents and Medical
representatives, who have work contracts with their own VAT code (suppliers)
and who handle the distribution of the products on the ground. They have
ongoing, long-term agreements.

 

In September 2019, the network of representatives began promoting Schwabe
plant-based pharmaceuticals to physicians. This made it necessary to terminate
work contracts with those individuals who were not in possession of the
qualifications required by legislation governing scientific information on drugs.
The network of sales agents in pharmacies and herbalist's was reorganised
nationwide in order to implement national coverage of the existing Schwabe
Pharma Italia network.

SUPPLY CHAIN

he diagram illustrates how the business is developed starting from the
supply of raw materials through to the placing of products on the market.
The Suppliers are generally Stakeholders with whom the company builds human
and commercial relations based on mutual respect and shared objectives.
The upstream suppliers (raw materials, semi-finished goods and third-party
products) are important stakeholders with whom we create partnerships based
on shared mutual values and periodic meetings (audits).

The aim is to maintain a solid and stable relationship over time and to verify
production standards.

This allows us to offer clients products of an outstanding quality standard, with
a known, controlled supply chain, for the most part Italian and regional.
Downstream suppliers - agents, representatives, wholesalers - these are th
intermediary figures who promote and distribute our products on the market
and with whom we maintain a profitable and enduring relationship.
