We attribute paramount importance to optimum storage of products and their
stability and this is reflected in our choice of glass, for example: a material
which impacts the overall weight but which is fully recyclable.

LARGER SIZE PACKAGES: AN ADVANTAGE FOR USERS AND FOR THE
ENVIRONMENT.

The sustainability process brought to the fore the issue of waste generated by
products and highlighted the high percentage of the impact of packs against
their net content. As a result of this, over the years we have responded by

creating larger size packs or using lighter and more eco-friendly materials.

© In 2019 we brought to market larger size packs of AxiMagnesio powder
(180g tub), Enzitime (pack of 48 tablets), PegaStress (pack of 28
sachets).

 

We guarantee product quality and help the consumer dispose of the
containers, using jars and vials in glass, pouches in paper and recycled
plastic accessories.
