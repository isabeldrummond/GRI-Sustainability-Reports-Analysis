The stability of each product is also verified through specific analyses that
verify the technical characteristics over the duration of product life (period of
validity). For this reason, relationships with suppliers, which are formal agreements,
are developed based on specific manufacturing expertise and on
collaboration on new projects.

> RAW MATERIALS.
The choice of raw materials is paramount for obtaining original and
innovative products compared to the existing market offering. Originality
consists in conducting studies on the safety and efficacy of the raw materials.

For our products, we have selected some raw materials that have been patented by the
producers for their originality in terms of production method, bioavailability and proven
efficacy demonstrated by clinical trials.

Vitashine D3°, Meriva™, Brassicare™, Mucosave™, Ultramag™, probiotic strains
(L. helveticus R-52, L. acidophilus LA-14) are used in some formulas.

 

 

> PACKAGING FOR PRODUCT INTEGRITY.
We select product packaging so that it is suitable for.

© Maintaining the characteristics of raw materials.

© Guaranteeing optimum storage for the full period of validity stated on
the package.

© Protecting every single capsule and product efficacy against external
agents (humidity, etc).

© Optimising production costs.

> CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE.
We have established a quality control system (routine and random analyses,
selfinspections) and a system of procedures that establish how to guarantee
and implement quality.
To do this, all internal and external personnel, according to their roles, are
trained and updated on the basic quality principles for systems and products.
The monitoring system for incoming goods, detects any discrepancies and
missing items by cross-referencing contents listed on individual packages,
providing a summary and photographic documentation of any packages,
pallets, damaged items in order to verify the causes and implement suitable
corrective measures.
