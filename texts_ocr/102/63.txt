Ole tasked the in-house technical committee dedicated to sustainability, the
“Supporters Group”, with the reporting process.
The process followed last year, and still valid for 2019, is as follows:

 

© Identification, together with the owners, of the categories of stakeholders
and definition of who should be involved in the report.

© Involvement through on-line questionnaires, of key stakeholders to reveal their
concerns and interest in sustainability topics.

 

© Cross-reference information raised by the questionnaire with an evaluation
of Pegaso's impacts (positive and negative) and the topics brought up by
stakeholders, to define the materiality of topics, associating them where possible
to topics proposed by CRI STANDARDS.

© Definition of material topics for the three-year reporting period 2016-2019;
the Sustainability Technical Committee has chosen or created the indicators for
every material topic.

© Collection and processing of data through special meetings, emails and
phone calls.

© Interim Meetings with administrators and the Supporters Group.

© Drafting of the sustainability report and presentation to the stakeholders,
on-line and paper publication, dissemination through a marketing plan.

ef principles that regard reporting content have been applied during the
entire reporting process, in particular:

 

INVOLVEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS.
This has been practised since the beginning and during the reporting process, especially
through on-line questionnaires.

MATERIALITY.
As explained in the previous points, this has been applied through the combination of

concems and topics raised by on-line questionnaires for every category of stakeholder with
the evaluation of economic, environmental and social impacts, associating definitive topics
with the topics proposed by GRI STANDARDS.

SUSTAINABILITY CONTEXT.
Every topic selected is considered in Pegaso's economic, social and environmental context.
