TARGET 12.4, 12.5

 

 

The packaging used does not come from recycled materials but is, for the most
part, recyclable as long as it guarantees the safety and proper storage of the
product.

We have chosen to use paper from FSC certified forests for all disclosure
and information material supporting our communications.

Suppliers used are therefore certified to guarantee continuity in the FSC chain.
The materials used in our offices are not from recycled sources.

CONTAINERS AND PACKAGING.

We use materials like glass, PE plastic (guaranteed BPA free) and
cardboard, some of which comes from non-recycled renewable sources. Our
packaging is made from recyclable, easily separated materials.

Blister packs are not recyclable, as they are bonded, and are used for
tablets or capsules that are particularly sensitive to external atmospheric
conditions, to ensure optimal product storage. Aluminium blister packs are
currently not economically sustainable.

 

For secondary packaging (shipping of finished product) we optimise
recyclable materials such as cardboard, biodegradable packing peanuts,
Airplus air pillows and polypropylene adhesive tape.

In the last three months the company sold Schwabe products whose packaging
materials are not reported and whose containers will be included in the next

 

56

2020 report.
