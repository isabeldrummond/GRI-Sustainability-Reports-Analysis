SR 2017 #2 ENVIRONMENT 2.5 Emissions
Transport
Transport issue crosses with environmental and safety ones, with 
consequences on organizational and production aspects.
In addition to the norms that regulate the transport sector, the 
Group pays the closest attention to the choice of transport suppli-
ers. Multiple factors influence the selection, such as certification, 
registration in the sector roll, reliability, costs and quality of the of-
fered and performed services.
Last but not least, Neodecortech considers also the carbon foot-
print of products and people transport: when possible, goods and 
products transports occur at full-load and considering the destina-
tions, for increasingly efficiency levels.
For what it concerns workersâ€™ commuting, this is impossible by 
public transports, as Group companies are located in areas not cov-
ered by their services.
