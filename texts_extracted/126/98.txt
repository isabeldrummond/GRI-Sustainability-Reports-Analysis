THE VALUE CHAIN 
Group training figures  
[GRI 404-1] The tables below show Group training hours by professional category and gender. The appendix contains a 
comparative focus for 2018 and 2017 (TIM S.p.A. only), along with a breakdown at TIM Group level of the most important 
training strands (environment, health and safety, human rights, anti-corruption, privacy, sustainability).

[GRI 404-1] The Group invested 10 million euros in training courses in 2019, equal to a cost of 173.43 euros per capita. The 
value shown only takes into account the amount spent on training courses and does not include the personal benefit 
obtained by course participants and the positive impact on TIM’s performance. The training courses are therefore worth 
more than they cost to deliver2.  
 
Remuneration policy  
[GRI 102-37] The Group’s remuneration policy is aimed at ensuring the company remains competitive in the labour 
market, and at achieving the Company’s strategic objectives by pursuing sustainable long-term results in line with TIM’s 
business risk management policy.  
The primary purpose of TIM’s remuneration structure is to balance fixed and variable remuneration and enhance the 
benefit and welfare system, with the aim of increasing recipients’ satisfaction at a sustainable cost. 
The components of individual remuneration are: 
•  fixed remuneration  
•  short-term variable remuneration  
•  long-term variable remuneration  
•  benefit and welfare.  
 
The fixed component takes into account the breadth and strategic nature of the position held and is dictated by 
performance in the reference markets.  
Periodic comparisons of internal remunerations and external market remuneration practices allow the establishment of 
the remuneration strategy to be adopted; TIM’s comparative remuneration market is Italian companies of comparable 
size and/or market capitalization, and international telecoms and media companies.  
Given the need to be selective when making changes to remuneration, especially the fixed component, this will concern 
cases of high quality staff where there is strong misalignment with the reference market average.  
                                                                 
1 Coverage refers to the percentage of participants compared to the total, i.e. the % of human resources of the Group who took part in at least 
one training session compared to the total number of human resources in each individual category. Coverage and per capita are calculated on 
the average number of staff in 2019.

number tables for TIM S.p.A.
