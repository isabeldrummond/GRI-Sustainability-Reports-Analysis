TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE VALUE CHAIN 
•  [GRI 102-8] TIM does not use self-employed workers to carry out its business activities, although it is possible that, on 
an occasional basis, some consultancy type activities may be entrusted to self-employed professionals; 
•  [GRI 102-8] The Group’s activities do not vary seasonally, hence changes in the workforce are correctly shown by the 
annual trends; 
•  [GRI 401-3a] All employees are entitled to parental leave. 
 
 
 
Gender balance  
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 405] There is still a long way to go before true gender balance can be achieved 
in the telecommunications sector which, like all sectors where the main activity is strictly linked to research and 
development of new technologies, still continues to have a mainly male workforce. As women have embraced the world 
of work and, in a parallel fashion, scientific and technological culture and studies, their presence has gradually grown 
within companies, seeing them take on more important roles with higher salaries. The recent Italian Law no. 160 of 
December 27, 2019 (Budget Law 2020, in force since 1 January) modified the provisions of the so-called "pink share" 
(introduced in Law 120/2011) to protect gender equality in relation to representation on the administrative and auditing 
bodies of listed companies, increasing the share for the less represented gender, which has gone from at least a third to 
at least two fifths, and decreeing that it will apply for six consecutive mandates.  
 
This is why at TIM 
•  TIM's Articles of Association will be amended to reflect the new allocation criteria for both the Board of Directors and 
the Board of Statutory Auditors, maintaining their applicability on an ongoing basis (and not only for six consecutive 
terms as provided for by the new regulations); it will not be necessary to change the composition of the corporate 
bodies that already reflect the new shareholding (6/15 on the Board of Directors and 2/5 on the Board of Statutory 
Auditors, respectively); 
•  the current development model pays close attention to ensuring that individual growth paths, starting from the time 
of employment, do not contain any restrictions relating to gender or age differences, and particular attention is paid 
to the female component, where skills and performance are equal; 
•  in 2018, within the skills model, the new “Diversity and inclusion” skill was introduced1; 
•  TIM has been a signatory of the “Manifesto for female employment” since 2017, promoted by “Valore D” and with a 
Company commitment to 9 types of activities related to the gender gap: recruitment policies, women and stem 
disciplines, monitoring female presence in the Company, motherhood support, fatherhood support, agile working for 
goals  and  results,  welfare  policies,  presence  of  women  in  positions  of  strategic  relevance,  updating  of  top 
management bodies on issues of gender. 
•  During 2019, the "Women's Project" was launched, the first phase of which, completed in 2019, was related to an 
important quali-quantitative hearing for all TIM women and also to coordinators of teams with men. 
•  • In Brazil, in July 2019, TIM Participações created a new dedicated organizational units, within the HR Department 
which started dealing with People Caring, Diversity and Inclusion Management activities in a more structured and 
focused way. Gender balance is one of the main focus of the area that has, as its mission, the objective to build and 
manage policies, programs and structured initiatives of diversity and inclusion, aligned with the strategy and 
organization culture and the principles of inclusion and appreciation of the contribution of each employee.
