Electromagnetism and compliance with environmental legislation in force  
The Group has always paid great attention to the issue of electromagnetic emissions. To this end its activities include: 
•  careful management of its equipment during its entire life cycle and in compliance with current regulations and 
internal standards of efficiency and safety; 
•  designing and optimizing the radio access network, ensuring that serious attention is given to the issue of 
electromagnetic emissions at every stage of the equipment life cycle; 
•  use of, and constant research into, the latest technological instruments for checks and controls. 
 
Systematic monitoring of the levels of electromagnetic emissions in installations aims to ensure that legal limits are 
respected and high safety standards are maintained for workers and the general population. Despite Italian regulations 
on electromagnetic emissions being among the strictest in the world, with levels set much lower than the European 
average, checks carried out in Italy have shown that electromagnetic emissions generated are within the legal limits.  
TIM invests in software development to continuously update and refine electromagnetic emission predictions. In 
particular, the GUARDIAN tool calculates the level of exposure of sites that host antennas and ensures that the levels 
established by law are respected. Combined with the TIMplan design platform, its use allows the location of sites and 
orientation of the antennas in relation to a specific context (housing, roads, meeting places) to be optimised. TIM also 
participates actively in the committees and working groups of the CEI (Italian Electrotechnical Committee) for issuing 
guidelines and technical standards on methods used to measure and forecast levels of exposure to electromagnetic fields 
issued by mobile radio systems. Accurate planning and optimization of the mobile radio network (optimum choice of 
sites, optimum use of radio transmission parameters) improves the efficiency of the network for the same amount of 
coverage, maximizing the capacity and quality of the service and minimizing interference, thus contributing to reducing 
the power transmitted by mobile terminals and radio base stations. Again in 2019, the following activities went on 
continuously: 
•  support and training for local organizations in Electromagnetic Impact Analysis (EIA) activities; 
•  evolution of software tools developed internally to predict exposure (GUARDIAN);  
•  development and maintenance of the ARPIE web application for monitoring and assessing the average power 
transmitted by radio base stations of 2G, 3G and 4G systems in accordance with the legal changes introduced by 
Italian  Legislative  Decree  179/2012  “Additional  urgent  measures  for  the  growth  of  the  Country”  and  its 
Implementation Guidelines; 
•  Preparation of guidelines for local 5G access network design, with the implementing the methodologies set out in the 
international and national regulatory framework; 
•  Participation  in  joint  TIM-ARPA  (Regional  Agencies  for  Environmental  Protection)  regional  meetings  for 
implementation of 5G network design methodologies. 
 
In addition, the introduction of Active Antenna Systems for the 5G system, which allow for generating irradiation 
diagrams on a "user basis" and no longer only on a "cell basis", required a review of the regulatory aspects related to the 
topic of electromagnetic field exposure. For this reason TIM has been involved and has contributed to the past and 
ongoing activities of the international (IEC, NGMN, 3GPP) and Italian (CEI, ISPRA-SNIPA) regulatory bodies in this field. The 
APOGEO procedure has been applied to mobile radio systems allowing TIM to ensure that its systems are built in full 
compliance with the design, which in turn is fully compliant with legal requirements for protecting the health of the 
population. APOGEO is an innovative methodology patented by Telecom Italia in 2003 at the European Patent Office, 
which uses for high precision topographic and satellite instruments for 3D surveying of all radiating GSM, UMTS, LTE and 
Radio link systems and their infrastructure. In relation to the development of the 5G system it is important to remember 
that the current limits, provided by law with a wide margin of safety, are not related to specific technologies, but concern 
the total emissions; in addition the network architecture also provides “small cell” solutions which due to their intrinsic 
technological nature use lower radio power. In light of these considerations, the electromagnetic emissions generated by 
5G technology do not represent a business risk. According to current scientific knowledge, emissions associated with base 
stations and wireless networks levels associated with radio base stations and wireless networks are not considered 
responsible for causing negative impacts on health and the population and fall well within the limits set by international
