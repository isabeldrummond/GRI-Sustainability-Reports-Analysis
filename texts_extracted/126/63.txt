Electricity consumption over the last 3 years and share of renewable energy 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
[GRI 302-3] The Group measures its energy efficiency by using an eco-efficiency indicator that establishes a relationship 
between the service offered to the customer (bits transmitted) and the companyâ€™s impact on the environment (joules of 
energy consumed). The factors taken into consideration are the amounts of data and voice traffic of the fixed and mobile 
networks, and energy consumption for industrial purposes (transmission and climate control in exchanges), civil purposes 
(electricity for office use, air conditioning and office heating) and vehicles. The graphs below show the level of the eco-
efficiency indicator over the past three years for the Domestic and Brazil BUs.  
 
 
 
In 2019, the value of the indicator calculated for the Domestic BU was 13.531 bit/joule, up 21.67% compared to 20181 and 
52.43% compared to 2017. This is the result of a substantial increase in data traffic, which, thanks to the efficiency of the 
network, has not led to a corresponding increase in electricity consumption. The commitment continues with the 
establishment for 2020 of a target of 14,200 bit/Joule (see 2019 objectives at the end of this Chapter), equal to an increase 
of 4.94% on the figure for 2019. 
The eco-efficiency index calculated for Brazil shows a continuous improvement too: in 2019 it grew significantly by 58% 
compared to 2018 and by over 438% compared to 2017. The values of the indicators calculated respectively for Italy and 
Brazil are not directly comparable because the two organizations are very different in operational and environmental 
terms: e.g. in Brazil the traffic is primarily mobile and, as previously mentioned, no heating fuels are used in view of the 
particular climate conditions.  
 
 
                                                                 
1  The comparison was made with 2017 data updated from that reported in the last Sustainability Report, following a further revision after its 
publication. The updated 2017 figure for the Domestic BU eco-efficiency indicator is 8,877 bit/joule.
