TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE GROUP 
 
 
TIM’s involvement in these drills is necessary as the company delivers essential services and is part of the National Civil 
Protection System (Law 225/1992), together with other public and private organizations and the Ministry of the Interior’s 
Interministerial Technical Commission for Civil Defence. 
 
In addition, in relation to training, TIM has circulated, inside and outside the Group, the contents of the “Io Non Rischio” 
(“I don’t take risks”) campaign, organized annually by the Civil Protection Department to strengthen the culture of risk 
prevention and raise awareness about safe behavior throughout Italy. This year the campaign came under the banner of 
the “Settimana Nazionale della Protezione Civile” (“National Civil Protection Week”). The TIM Academy has also designed 
and delivered an online course on crisis management, for all heads of the relevant functions, the 20 operational crisis 
teams for defence and civil protection, and all contacts at local institutions. 
 
Finally, TIM has made sure it is represented in national and local institutional crisis units – in times of both crisis and calm 
– and that service requests are satisfied and dealt with within 12 hours and 24 hours as set out in Prime Ministerial 
Directive 3.12.2008 on “operating directions for managing emergencies”.  
 
 
 
Relations with local communities  
In  addition  to  the  usual  relations  with  national  institutions,  as  described  in  the  sustainability  section  of  the 
www.telecomitalia.com website, TIM works every day to ensure that relations with regional and local bodies are lasting 
and satisfactory, in the belief that this is the only way to create the conditions for developing its area of operation and 
improve people’s quality of life, while allowing the institutions and TIM to achieve their respective objectives. 
TIM has a central function entirely dedicated to the management of relations with local authorities, which has also set 
up permanently in the area for ease of communication and to build relationships with government bodies. The function 
also relies on local authority accounts in the region, specialists in managing relations with governmental institutions on 
technical matters concerning the development of fixed and mobile networks.  
 
The Relations with Local Authorities department, as part of its duties: 
•  carries out all possible actions of an institutional nature aimed at facilitating the development of the fixed and mobile 
telecommunications network; 
•  identifies the intervention priorities of the other company departments through the Field Integration Committee1;  
•  establishes the priorities and determines how to interact with public bodies in light of the requirements identified;  
•  constantly monitors existing institutional relations and systematically develops the network of relationships; 
•  contributes to drawing up agreements with regions and municipalities; 
•  listens systematically to all requests and reports from local institutions and directs them correctly to the relevant 
departments within TIM; 
•  supports other departments of TIM in the implementation of territorial projects; 
•  prevents disputes arising, above all in reference to network development issues 
•  actively participates in the intra-operative working tables within the trade associations within Confindustria.
