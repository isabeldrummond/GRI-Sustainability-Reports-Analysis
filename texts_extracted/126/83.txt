TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE VALUE CHAIN 
[GRI 203-1] [GRI 203-2] The following table shows the percentages of coverage as of December for the past three years. 
 
Indicators  2019  2018  2017

(*)  The percentage refers to the residential population. Coverage values are subject to change based on ISTAT and urbanization updates. At the 
end of December 2019, the number of municipalities reached was 7,611. 
(**) FTTX stands for Fibre To The X, where X can be C for cabinet, H for house, B for building or E for exchange. The percentage is determined by 
the ratio between the number of properties connected with “cabinets” reached by access optical fibers (or which can be served directly from 
an exchange if within acceptable distances) and the total number of properties that have or have had active telephone lines in the past 
(includes a small percentage of FTTH related only to the city of Milan). 
 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203] [GRI 203-1] [GRI 203-2] At the end of December 2019, TIM’s FTTX ultra-
broadband network covered:  
•  2,945 municipalities, with FTTC fibre technology service; 
•  124 municipalities, also with FTTH fibre technology service. 
 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203] [GRI 203-1] [GRI 203-2] The principal objectives to increase Italian 
geographical digital inclusion, for 2022, are shown in the following table.

In the closing phase of this report, TIM SpA is defining the coverage objectives of 5G technology in the coming years; 
these objectives will be communicated at a later date. 
 
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 203] A focus on innovation and investments in new infrastructure and 
technologies also characterizes TIM’s action in Brazil. The development of fixed and mobile Ultrabroadband (UBB) 
networks on the one hand and 5G on the other have led to an unprecedented acceleration in the telecommunications 
sector. This is a phenomenon that is opening up new possibilities, and that is profoundly changing people's habits, as they 
become increasingly accustomed to living in a smart and connected world.  
 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 203] TIM has invested nearly 5.4 billion euros in Brazil over the last 5 years, with 
a focus mainly on new generation infrastructure construction and actively contributing to the modernization of the 
country. 
 
[GRI 203-1] In order to improve the reach and accessibility of TIM Participações mobile broadband, and as part of the 
technological evolution outlined in the most recent Industrial Plan presented to the financial community, 4G coverage is 
set to be extended (compared to the LTE1 700 MHz bandwidth), with the expansion of VoLTE2, an increase in the number 
of bio-sites installed, and support for the launch of the fiber-optic network alongside the ultra-broadband plan.  
 
                                                                 
1 Long Term Evolution. 
2 VoLTE (Voice over LTE) is a technology that allows you to make voice calls on the LTE (4G) network.
