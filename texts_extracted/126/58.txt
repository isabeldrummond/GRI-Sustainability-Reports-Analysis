Energy efficiency measures at industrial and/or mixed-use sites  
The initiatives launched in 2018 for industrial sites, offices and data centers have been completed. The details are as 
follows: 
 
Fixed Network area    
•  Exchanges re-engineering project. Phase 2 of the project was completed, with energy efficiency measures introduced 
at 35 sites (baseline consumption: 34 GWh/y) with an expected saving of 10%, which equates to an estimated saving 
of approximately 3.4 GWh when fully operational (2020). There are plans to roll out this project to a further 40 
locations in 2020 (baseline consumption: 40 GWh), with the application of machine learning algorithms; 
•  Introduction of energy efficiency measures in power stations. Work has been completed at 13 sites (baseline 
consumption: 6 GWh/y), with an expected saving of 10%, which equates to 0.6 GWh (2020). There are plans to roll 
out this project at a further 40 locations in 2020 (baseline consumption: 30 GWh), with an expected saving of 10%, 
which equates to 3 GWh (fully operational in 2021).   
 
Offices  
•  The Building Energy Management System project (BEMS). The assessment process has been launched for the 
introduction of energy efficiency measures at 6 office sites (baseline consumption: 20 GWh), with an expected saving 
of 11%, which equates to 2 GWh (2020). There are plans to roll out this project at a further 6 locations in 2020 (baseline 
consumption: 60 GWh), with an expected saving of 12%, which equates to 7.2 GWh/y (2021) when fully operational. 
Machine learning algorithms will also be applied.   
 
IT 
•  Introduction of energy efficiency measures in the Oriolo Romano data center in Rome. The activities designed to 
improve the energy efficiency of the data center are nearing completion, thanks to a plant checking process that 
includes adaptive systems (machine learning); these measures will achieve a saving of 22% of the baseline 
consumption expected for 2020, which equates to around 7 GWh. A similar project will be rolled out at the Cesano 
Maderno data center in 2020 (baseline consumption: 23 GWh), with an expected saving of 12% (2.7 GWh, fully 
operational in 2021)  
•  The Data Center Transformation project - The Data Center Transformation project has been launched, which involves 
a process of compaction across 16 data centers and service centers, with a view to improving energy efficiency across 
this entire area of operation.  
 
Trigeneration 
Distributed  generation  for  self-consumption  was  increased  through  the  optimization  of  existing  plants  and  the 
construction of 6 new trigeneration plants in order to serve the most energy-intensive sites (Rozzano, Bologna, Pomezia, 
Rome Tor Pagnotta, Rome Oriolo Romano). These are expected to be fully operational from February 2021 and will enable 
an increase in self-produced energy estimated at 75 GW of electricity, which equates to 85.5 GWh - a figure which also 
takes into account the lower energy withdrawals from the grid as a result of the energy not consumed by refrigeration 
units. As such, TIM currently operates 30 trigeneration plants. The older plants were subject to a process of optimization 
over the course of 2019. Specifically, this operation saw the replacement of absorbers in 3 large plants (Padua, Rozzano 
and Bologna), with an estimated efficiency recovery of around 10 GWh in 2020 compared to the total for 2019. 
In addition to the internal awareness campaigns regarding energy savings already mentioned at the beginning of this 
section, other Group-wide initiatives include those regarding integrated decommissioning and network simplification ; in 
this area, plans to compact the network (PSTN, ATM DSLAM, IP DSLAM, SuperSGU) and to rationalize and simplify the 
network platforms (Core Voice platforms, transport networks, data networks) are ongoing, with a total saving of more 
than 50 GWh achieved in 2019.
