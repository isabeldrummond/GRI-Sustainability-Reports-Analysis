[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 418] In Brazil, TIM Participações believes that the confidentiality of customer 
information is a primary commitment for telecommunications companies and monitors its systems uninterruptedly in 
order to prevent and detect any unauthorized access attempts.  
 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 418] As pursuant to article 5 of the Federal Constitution, and article 3 of the 
General Law on Telecommunications No. 9,472 of 1997, the right of customers to the confidentiality of their personal data 
is established (with the exception of cases provided for by the law). The Personal Mobile Service regulation, in articles 89, 
90 and 91 of Resolution No. 477 of the national telecommunications agency (ANATEL), requires companies to take 
responsibility in this respect and establishes that any waiver of confidentiality must take place only if requested by the 
relevant authority in the cases provided for by law. The 2014 Federal Law (Marco Civil) No. 12,965 (Brazilian Civil Rights 
Framework for the Internet), under articles 10 and 11, ensures the privacy and protection of personal data for Internet 
users. 
On August 14, 2018 the President of the Republic approved the General Data Protection Act No. 13,709/2018, which will 
come into force in August 2020. This law applies to any data processing by a legal person or entity under the control of 
public or private companies, regardless of the area and country in which the headquarters are located or in which the 
data is located, on condition that:  
•  the processing is carried out in the national territory;  
•  the purpose of data processing is the provision of goods or services or the processing of data of persons located in the 
national territory;  
•  the personal data subject to processing has been collected in the national territory. 
 
To guarantee the confidentiality of the its customers’ information, in accordance with national legislation (including 
Articles 10 and 11 of the “Marco Civil”), TIM Participações has issued relevant internal policies and procedures to ensure 
the confidentiality of information relating to its customers, based on the “need to know” principle (personal data 
processing is restricted to the minimum required to carry out the work) and the separation of duties. These policies and 
procedures set out the methods for the classification and management of information to guarantee suitable protection 
levels.
