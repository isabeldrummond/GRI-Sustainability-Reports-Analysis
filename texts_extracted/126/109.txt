TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE VALUE CHAIN 
Work-life balance 
Work-life balance is the first pillar of TIM’s welfare and is based on the belief that performance and organizational well-
being are connected to each other and to the organisation of family and work life. In 2017, confirmed in 2018 and 2019, 
TIM received the Family Audit certification, a managerial tool that aims to start a cultural shift through innovative life-
work balance initiatives, setting off a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement. 
This is why TIM established a range of services to help its people reduce their care-loads, continuing to adapt all processes 
to the new notion of family, moving from the idea of a nuclear family to the registered family which includes all of the 
employee’s family members, irrespective of blood or legal ties. 
The main services include: 7 company nurseries and 1 company infants’ school; 159 children registered and 355 
reimbursements for partial cover of fees for employees’ children at nurseries or for babysitting services; 41 “TIM Summer” 
campuses/camps/colleges for employees’ children for a total of 6,100 participants; “Mum and Dad” permits for parents 
with children up to age 11, allowing them to use permits for a few hours or entire days to offset their absence within the 
given 3-month period; “Mum and Dad” loans for parents with children aged 0 to 11 who are eligible for loans up to a 
maximum of €2,500 for each child, around 600 reimbursements for university fees for employees’ children, 45 inter-
cultural study grants in India, China and Ireland for children with good school results. Moreover, they can enjoy a wide 
programme of agreements with external organizations (around 200) via two e-commerce portals customized for TIM. 
 
On the occasion of the recent Level II contractual agreement, the transition of flexible work from experimental to 
structural mode of work performance was defined. There are further integrated flexible work initiatives to facilitate the 
work-life balance of certain categories: 
•  pregnant women (1 day more flexible work per week than generally expected); 
•  new mum (1 day more flexible work per week than is generally expected, until the sixth month after returning to work 
from maternity leave); 
•  new dad (1 more day of flexible work per week than is generally expected, until the child is six months old); 
•  return to duty from an illness for more than 30 consecutive days (1 day more flexible work per week than generally 
expected for the month following return from illness) 
Also within the Level II contractual agreement, staff have been given the possibility of clocking in electronically, to have 
up to 24 hours per year of recovery leave in order to facilitate the management of family and non-work commitments in 
general. 
 
The “Special Welfare” programme, as described in the paragraph on remuneration policies in this report, has offered 
management the chance to convert the bonus into services, which can be purchased through a dedicated platform or by 
requesting reimbursement of expenses already incurred, to enjoy the tax advantages offered by law.  
In 2019, a "Well-Being Project" was launched to raise awareness of healthy lifestyles and illness prevention, through four 
themes: 
•  prevention 
•  nutrition education 
•  movement and physical activity 
•  stress reduction 
  
In the field of prevention, the first e-learning training module, available for all on the TIM Academy platform, dealt with 
sexually transmitted illnesses. 
Finally, within the "Movement and Physical Activity" strand, a partnership with Gympass was launched, which allows 
employees with a single monthly subscription to access over 2,200 sports centers at affordable prices.
