in the Performance Review 
 
 
Below are the main development activities that defined 2019: 
•  Onboarding: for welcoming new recruits to the Company (junior staff, professionals and managers), to speed up their 
“time to perform” and encourage engagement and “intent to stay”. In 2019 a further refinement based on feedback 
collected  through  monitoring  tools  (individual  interviews,  surveys)  was  carried  out  in  order  to  increase  the 
engagement of all involved. 
•  Performance Management: the process involves the evaluation of the goals and responsibilities of the entire 
workforce (managers, professionals and office workers) and is divided into five phases (assignment of objectives, 
evaluation, mid-year review, evaluator’s selection, feedback). In the first four months of this year the entire 2018 
Performance Management process was concluded which involved the entire Domestic Business Unit (around 47,000 
people): [GRI 404-3] 99.3% of people were evaluated by their direct superior and 82% stated that they received 
feedback from their superior. Performance Management 2019 was launched in May of that year with a phase of goal 
assignment, and was completed in June. At the beginning of September, the mid-year review phase started with the 
aim of giving people the opportunity to integrate the assigned objectives panel with new activities that emerged 
during the year. The phase ended at the end of October and involved 27% of people.
