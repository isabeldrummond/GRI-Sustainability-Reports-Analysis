TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
ENVIRONMENT 
 
rules that reduce their environmental impact, particularly during the production phase and the end-of-life management 
of equipment. It is the responsibility of the ICT sector, and therefore also of TIM, to consider these aspects, focusing on 
research and development to create products with a low environmental impact throughout the entire life cycle. 
At the end of the 1990s, TIM launched a series of internal research and development activities to finalist the building of 
terminals with a reduced environmental impact. The Telecom Italia Green logo, renamed TIM eco-friendly in 2015, was 
created  to  identify  both  TIM’s  environmental  protection  initiatives  and  projects  and  eco-friendly  products. 
For each product and initiative with this logo, information is provided about the features and specific solutions adopted 
to demonstrate their eco-friendliness and/or environmental benefit. In the case of products, this information appears in 
the environmental statement, drawn up in accordance with the UNI EN ISO 14021 standard, as well as in the sustainability 
section of the telecomitalia.com website, where information can also be found about the “eco-friendly” features of 
initiatives and projects. 
The TIM eco-friendly range includes dedicated products for businesses and consumers developed in cooperation with 
suppliers. The electricity savings also translate into an equivalent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The entire TIM 
eco-friendly range of products are designed using eco-design criteria. The casing and packaging are made using uniform, 
recycled and/or recyclable materials. In 2019 TIM Gamepad Bluetooth was launched, part of the eco-friendly line with 
excellent results in environmental tests and an appropriate environmental declaration1.  
 
 
TIM’s environmental performance 
Energy and natural resources consumption 
[GRI 302-1], [GRI 302-2], [GRI 302-4] The Group’s energy consumption is presented broken-down into consumption for 
heating, transport and purchased and produced electricity. 
 
Heating 
The data in the table shows a significant reduction in 2019 compared to 2018 and 2017 mainly attributable to real estate 
rationalization and energy efficiency. In Brazil, given the particular climate conditions throughout the year, indoor heating 
is not used. Compared to 2018, consumption of energy for heating decreased in 2019 by 34,647,936 MJ.
