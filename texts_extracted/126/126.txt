TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE VALUE CHAIN 
system "ConciliaWeb", developed by the Authority which had also established procedures for the on-line presentation 
and management of the conciliation event for customers. 
Beyond the choice of procedure by the customer, the underlying aspect of the conciliation is always the customer’s needs, 
making it possible to build up a good relationship between the customer and the Company. 
 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] To date, the conciliation model has achieved high 
qualitative and quantitative results; specifically, in 2019 the use of the Co.Re.Com channel continued to see significant 
figures, accounting for 72.5% of the conciliations discussed, while the Joint channel accounted for 27.5% of the requests 
discussed (the Chamber of Commerce channel was closed in July 2018). 
The positive trend seen in the conciliation system in previous years continued in 2019 (albeit with a significant increase in 
the number of cases discussed, equal to 68,465, an increase of 16.4% compared to 2018); in fact:  
•  97% of the applications for joint conciliation (18,249 conciliated out of 18,820 discussed), a stable percentage year on 
year despite an increase in the applications discussed again this year (+11.6% compared to 2018); 
•  83.3% of the requests discussed at the Co.Re.Com (41,372 reconciled out of 49,645 discussed). This percentage 
remained high in 2019, also considering the 19.5% increase in the cases discussed compared to the previous year 
(41,554 in 2018). 
 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] TIM supported the conciliation activity through: 
•  the seminars and joint training initiatives involving dedicated personnel from TIM, AGCom, Co.Re.Com. and Consumer 
Associations;  
•  the debates, conferences, interviews and the other promotional activities involving senior management in order to 
disseminate the correct cultural approach to the subject.   
 
Conciliation is becoming increasingly widespread among customers, particularly in view of the: 
•  better knowledge of the procedure (both joint and conciliaweb) which is considered to be a quick and economical way 
of resolving disputes; 
•  economic crisis that leads to conciliation even for marginal amounts; 
•  the widespread territorial presence of Co.Re.Com and the various Consumer Associations, able to bring the conciliation 
tool increasingly closer to the local needs of consumers. 
  
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] In Brazil TIM Participações has close relations with the 
Agencies that are part of the consumer protection system, such as ministries, public defenders and legitimate civil 
protection entities, which promote the culture of good relationships between companies and their customers, including 
SENACON1 and PROCONS2; TIM Participações also participates in the Conciliation Forum, which promotes dialog between 
companies and consumer protection agencies, with the aim of resolving disputes, managing workshops with consumer 
protection authorities for company employees and taking part in external events to improve the quality of service offered 
to its customers. 
TIM Participações is the Brasilian operator with the penultimate number of complaints in PROCONS, part of the SINDEC, 
the national consumer protection Information System (source: SINDEC of SENACON official report). 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] In 2014 SENACON launched the Consumidor.Gov.br 
platform service for the mediation of conflicts, which facilitates the resolution of customer complaints and makes 
PROCONS' work easier. TIM Participações was one of the first companies to join the aforementioned platform, through 
which customers can also report whether the complaint has been resolved or not and the quality of the response provided 
by the company. In 2019, the average customer satisfaction score of TIM Participações, who used the aforementioned 
platform service, was 4 on a scale of 1 to 5. 
 [GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 102-43] [GRI 102-44] Also in 2014, following an ANATEL resolution, TIM 
Participações has established its own Users’ Council, which aims to offer solutions to improve the quality of the services 
provided. In 2017, the Users’ Council, together with the Public Defence Department, created a new conciliation channel - 
Canal 0800 Defensoria Pública - which aims to reduce complaints in court, through a direct channel of communication 
between the Public Defenders and TIM Participações. In 2018, this channel was made available to Public Defense
