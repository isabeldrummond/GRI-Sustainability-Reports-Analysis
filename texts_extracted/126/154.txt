TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
•  the definition of a gradual improvement path which, starting with simple respect for the local laws, guides the policies 
and processes of Human Rights towards sharing with the appropriate stakeholders through appropriate involvement 
initiatives; 
•  the highlighting of any gaps or inconsistencies between the company’s various departments and/or between the 
different companies of the Group; 
•  the possibility to discuss Human Rights with the other companies. 
 
[GRI 412-1] TIM carried out the first due diligence on Human Rights (concluded in 2014) using the tool OCAI1, and the 
involvement of the Group’s two biggest entities in terms of workforce and investments, in other words the Domestic BU2 
(the percentage covered was 98% as it excluded Olivetti and TIM Sparkle) and the Brazil BU. The Sustainability Reporting, 
Monitoring and Relationship Department examined the questionnaires that had been filled in and conducted the related 
feedback with the Italian departments in order to further examine the contributions provided and define the action plans 
for the level two and three self-assessments (respectively 3.1% and 8.6% of all the responses)3.  
In Italy, at the end of the feedback, the following emerged: 
•  on a scale of one to six, the average score of all the answers was 4.4; 
•  the need to prepare the TIM Group’s Human Rights policy (around 2/3 of the insufficient self-assessments regarded 
this aspect); 
•  the usefulness of organising internal Human Rights training courses. 
 
 [GRI 414-1] [GRI 414-2] The results of the audit on Human Rights carried out on the suppliers of the Group are set out in 
this document and in the Sustainability section of the Group’s website. 
 
Human Rights Policy 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] The Policy applies to every 
individual within the Group and also concerns Third Parties who have business dealings with TIM. 
The Policy, issued in 20154, aims to make respect for Human Rights an essential requirement in the performance of TIM’s 
operational activities. Both in Italy and in foreign companies, the Group has set up processes through which it undertakes 
to respect Human Rights and has identified those that may be negatively influenced by the Company’s activities, such 
as: 
•  [GRI 403-3] [GRI 406-1] [GRI 408-1] [GRI 409-1] Human rights common to all industry sectors (e.g. rights concerning 
health and safety at work, diversity, equality and non-discrimination, working hours, fair pay, minimum age for 
starting work, accessibility for disabled people, maternity protection, forced/compulsory/restricted labor, the zero 
tolerance approach to any form of corruption, the rights of our customers to responsible advertising, rights related to 
the use of armed security, according to the highest international standards and practices); 
•  [GRI 407-1] rights agreed with the unions and included in National Labour Agreements (in line with the principles of 
the International Labour Organization). 
 
The Group’s internal processes also focus on a series of individual rights affected by the core business, including the rights: 
•  associated with access to telecommunications services and innovation;
