TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE VALUE CHAIN 
Benefits and welfare constitute non-monetary elements of remuneration.  
In particular: 
•  benefits are assets made available to beneficiaries, depending on their role and are aimed at improving their well-
being; these services generate an economic value separate from both fixed salary and other forms of variable 
remuneration;  
•  welfare is the package of non-monetary services available to the entire corporate population regardless of role, aimed 
at increasing individual and family well-being of all employees.
