TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE GROUP 
The more a theme, a concept, reoccurs in the analyses documents (and therefore the more it occurs), the more it can be 
considered “relevant” for the sector. 
 
 
Identification of relevant themes 
At the end of the analysis, TIM was able to draw up a list of themes to be assessed to identify the priorities of the Company 
and those of external stakeholders: In particular, the activities carried out made it possible to name and describe in detail 
the issues identified in 2018, narrowing the list to those more specific to TIM and its stakeholders:  
▪  correctness of corporate conduct; 
▪  stakeholder engagement; 
▪  integration of social, environmental and governance aspects into corporate strategies; 
▪  managing the workforce; 
▪  development of the company's human capital; 
▪  managing the health and safety of workers 
▪  fair management of customer relationship; 
▪  safeguarding privacy and personal data protection and security; 
▪  Investments in 5G and UBB infrastructure development, and in R&D; 
▪  protect diversity and promote equal opportunities in the Company; 
▪  stimulate the spread of e-technologies and e-skills; 
▪  integration of social and environmental aspects within the supply chain; 
▪  protection of vulnerable groups (cyberbullying, child pornography, gambling); 
▪  promoting and safeguarding human rights; 
▪  reducing energy consumption and fighting climate change; 
▪  impacts of electromagnetic emissions 
▪  fostering the development of an inclusive digital society. 
 
 
Attribution of relevance scores to the topics 
The 17 issues that emerged from the analysis described above have been submitted for stakeholders' evaluation and to 
TIM's management, in order to define the degree of priority in the 2019 matrix.  
The internal viewpoint was provided by Top Management which, thanks to the involvement of a significant sample of 
representative contact people from the company’s main departments, expressed its opinion on the importance of each 
theme for TIM’s strategy1.  
 
Collecting external points of view was done with innovative tools such as semantic and big data analysis2, and on the 
collaborative platform on which RE2N set up an area for TIM to consult and involve its stakeholders3.  
This approach has enabled TIM to: 
•  further extend listening to more stakeholders; 
•  make dynamic the observation of the themes in order to measure their evolution over time.  
 
About 490 TIM stakeholders have been invited to the consultation and 98 have participated, representing institutions, 
suppliers, customers, the business community of the sector, civil society and the financial community. With regard to 
People, findings from the "Engagement 2019" survey, completed by over 30,000 employees, have been taken into 
                                                                 
1 Based on the following scale: 1=barely influential; 2=limited impact; 3=direct influence; 4=significant influence; 5=decisive. 
2 In keeping with activities of the previous years, stakeholders involved in engagement activities were surveyed, in addition to many other entities, 
for a total of approximately 500, concerning 8 categories of TIM stakeholders. Three types of sources were identified for the analysis:  
• documents issued by stakeholders (in particular sustainability reports); 
• statements issued on company websites; 
• discussions on social networks concerning the themes identified thanks to TIM Data Room activities.   
3Ninety-seven people replied to the questionnaire, representing institutions, suppliers, customers, industry business community, civil society, 
financial community and people, providing their own assessment of the issues – using the same scale used by management for the internal one 
– as well as suggestions and feedback;
