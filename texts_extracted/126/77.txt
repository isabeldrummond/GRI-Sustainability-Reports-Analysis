TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE VALUE CHAIN 
expertise that cover all network knowledge areas, meeting innovative requirements and supporting research and 
development activities. 
An important result was the creation of TIM Lab a multifunction environment focused on innovation, able to assess 
technologies, products and innovative services, certify their functional efficiency and performance, and develop new 
models and configurations, consolidating the innovation flow. TIM Lab has a strategic role in supporting credibility testing 
(service validation tests), inspections and proof of concepts, working with leading suppliers and technology partners, 
sharing knowledge, technological infrastructure for interoperability tests, evaluating resources and defining technical 
requirements; in synergy with the R&D department, it facilitates innovation and promotes collaborations with universities 
and research institutes. 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203] In January 2017, a new office was opened for the TIM Lab Innovation Center 
at the CEO's head office in Barra da Tijuca, in the State of Rio de Janeiro: boasting a surface area of 650 m2 that can 
accommodate over 60 people. This new site can be used by engineers and researchers, and as an innovation space open 
to new opportunities, steering innovation on the Brazilian telecommunications market and featuring as a national leader 
for R&D activities1. 
In 2019, over 140 validation processes were carried out on new software, functionalities, solutions, technologies, services 
and devices. TIM Participações invested more than 2.7 million reais in instruments, infrastructure and services, and 
additional investments for over 10 million reais have been planned for the 2020-2022 period. 
The "Architecture & Innovation" department continues to work on projects and initiatives aiming to ensure the evolution 
of the business of TIM Participações through the recommendation of sustainable, efficient network platforms and 
disruptive models, including anticipating the availability of new services. These projects can be divided into the following 
macro groups: 
•  new generation networks; 
•  with positive impacts on the environment and company; 
•  future Internet applications; 
•  Open Lab Initiatives. 
 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach] [GRI 203] New generation networks projects 
The reassignment of the 1,800 MHz, 850 MHz and 2,100 MHz bands from 2G/3G to 4G, with a multilayer distribution 
configuration, gives TIM Participações three important competitive advantages: 
•  a reduction in LTE2 implementation costs; 
•  an increase in LTE coverage and enabling of the Carrier Aggregation strategy, improving customer experience by 
means of a higher “throughput”; 
•  the best indoor coverage. In addition to increased coverage, use of the 850/1,800/2,100 MHz bands could increase 
capacity in cities already covered by the LTE 2.6 GHz band, at limited additional cost. 
 
In this scenario, over 96% of current LTE terminals are compatible with 1,800 MHz, 2,600 MHz bands and other available 
bands. Therefore, the implementation of the multilayer LTE is still an excellent strategy benefiting from the dissemination 
of devices. 
 
The implementation of the LTE layer at 700 MHz has continued to improve the increase in coverage and penetration in 
closed environments significantly, promoting LTE at a national level and consolidating the leadership of TIM Participações 
in LTE. The actual roll-out will observe the rules of the EAD3, in order to manage spectrum cleaning and avoid interference 
with TV broadcasting services. 86% of the current user base of LTE devices of TIM Participações is enabled for the 700 
MHz band (December 2019).  
At the end of December 2019, 2,313 cities had LTE coverage at 700 MHz, i.e over 93% of the urban population; spectrum 
cleaning was completed in June 2019 in all Brazilian cities, in order to have a 700 MHz band Over 3,300 cities covered by 
TIM Participações in the 700 MHz band are expected by the end of 2022, according to the 2020-2022 business plan. 
 
                                                                 
1 TIM Lab of TIM Participações also works with TIMLab Italy, that has over 50 years of experience and some 1,000 employees, including 
engineers and researchers, over 3,000 patents registered and more than 12,000 m2 of floor space
