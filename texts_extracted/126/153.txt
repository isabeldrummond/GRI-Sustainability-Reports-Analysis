TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
[GRI 103-1: Management Approach] [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] The materiality analysis, 
conducted by TIM in 2019, confirmed the promotion and protection of Human Rights as a material topic for stakeholders 
and for the Group, along the entire “value chain”. This result, which may seem surprising for a telecommunications 
operator that works in countries considered to be at low/medium risk of Human Rights violations, is based on two sets of 
reasons: 
•  the broad meaning TIM assigns to the concept of “Human Right”. This sphere includes not only basic Human Rights 
common to all economic sectors, such as the right to fair remuneration, non-discrimination, the right to not resort to 
forced/compulsory/bonded work, etc., but also Human Rights specific to a telecommunications company, such as the 
right to access information, freedom of expression (in particular online), protection of privacy and safety online, and 
protection of children (from cyberbullying, for example); 
•  the public outcry caused by Human Rights violation incidents, which can seriously affect business reputation. 
 
TIM’s Commitments 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] TIM signed up to the Global 
Compact in 2002; between 2008 and 2011, TIM was a member of the UN Global Compact Human Rights Working Group 
set up by the Global Compact Board in 2006 with the aim of providing Global Compact with a strategic Human Rights 
input. 
 
From 2012 to 2019, TIM has been one of the members of “The Human Rights Peer Learning Group” (PLG), established in 
the context of the Global Compact Network Germany with the “technical” support of Twentyfifty Ltd. 1 
In recent years, in order to strengthen its commitment to the protection of Human Rights, TIM has implemented, inter 
alia: 
•  Human Rights due diligence; 
•  the “Respecting Human Rights in the TIM Group” policy; 
•  information and training on Human Rights. 
 
[GRI 103-3: Management Approach [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] TIM monitors and analyses

Due Diligence  
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 406] [GRI 407] [GRI 408] [GRI 409] [GRI 410] [GRI 412] Among the objectives of 
due diligence are: 
•  the identification and mapping of Human Rights risks resulting from the company’s operations;  
•  confirmation that each topic is assigned to a responsible body (governance), is governed by a specific internal 
regulatory framework (e.g. policy, procedure), has a management system that regularly monitors and traces the 
performances (if possible through appropriate indicators, such as those concerning health and safety);
