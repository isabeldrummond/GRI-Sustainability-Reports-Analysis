1  The number of high risk suppliers varies year on year, as it depends on the orders made every year and the procurement market in which the 
suppliers operate. The same applies in general to the total number of suppliers belonging to the various procurement markets. 
2 The KPI refers to new suppliers and existing suppliers in case of renewal or extension of their qualification. 
3Since the beginning of 2019, supplier assessments based on a questionnaire with social and environmental principles have been replaced by a 
due diligence questionnaire that includes elements of ethics and conflict of interest. The previous socio-environmental survey was nonetheless 
applied to all suppliers of goods and services (not just to those of an amount higher than a million reais). In 2019 87% of suppliers completed 
the socio-environmental survey.
