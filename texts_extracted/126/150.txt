TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE VALUE CHAIN 
The first three areas affected by these actions were health and safety, environment and working hours.  
On 16 and January 17, 2019, the eighth annual suppliers Forum in the JAC programme was held in Shenzhen (China) on 
the theme of: "Circular economy and responsible use of resources." The event was attended by more than 260 
sustainability  and  procurement  professionals  from  leading  telecommunications  operators,  Information  and 
Communication Technology (ICT) providers, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Non Governmental Organizations 
(NGOs) and researchers. 
During the forum, awards were given to suppliers who have adopted best practices in health and safety and who have 
distinguished themselves for the spirit of collaboration shown during the CSR audit campaign.  
Supplier involvement initiatives 
[GRI 103-2: Management Approach] [GRI 308] [GRI 414] Use of the suppliersâ€™ portal (vendors hub), launched at the end of 
2011 to improve communication and optimize operational processes by applying social networking systems to the 
business context, is now well established; the Portal has around 4,149 vendors enabled to use the application platform. 
The portal allows suppliers to access a private area to view important data and events connected to their relationship 
with TIM and manage all their own details, thus acquiring significant advantages in smooth operation and transparency. 
The vendors hub also includes a public area containing information for potential suppliers. 
Documentation is exchanged electronically (e.g. offers, purchase orders, contracts, qualification documentation, surveys), 
therefore reducing the environmental impact resulting from the use of paper, transporting and storing documents.
