TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE VALUE CHAIN 
•  Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), typical of many industry needs and the most demanding vertical 
markets - self-driving cars energy management, robotics - and mission critical public safety applications;1 
•  Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), which enables object connectivity, IoT (Internet of Things) and Smart 
Cities. 
 
Over the next few years, 5G will be the revolution that everyone can experience in their daily lives. Its field of application 
is much wider than the technology that came before, thanks to the current scenarios in which it will be used, which are 
characterized by:  
•  sensors available, at competitive costs, able to decipher physical information into digital, transforming the objects 
around us into digital data;  
•  the most widespread connectivity allowing any object to transfer and receive data at any time; 
•  artificial intelligence technology allowing sophisticated processing of large amounts of information. 
 
Main applications will target: 
•  the automotive and transport sector:  
•  the area of connectivity between vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructures, aimed at increasing safety, 
saving energy and reducing traffic;  
•  infotainment2 connectivity, where large volumes of data can be transmitted on the move (e.g. GPS3, parking 
sensors, voice commands, guidance systems and assisted braking);  
•  self driving and connected cars which - thanks to a system able to receive all the information about the 
surrounding environment - can be remotely controlled and driven; 
•  industry 4.0, namely: 
•  digital transformation of the industrial world with the adoption of robots, three-dimensional printers (3D printing) 
and other complex tools;  
•  the systematic addition of sensors to products, to produce data to improve production and processes;  
•  the evolution of the supply chain to enable real-time management of relations with suppliers and end customers; 
•  the new media world, with changing use habits and new formats, including virtual and augmented reality solutions, 
which require new transmission capabilities;  
•  healthcare, with remote assistance, to enable specialists to assist patients with chronic diseases from afar;  
•  public safety, with mobile video surveillance solutions that can integrate data and images for a far broader vision, 
guaranteeing greater public security levels than the past; 
•  assistance for tourists who can have information and multimedia content on their visits at their fingertips, thanks to 
sensors on their smartphones; 
•  the information sector which can ensure “live” connections with a better video quality without complex instruments, 
thanks to a greater bandwidth availability, combined with a reduced latency. 
 
TIM's 5G is already available with services for citizens and businesses in Rome, Turin, Florence and Naples with speeds of 
up to 2 Gigabits per second. Recently the cities of Genoa, Brescia and Monza have been added; Milan is a "5G ready city".  
The next cities to be covered by the 5G service will be Bologna, Verona, Ferrara, Matera and Bari. 
By 2021 coverage will comprise 120 cities, 200 tourist destinations, 245 industrial districts and 200 specific projects for 
large enterprises. 
 
5G system implementation must be done in compliance with energy efficiency constraints (measured in bit/Joule) since, 
according  to  the  ITU  IMT-Vision  recommendation  (M.2083),  energy  consumption  of  the  new  system  must  be 
appropriately monitored and “not greater” than that of existing networks. With a view to this, TIM is already assessing 
the energy consumption of new radio base stations in light of eMBB, to ensure the increase in occupied bandwidth (up to 
100 MHz) is not accompanied by a proportional increase in consumption. 
                                                                 
1 Vertical markets are linked to a specific industrial sector and defined by end customer type (not product type). Meeting the needs of vertical 
market customers means providing them with added value in terms of expertise and market-specific best practice, as well as having a detailed 
understanding of customer needs and related market development factors. 
2 A word of Anglo-Saxon derivation that merges the words information (information) and entertainment (entertainment). Car infotainment is the 
set of multimedia functions at the service of a car. 
3 Global Positioning System.
