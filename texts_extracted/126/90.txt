The high turnover recorded in Brazil is mainly linked to TIM store employees, who have, as for the Brazilian market in 
general, a high turnover. The company is working to improve this data by improvements to both the recruitment process 
and total compensation to increase staff retention.  
The Group composition can be analyses according to various types of segmentation, as shown elsewhere.
