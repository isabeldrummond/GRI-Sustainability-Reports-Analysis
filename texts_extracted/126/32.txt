TIM Sustainability Report 2019 
THE GROUP 
TIM regularly provides suitable, appropriate training to corporate bodies and employees on anti-corruption subjects as 
well as on application of the 231 Organizational Model. As part of the on-boarding training for new recruits to TIM S.p.A., 
specific anti-corruption is also provided.  
Every two or three months, the Compliance Department sends all first and second reporting levels in the organization a 
report containing the main regulatory and legal novelties also on anti-corruption and the responsibilities of bodies. 
The targeted training campaigns are periodic and, in any case, are held when internal regulations, such as the 231 
Organizational Model, are updated.

[GRI 206-1] The TIM Group was identified as a participant in the following major litigations related to anti-competitive 
behavior, violations of anti-trust regulations and monopoly practices. 
Anti-trust case A428 Year 2013 for abuse of a dominant position. In 2017 TIM was notified of the final outcome by the 
AGCM, which recognized TIM as fully compliant with the A428 provision and as such not punishable by non-compliance 
sanctions. Vodafone disputed the final decision adopted by the AGCM on the non-compliance investigation with the Lazio 
Regional Administrative Court (TAR). TIM filed an appearance, as in the other lawsuits filed in March 2017 by the operators 
CloudItalia, KPNQWest Italia and Digitel. 
Anti-trust proceedings I761 Year 2013 The AGCM has granted TIM an extension to the preliminary investigation started in 
March of the same year regarding some companies active in the sector of fixed network maintenance services and aimed 
at verifying the existence of a prohibited agreement in accordance with Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of 
the European Union (TFUE). In December 2019, the Council of State ruled in favor of TIM and canceled the AGCM I761 
provision, remanding the task of implementing ex novo the preliminary investigation to the AGCM, within the limits 
decided by the Council of State itself. 
Anti-trust case A514 Year 2017 regarding the possible abuse of dominant position in the markets of wholesale access and 
retail services using the broadband and ultra-broadband fixed network. In July, 2018 TIM filed proposed commitments 
which, if accepted by the Authority, would close the investigation without any offense being established or sanction being 
administered. In September 2019 the AGCM resolved on a new extension of the procedure's deadline, setting it in February 
2020.
