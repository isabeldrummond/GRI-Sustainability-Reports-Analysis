TIM Participações offers its own Whistleblowing channel for clarification requests or forwarding complaints of alleged 
Human Rights violations by internal and external stakeholders, ensuring maximum confidentiality. A unique identification 
code, associated with each reported complaint, allows the complainant to check the status of the work in complete 
anonymity. Full information about this is available by clicking on this link: tim.com.br/sp/canal-de-denuncias.
