Atmospheric emissions 
[GRI 305-1] [GRI 305-2] [GRI 305-3] [GRI 305-5] [GRI 305-6] The Group’s greenhouse gas emissions consist almost 
exclusively of carbon dioxide generated by fossil fuels for heating, transport, power generation and the purchase of 
electricity from third parties. In addition to these, fugitive emissions of hydro chlorofluorocarbons, hydro fluorocarbons 
(HCFCs and HFCs) and other gases from air conditioning and fire prevention systems are also considered and converted 
into kg of CO equivalent (see table Emissions of ozone depleting gases in this section).

For atmospheric emissions as well, use is made of the GHG Protocol approach, distinguishing between direct or Scope 1 
emissions (use of fossil fuels for transport, heating, power generation and fugitive ozone depleting emissions), indirect or 
Scope 2 emissions (purchase of electricity for industrial and civil use) and other indirect or Scope 3 emissions. Nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions [GRI 305-7] are negligible in Group emissions. 
The following table shows market based Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

* The emission factors used in 2019 are the ones published by ISPRA (Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale) in 2019, possibly 
supplemented with DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) data. The WRI/GHG Protrocol proposed the factors used in 
previous years. 
** The value of CO2 equivalent emissions of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) and other refrigerant gases is calculated 
with reference to the respective global warming potentials (GWP - Global Warming Potential) shown in the specific table. the index is based on 
a relative scale that compares the gas considered with an equal mass of carbon dioxide with a GWP of 1.  
***A residual mix value of 483 grams of CO2 per kWh (AIB, 2018) was used to calculate emissions linked to the consumption of electricity from 
mixed sources purchased on the Italian market (Scope 2 market based). For previous years, the coefficient published by WRI/GHG Protocol (2009) 
calculated based on the national mix was used. For Brazil, the average grid factors for 2017, 2018 and 2019 calculated and published by the local 
Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication were used. They amounted to approximately 92.7, 74 and 75 grams of CO2/kWh 
respectively. 
^ The comparison was made with methane consumption data from 2017, which was updated from that reported in the 2017 Sustainability Report 
as it was received after its publication. The updated 2017 figure is equal to 27,860,685 m3 of methane for cogeneration, whose related 2017 
emissions amount to 54,693,813 kg of CO2. 
^^ The comparison was made with updated 2017 data following a review. The updated 2017 figure is equal to 729,941,521 kg of CO2
