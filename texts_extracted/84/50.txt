“Kids in the Office (Bimbi in ufficio)”: 
is an opportunity for all  employees’ 
children to discover what mom and 
dad do at work. With this initiative, we 
endeavour to break down the barriers 
between working life and private life. 
For children, it is a learning experience 
and a step towards acceptance of 
detachment from parents; for parents, 
it is an opportunity to share a part of 
their personal life with colleagues.  
Bimbi in Ufficio includes workshops, 
age-appropriate games and fun, 
all designed to make the parents 
workplace known to children.
