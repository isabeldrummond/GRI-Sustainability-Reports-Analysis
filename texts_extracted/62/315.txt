With respect to the issues in the 2017 sustainability report, there were no significant changes, but some 
integrations and combinations were made. Specifically, the following issues were added: Digitalisation 
innovation, data analytics, artificial intelligence; Quality and consumption of the mains water; Air and soil 
protection; Integration of sustainability in the risk analysis. 
It is hereby disclosed that the issue of the respect for human rights is not regarded as material because the 
Group(cid:859)s operational offices are located mainly in Italy or in countries in which a significant risk from this 
point of view has not been noted. This evaluation also takes into account the information reported in the 
Suppliers chapter where the provenance of foreign supplies is detailed. It should be pointed out that in 
2018 four Group companies (Hera SpA, Hera Luce S.r.l., AcegasApsAmga Servizi Energetici S.p.A. and 
AcegasAspAmga S.p.A.) were SA8000 certified, a voluntary standard that lists the requirements for ethically 
correct conduct towards workers and that focuses on the respect for human rights, especially the principles 
of dignified work on the basis of ILO conventions.
