and the clause that prohibits using accessory work services (so-called vouchers) under contracts for works 
or services.  
Lastly, it should be noted that in 2018 a new Operating Instruction was issued regarding the verification of 
tax payment regularity. As part of its corporate social responsibility, the Hera Group attributes a value to 
the automated and centralised method used for verification of tax payment regularity that, in addition to 
ensuring the application of the regulations, identifies and implements a checking and auditing process that 
responsibly involves the company(cid:859)s entire supply chain involved in the management of supplies, so as to 
make this control even more systematic and widespread.

digital-friendly culture and widespread know-how on these issues, while strengthening the vertical and 
cross-functional skills of Group employees. The first phase involved creating a survey, based on an online 
gaming path and aimed at exploring the Group(cid:859)s propensity for Digital, Data Analytics, Smart Working and
