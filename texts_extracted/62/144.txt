This paragraph also contains data on the Faenza biomass plant (operated by Enomondo, 50% owned by 
Herambiente and not consolidated using the line-by-line method), equipped with a double reaction system 
(catalytic and non-catalytic) to reduce concentrations of nitrogen oxides. 
The  Padua,  Pozzilli  and  Trieste  plants  have  a  single  reaction  and  filtration  system  to  lower  the 
concentrations of particulate, hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, sulphur dioxide, heavy metals, dioxins 
and  furans  and  aromatic  polycyclic  hydrocarbons,  a  single  reaction  system  for  reducing  nitric  oxide 
concentrations (double for Padua) and a single fume monitoring system. 
In addition to the aforementioned activities, the following operations are carried out on an annual basis to 
monitor emissions and environmental impact: 
•  timely controls of the chimneys, at a frequency set by the Integrated Environmental Authorization, 
for the parameters which cannot be continuously monitored, using certified inspectors; 
•  checks on soil fallout of pollutants: through external monitoring programmes in collaboration with 
University  and  research  agencies,  deposition  analyses  are  performed  on  soil,  ground  and 
vegetation, etc., in order to ascertain that the emissions, in addition to being within the regulatory 
limits, do not have any significant impact on the surrounding environment.

The data are calculated using continuous measurement systems which are subject to the approval of the supervisory bodies at the 
time of authorization for operation of the plant. The procedures used by individual plant systems to collect and calculate the 
volume of substances released are not completely standardized. Including the Enomondo waste-to-energy plant. 
The mass flow analysis shows an improvement in terms of emissions of hydrochloric acid (-4% compared to 
2017), nitrogen oxides (-2% compared to 2017), sulphur oxides (-12% compared to 2017), carbon monoxide 
(-1% compared to 2017) and total organic carbon (-7% compared to 2017). The values for particulate and 
fluoridic  acid  remain  stable.  Note,  furthermore,  that  for  all  continuously  monitored  pollutants,  the 
concentrations at the chimney, in 2018 were once again much lower than the regulatory limits: from a 
maximum of 97.9% below the regulatory limits for sulphur oxides to a minimum of 63.3% for nitrogen 
oxides. 
Concerning pollutants not continuously monitored, total emissions can be estimated on the basis of the 
results of the analyses performed during the year. In 2018, 120 kg of metals were emitted (154 in 2017), 
along with 0.56 kg of aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons (0.55 in 2017) and 22.7 mg of dioxins (40.9 in 2017). 
All values are at least 95% below regulations. 
The results of the emission measurements at Hera Group(cid:859)s waste-to-energy plants confirm that, since they 
are equipped with the best technologies available and run in the most efficient manner possible, these 
plants emit levels of particulate, dioxins and furans, aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons and metals that are
