Environmental impact assessments presented during the year 
The EIA and Screening procedures are accompanied by a series of environmental assessments of the effects 
of the works (both during construction and at the project stage) on the environment and on human health 
and well-being, based on the characteristics of the project and following analysis of the components 
involved in their ante operam condition. Interference with the following components was analysed in 
particular: atmosphere, water resources, soil and subsoil, flora, fauna and ecosystems, noise, human health 
and well-being, landscape and cultural heritage, settlement system and socio-economic conditions. 
The approach used involves performing specific model simulations in addition to qualitative and descriptive 
evaluations, using software and calculation algorithms, to obtain numerical data that can be compared with 
standards and limits set by industry regulations and so as to assess the significance of the impact. Model 
simulations are carried out in particular for the emission of pollutants and odorous substances into the 
atmosphere, and noise emissions. 
All the simulations carried out involve the precise characterization of the sources and the evaluation of the 
most disadvantageous scenario in order to make out a precautionary assessment. To assess the visual 
effect of the new works on the surrounding environment, and specifically for creating new lots/landfill 
sites, landscape assessments are carried out by using renderings and photomontages. In some cases the
