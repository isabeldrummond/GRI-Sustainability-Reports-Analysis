If we analyse the single accidents that occurred during 2018, there were no critical situations as regards 
how they occurred or their consequences. The only relevant case in Hera SpA was an accident that 
occurred to a blue-collar worker in the Water Department who was hit by a car while working in the middle 
of the road. Slipping and ongoing accidents are the two main causes of accidents. 
With regard to the mortal accident that occurred at the incinerator of Bologna in December 2010, following 
the request for committal to trial of a Hera Spa employee, a Frullo Energia Ambiente employee and a 
Herambiente employee notified in January 2014, the judge acquitted all three defendants of the crime 
charged by way of judgement of 24 October 2014 (cid:862)since the fact does not constitute an offence(cid:863). In 
October 2015, the public prosecutor challenged the decision: the hearing has not yet been set. 
With regard to the mortal accident in 2009 that occurred at the waste-to-energy plant of Forlì, following 
the committal to trial of three Hera Spa employees and one Herambiente employee, the preliminary 
hearing was held on 3 April 2014. At the hearings of 13 May and 30 May 2016, the witnesses and experts 
were  examined.  On  31  March  2017,  the  judge  ordered  the  conviction  of  the  defendants  granting 
suspension of the sentence. On 28 June 2017, the convicted employees filed an appeal against the first 
instance ruling. The date of the hearing is yet to be scheduled. 
Italian legislation (Italian Leg. Decree 81/2008) requires that workers be represented by Workers(cid:859) Safety 
Representatives. There are 72 Workers(cid:859) Safety Representatives in the Hera Group, covering 98% of the 
Group(cid:859)s  total  employees.  The  Workers(cid:859)  Safety  Representatives  (WSR)  are  individuals  chosen  by  the 
employees of a company according to the procedures established by law, who are required to monitor 
compliance with the rules on workers(cid:859) safety. Their task is to liaison with the employer, in order to report 
any non-compliance with the rules on health and safety and potential risks. With regard to suppliers, 
periodic checks on health and safety at work are carried out as set out in internal procedures. 
Occupational safety in the main Italian utility companies 
In  a  comparative  analysis  between  the  main  Italian  utilities,  Utilitatis  considered  frequency  index  of 
accidents  lasting  more  than  three  days:  Hera  ranks  second  among  the  6  multi-utilities  taken  into 
consideration.  In  2018,  Utilitalia  published  its  first  sustainability  report  which  summarises  the 
environmental performance of 127 Italian utility companies: Hera(cid:859)s 2017 result (17.1) is 49% lower than the 
average of the utilities considered (equal to 33.7).
