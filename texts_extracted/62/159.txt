As of 31 December 2018, the number of downloads reached over 257,600 and there are almost 309,000 
active users of the application proving the usefulness of the tool.  
In 2018, the Rifiutologo went online with new and smarter features as today the tool is able to provide 
citizens with the status of waste management services, geolocated for each address of residence. By 
searching for waste, in fact, users can find up-to-the-minute information on the individual local collections 
or the dates of door to door collections scheduled for their address, and even set up a reminder for the day 
and time of each collection. It is a great change for the service information that will be made available to 
users through the new customer site, as well as with the latest release of the app.  
In addition, the (cid:862)environmental reporting(cid:863) feature is even easier to use. Residents will be able to use it to 
report a waste management services, sending a real time picture to Hera(cid:859)s staff, and correspondingly 
receiving a report when the issue has been dealt with, besides customised alerts.  
In 2018, 38,950 (+31% compared to 2017) reports were sent concerning emptying bins, cleaning roads and 
removing abandoned waste; 4,272 suggestions were sent on new types of waste to be added to the 
database (-25% compared to 2017).  
The (cid:862)Scan barcode(cid:863) feature also popular. It helps users recognize materials by scanning the barcode 
printed on products and shows how to properly dispose of each package, by accessing an archive that as of 
31 December 2018 includes 1,366,000 barcodes of the most widely used products. For packages made of 
multiple materials, the app can provide instructions on where to dispose of each component. If a code isn(cid:859)t 
recognised, or if a type of waste is missing, citizens can report this via the Rifiutologo so that the missing 
information is added to the system. In 2018 there were 12,233 reports of bar codes sent by residents to 
update the database compared to 7,529 in 2017. The searches carried out by scanning barcodes increased 
from 282,804 in 2017 to 430,266 in 2018. 
With L’Acquologo, the entire water service is smartphone-accessible 
L(cid:859)Acquologo (The Waterologist), released in July 2016, is a free application on the local water service for 
residents who live in Hera(cid:859)s service area. It provides many useful features for users, from self-meter 
reading to checking data on the quality of the water in their municipality, and includes alerts for water 
network interruptions for ordinary maintenance work and reporting breakage or leakage of water on 
public land.  
In 2018, the application was downloaded 6,392 times for a total of 31,800 accesses. Residents with Hera 
bills can use the Acquologo to report their actual water consumption by easily reporting their meter 
reading. In 2018 5,915 readings were sent in using this system (up 9% compared to 2017).  
Hera manages the water service, providing good drinking water for its customers, that is complaint with 
regulatory requirements and carefully monitors the entire drinking water supply chain. To confirm this, 
users can use the Acquologo to consult the main quality data (average values) of the water supplied for 
each of the municipalities served by the multiutility, comparing them with the regulatory limits. In addition 
to this function, the application also shows the savings generated by the drinking tap water instead of 
bottled water. It is also possible to ask questions to experts and inquire about the local water service or the 
read the answers to frequently asked questions on the subject, in the (cid:862)Experts answer(cid:863) section. In 2018 
there were 54,090 accesses to the Acquologo pages on quality, 8,676 views of specific qualitative data and 
22 requests for further information through the (cid:862)Expert answers(cid:863) service. 
Experimentally, in some areas, the app can also be used to report major water leaks due to breakage of 
pipes under the road surface. After taking a picture and adding a brief text, users can send the report 
directly to Hera’s Emergency Service. By using geolocation, the system can rapidly detect the location of 
the report and provide it to the service personnel who will go to the site. During 2018, 251 reports were 
made using the app (photographic reports and calls to the toll-free number).
