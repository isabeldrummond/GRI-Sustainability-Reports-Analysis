Considering the 9,443 analyses carried out in 2018 on 230 purification plants, in 99.7% of the cases the 
results were compliant with the regulatory limits. The final values for this indicator in 2018 show a very 
satisfactory situation with excellent percentages of the total checks found compliant. Also in this case 
Triveneto benefits from the effects of the adaptation of the purification plant of Servola, in Trieste. The 
only cases that exceeded the authorized limits were in relation to purely incidental situations, largely 
compatible with the variability of the incoming quantities, the operating conditions and the structural 
condition of the plants.
