Supplier assessment and checking 
In 2018, for the purpose of facilitating the supplier monitoring and management activities, an automated 
system was introduced, care of the competent One-stop Social Security Point, for checking the INPS/INAIL 
and Cassa Edile contribution payment regularity of all the suppliers active and present in the Hera Group 
list. Specifically, using the coding and record file traceability of the parties grouped together in temporary 
joint  ventures  (representative  and  principals),  consortiums  and  specific  executing  companies,  sub-
contractors and the like relating to the individual service purchase document (order and/or contract), it was 
possible to carry out the control of the correct payment of the supplies and services only in the presence of 
complete regularity of the payments of the social security contributions.  
The periodic assessment makes it possible for the active supplier to receive an up-date of their scoring for 
each individual qualified commodity in the vendor rating system, with an increase in the event of total 
absence of anomalies, or with a decrease in relation to the seriousness of the anomalies detected. The 
assessment can always be consulted autonomously by the supplier in their specific area of the supplier 
portal.  
The scores have been divided up into three categories which contribute towards channelling the rotation, 
selection and invitation - by the individual buyers - of the qualified suppliers by specific commodity class 
affected by the private tenders carried out by the Hera Group. The score assigned to each supplier via the 
rating system influences the list of the firms invited to participate in tenders. Problematic suppliers are 
excluded from the under-threshold invitations unless they fall within the qualified brackets, via suitable 
corrective action and/or accurate improvement plans.

The supplier assessment management and monitoring model continues to ensure, via the maintenance of 
the reporting active since 2011, the quarterly frequency for the concession of the bonuses. By contrast, the 
methods for the calculation of the decreases takes place by means of the closure of the analysis of the 
anomalies and the definition of specific corrective actions. By means of the formalities introduced it is
