Health and safety 
Ever since its establishment, prevention and safety at work have been among Hera(cid:859)s founding principles; 
improving conduct and strengthening corporate awareness at all organisational levels towards health and 
safety is an ongoing target for the Group. 
Preventing and minimising health and safety risks is one of the commitments of the Hera Group(cid:859)s Policy 
that is inspired by the values for sustainable development expressed in the 2030 UN Agenda. 
Working to make the workplace safer and healthier is essential to improve quality and working conditions, 
but also to promote the Group(cid:859)s competitiveness. 
Throughout  these  years,  various  occupational  health  and  safety  projects  have  been  implemented, 
especially with regard to the culture of safety and to risk awareness. These initiatives - together with 
ongoing training and coaching of staff, specific actions for the improvement of vehicles and equipment, and 
timely analysis and investigation of accidents and near misses - have allowed us to achieve important 
results. The specific indicators, reported below and illustrated, are a tangible sign of the improvements 
attained by the Group in this important field. 
Accident indices 
  2016  2017  2018 
Frequency index  17.8  17.1  15.7 
 of which for ongoing accidents  4.0  3.3  4.1 
Severity index  0.56  1.04  0.52 
Rate index  2.9  2.8  2.6 
Average accident duration (days)  31.0  62.2  32.9 
Number of accidents  226  240  223 
of which for ongoing accidents  51  48  58 
The frequency index is the number of accidents per million hours worked. The severity index is the number of days of 
absence per accident divided by thousands of hours worked. The rate index is obtained by dividing the number of 
accidents by the number of workers, multiplied by 100. The data referring to accidents reported to INAIL which lasted 
more than three days were considered. 
The 2016 figures do not include the following companies: Acantho, Hera Trading, Hera Servizi Energia, Hera Comm 
Marche, Amga Energia & Servizi, Aliplast, Hestambiente, Herambiente Servizi Industriali, ASA, Sinergie, Amga Calore & 
Impianti, Aresgas.  
The accident frequency index at Group level further improved compared to the previous years (-8.2% 
compared to the previous year). The positive result obtained by the AcegasApsAmga Group (frequency 
index of 11.9 in 2018, down 42% compared to the previous year) improved the Group(cid:859)s overall figure. If we 
consider accidents lasting less than 3 days (39 in 2018), the frequency index drops to 18.4 (-4.7% compared 
to the previous year, on a like-for-like basis).  
The overall number of accidents for the Hera Group declined further (-12% compared to 2017). The number 
of days of absence due to accidents in 2018 was 1% lower than 2017 (net of the 2017 fatal accident). 
Accidents  suffered  by  women  in  the  Group  perimeter  amount  to  around  15%.  This  result  is  better 
compared to the percentage of female employees in the company and is partly due to the fact that the 
majority of blue-collar jobs are carried out by men. 
The number of ongoing accidents (while travelling to/from work) accounted for 26% of the total, dropping 
in absolute terms and as a percentage compared to the figure of the previous year. In 2018, the number of 
days of absence due to accidents attributable to ongoing accidents (while travelling to/from work) accounts 
for 21% of the total days of absence. The perimeters most affected are Herambiente (33.3% of the total) 
and Hera (30% of the total); in Marche Multiservizi they account for 12.9% while the percentage is marginal 
for the AcegasApsAmga perimeter: 5.8%.
