Despite this slight decrease in one of the major systems such as Bologna, for example, a saving of 14% in 
terms of nitrogen oxides and 7% of tonnes of CO  emitted was achieved compared to 2017, as the

renewable source WTE was used more than traditional boilers.

Emissions of the Imola cogeneration plant 
Again in 2018, the absolute specific emissions of the Imola cogeneration plant remained at extremely low 
levels: The environmental authorization for the Imola plant requires pollutant limits 75%/80% lower than 
national regulations for the pollutants most present in the flue gases (NO  and CO).

In 2018, the Imola Cogeneration Plant, with its 80 MW of electrical and 65 MW of thermal power, produced 
122,628 MWh of thermal power and 233,974 MWh of electricity. 
238,647 m3 of industrial water were consumed, of which 162,238 m3 were used to replenish the cooling 
tower, in compliance with the 210,000 m3 authorized by the EIA for that year.

The authorized emission limits are those set by the environmental compatibility decree issued by the Ministry of the Environment, 
Land and Sea DEC/DAS/2006/00142 of 15 February 2006 (only NO, CO and NH ) and the Integrated Environmental Authorization of

the province of Bologna of 11 April 2007, reference no. 124043, as amended. The values are the average continuously-measured 
values (for PM  the values are the average of the 8 analyses carried out). The limits reflect the hourly average (except for PM ).
