Wastewater purification quality can also be identified by monitoring the upgrade trends of urban areas, 
defined as areas in which population and production activities are concentrated to the extent that it is 
technically and economically acceptable to build an independent sewage treatment system. As set out by 
Directive 91/271/EEC, Legislative Decree 152/2006, and by the Water Protection Plan of the Regional 
Government of Emilia-Romagna, compliance requires that at least 95% of wastewater must be collected 
and the capacity of the purification plants must exceed the requirement for the population equivalents of 
the urban area with secondary or tertiary treatment (where necessary).

At Group level, at the end of 2018, 130 of 137 urban areas with more than 2,000 population equivalents 
(pe) have been upgraded to Legislative Decree 152/2006. Compliant urban areas amount to 92.2% of the 
total equivalent population. In Emilia-Romagna, this figure reaches 100%. In 2017, in fact, the Ministry of 
the Environment formally informed the Regional Government of Emilia-Romagna that it had withdrawn 
infringement proceedings 2014/2059, which therefore ended with compliance of the 206 urban areas 
>2,000 pe in the region, 101 of which are managed by Hera. In 2016, all of those urban areas achieved the 
quality objectives set out in the Water Protection Plan of the Regional Government of Emilia-Romagna(cid:859)s 
Regional Government, in terms of extension of the networks and the presence of treatment plants. As far 
as the Triveneto area is concerned, in 2018 the compliance was achieved for the Trieste Muggia urban area 
for a total of 256,882 population equivalents: the Servola plant started operation in June 2018 compliant 
with all discharge parameters. The Regional Government is awaiting formalities from the European Union 
to close the infringement procedure. In the Marche region, in the area served by the Group, 6 urban areas 
have been declared non-compliant and infringement proceedings 2014/2059 and 2009/2034 have been 
initiated. Action is already planned to bring each urban area into line with the requirements of Community 
and national legislation by 2021. By 2021, therefore, all urban areas with a population equivalent greater 
than 2000 in the service areas of Hera will have achieved compliance.  
In addition to the above, the Emilia-Romagna Regional Government, in its resolution 201/2016 on the 
adaptation of urban wastewater discharges, ruled to implement some additional measures in urban areas 
with more than 10,000 pe. These are structural adjustments relating, for example to the upgrade of 
undersized network floodways or more thorough nitrogen abatement. Although these situations do not 
undermine  the  compliance  of  those  urban  areas  to  Legislative  Decree  152/2006,  they  may  locally 
jeopardize the achievement of quality objectives for water bodies. Therefore, the Regional Government of 
Emilia-Romagna,  together  with  the  integrated  water  service  operators,  have  defined  timescales  and 
compliance criteria in the aforementioned resolution. Two projects have already been completed (Riccione 
and Cattolica, respectively in 2018 and 2017). Further 6 interventions are planned in 4 urban areas (Castel 
San Pietro Terme, San Giovanni in Persiceto, Budrio, Medicina) by 2021, 9 by 2024 and 16 by 2030. It 
should be borne in mind that a total of 26 urban areas are affected by the 33 improvement measures, some 
of which involve more than one intervention in different years.
