Hera  Spa  also  operates  four  turboexpanders,  located  in  Bologna,  Forli,  Ravenna  and  Ferrara, which 
generate electricity by exploiting the gas pressure differentials in the distribution network. 
Hera Spa has a 10% equity investment in Aloe Spa, the owner of 8 photovoltaic solar facilities in the 
provinces of Bologna, Ferrara, Ravenna, Brescia and Macerata, for a total capacity of 7.2 MW. The solar 
photovoltaic systems installed in Hera Spa(cid:859)s offices and facilities of Bologna, Ferrara, Imola, Faenza, Cesena 
and Ravenna add a total of 150 kW besides those installed at the Herambiente plants of Mordano (BO), 
Voltana (RA), Coriano (RN), Pozzilli (IS), and Rimini add a further 1.7 MW. AcegasApsAmga operates three 
photovoltaic solar facilities with a total output exceeding 100 kW, a turboexpander that generates 2 MW, a 
natural gas cogenerator with a nominal electricity output of 500 kW and two biogas cogenerators installed 
at major purification plants, that generate about 500 kW. 
Lastly, we note the new plant to produce energy from waste in S. Agata Bolognese, inaugurated in 2018, to 
produce biomethane from the organic fraction of separate waste collection (we estimate around 7.5 
million m3 of methane/year).  
In addition to the above renewable energy production plants, Hera also runs plants that efficiently generate 
energy (with nominal fuel utilization factors over 80%); among these, the 85 MW cogeneration plant at 
Imola stands out, as well as 9 smaller cogeneration and trigeneration plants, for an additional total 
installed capacity of 27 MW of electricity.

Electric power: renewable electric power includes 51% from waste-to-energy plants (the share considered 
renewable), biogas and photovoltaic; the Other item includes 49% from waste-to-energy plants (the share considered 
non-renewable). Thermal power: renewable thermal power includes 51% from waste-to-energy plants (the share 
considered renewable), biogas and geothermics; the Other item includes 49% from waste-to-energy plants (the share 
considered non-renewable) and thermoelectric power stations. 
The production of electricity and thermal energy  
The following table outlines the net electricity production of the Group(cid:859)s plants. The energy, net of 
consumption required by production (auxiliary consumption), may not match that fed into the grid since 
part of it may be used in other production processes.
