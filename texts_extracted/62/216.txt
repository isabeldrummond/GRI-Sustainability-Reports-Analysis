In 2018, the Hera Group again recorded an increase in its total number of customers. This result confirms 
the effectiveness of the growth strategy it adopted, i.e. the combined action of effective commercial 
initiatives and targeted corporate acquisitions. 
The increase of over 60,000 gas customers (+4.5%) was achieved thanks to a number of initiatives: 
commercial activity, the acquisition of successful businesses that apply the same values as the Hera Group 
uses in their approach to final customers, the enhancement of the experience in last resort markets (last 
resort supply and default service). As for the electricity service, the increase of over 85,000 customers 
(+8.9%)  was  achieved  thanks  to the excellent sales  results  for  all  customer  segments.  In  2018,  two 
companies active in energy sales in the Marche and Abruzzo regions joined the Hera Group: Blu Ranton and 
Sangro Servizi. The reduction in the number of municipalities served and their inhabitants for municipal 
waste management is due to some municipalities of the Forl√¨ area exiting the perimeter. 
Commercial policies 
Competitive  commercial  offerings  across  all  customer  segments  and  innovative  solutions  for  energy 
efficiency were at the heart of 2018(cid:859)s commercial policies. 
The organization of our contact channels, characterized by high service levels, is split among a widespread 
system of branches, target-based call centres and self-caring web channels. The development of digital 
technology is increasing over time, but without distracting energy and attention from traditional channels, 
because only by jointly leveraging all contact channels we will be able to put into practice the principle of 
customer proximity that has always guided the Group(cid:859)s initiatives. This is why the development of new 
stores in Livorno, Prato and Piacenza continued in 2018. As of 2018, considering the entire area served by 
Hera and its subsidiaries AcegasApsAmga, Marche Multiservizi and Estenergy, there were 116 branches. As 
far as the digital channel is concerned, in 2018 various (cid:862)smart(cid:863) payment methods, such as Amazon Pay or 
MasterPass, were enabled on the On Line Services and on the My Hera app. Using the app or the On-Line 
Services it is also possible to book an appointment at a branch office or ask to be contacted: the attention 
to digital channels has been appreciated by customers, as shown by the almost 100,000 downloads of the 
app in 2018.
