of ecosystems and companies», especially aimed at steering considerations and dialogue, through scientific 
research prospects and long-term trends, on the impact of climate change, and the development of change 
management activities associated with the implementation of Smart working. 
With regard to ethical values and corporate culture, the Corporate Social Responsibility and Code of Ethics 
in day-to-day management seminar continued in 2018, now in its fourth edition, involving 25 individuals 
with the aim of explaining the importance of the ethical aspects in the day-to-day activities establishing an 
increasingly larger group of experts «informed» on the Code. The initiative focused on the discussion of the 
cases of (cid:862)ethical dilemmas(cid:863) developing considerations with the colleagues of the various Companies and 
Group units which cover roles of responsibility and co-ordination. Group colleagues involved in previous 
editions took on the role of facilitators and brought their experience within the 4 teams that discussed how 
the dilemmas dealt with are specifically transferred into everyday life. A new aspect of the fifth and sixth 
edition  was  the  use  of  evidence  from  outside  of  Hera  which,  through  different  experiences  and 
perspectives, allowed the same issues to be viewed in a new way, thus generating value. Two days of 
training were organised and the satisfaction level of the sessions was appraised, reaching a very positive 
score: 4.6 out of 5.
