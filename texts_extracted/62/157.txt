and fauna ((cid:862)Habitats Directive(cid:863)). These directives created a consistent ecological network of protected 
areas in the European Union, known as Natura 2000.  
In the province of Ferrara, the two largest water collection plants, Pontelagoscuro and Stellata, on the Po 
river, are located within the Special Protection Area called (cid:862)Fiume Po da Stellata a Mesola e Cavo 
Napoleonico(cid:863). In the province of Ravenna, the Marina di Ravenna treatment plant is located within the EU 
Conservation  Area  (cid:862)Piallassa  Piombone(cid:863)  and  discharges  the  treated  wastewater  into  the  (cid:862)Piallassa 
Baiona(cid:863) special protection area.  
At these two plants, in order to protect biodiversity, Hera Group carries out acute toxicity tests on the 
purification plants.  
 
Case study 
Spreading innovation and digitalization 
Social innovation: The Heureka+ Project 
Heureka+, launched at the end of 2016, is a social innovation platform in which all employees can submit 
their innovative proposals and also jointly develop an idea with their colleagues, contribute to ideas or vote 
on the proposals of others. The Heureka+ platform permits direct and immediate interaction among 
employees to contribute to the Group(cid:859)s development and innovation. 
To  fine-tune  the  focus  of  the  proposals,  the  Heureka+  platform  has  been  organised  into  areas  or 
(cid:862)challenges(cid:863). During 2018, 3 challenges were launched, for which a total of 39 ideas were proposed: 
•  the first challenge was on health and safety (18 ideas);  
•  the second challenge was diversity management as a corporate ambassador of inclusive culture (5 
ideas); 
•  the third challenge was the opportunity to offer new services to citizens in the field of waste 
management services (16 ideas). 
Among the ideas received during previous editions and challenges, including those listed above, several 
ideas were implemented in 2018: 
•  Car sharing app: a web application similar to Blablacar for publishing or viewing car sharing 
opportunities between Hera locations; 
•  Office 365 in the Cloud: installation of Office 365 to manage email in the cloud; 
•  Smart working: possibility to work at a location other than the assigned one, for one day a week; 
•  Heracover: making covers for mobile phones with environmentally sustainable materials; 
•  M’illumino di Led: the improvement of outdoor lighting with the use of LED technology; 
•  Circular  economy  applied  to  a  public  lighting  system,  to  measure  the  economic  and  metric 
circularity of public lighting systems. 
In addition, the following proposals are currently being implemented: 
•  Change the ending in the office: increasing separate waste collection in Hera(cid:859)s offices; 
•  Hera without paper jams: competitions among Departments to reduce the quantity of prints and 
photocopies; 
•  Fast & Suistainable: competitions among organisational units to reduce the use of the most 
polluting fuel in the company fleet; 
•  Be safe drive smart: integrated systems to reduce smartphone use when driving. 
Further challenges and improved functions of the Heureka+ platform will be launched during 2019.
