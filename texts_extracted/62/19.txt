services, public lighting and district heating. The residual percentage of EBITDA for the smart use of energy 
is connected to the spreading of renewable energy achieved both with commercial activities and through 
the production of energy from renewable sources. 
Lastly, the Hera Group generates about 13% of (cid:862)shared value(cid:863) EBITDA with reference to innovation, 
digitalisation  and  its  contribution  to  an  inclusive  development  focused  on  the  environment  and 
stakeholders. With regard to the (cid:862)spreading of innovation and digitalisation(cid:863), shared value was achieved 
also  through  telecommunication  services,  via  the  Acantho  company,  and  through  projects  for  the 
digitalisation of operational and data analysis processes with a view to their optimisation. (cid:862)Economic 
development  and  social  inclusion(cid:863)  was  especially  achieved  through  generated  employment  and  the 
outsourcing of environmental services to social cooperatives. This allows disadvantaged individuals to be 
employed and also leads to economic benefits for the Public Administration (lower welfare costs). Lastly, in 
terms of (cid:862)air and soil protection(cid:863), the purchase of vehicles with a lower environmental impact and the 
expansion of the volume served by district heating were privileged.
