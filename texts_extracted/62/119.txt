In 2018, actions to promote the digital behaviour of the Group(cid:859)s customers continued. 
For example, in the 2017-2018 school year, the Digi e Lode project was launched (see the (cid:862)Case Study(cid:863) 
section), which encourages the virtuous behaviour of Hera(cid:859)s customers by using the digital services offered 
(online services, electronic bills, applications for mobile devices, etc.). Specifically, the project financed 
school digitalization projects for first-degree public and state-authorized primary and secondary schools in 
the  Bologna,  Modena,  Ferrara,  Forl√¨-Cesena,  Ravenna  and  Rimini  areas  with  Euro  100,000  for  their 
digitalization projects to the benefit of students. Given the success of the initiative, Hera has launched a 
new edition for the 2018-2019 school year and has scheduled its extension in the Triveneto and Marche 
regions (see section (cid:862)What we will do(cid:863) at the beginning of this chapter).  
In 2018, Acantho(cid:859)s customers(cid:859) subscription to the digital bill service reached 60% of total bills issued, 
avoiding the printing of around 165,600 sheets of paper. In addition, Acantho decides not to produce 
reports on electronic customer traffic on paper; those who so wish can consult the customer portal. 
Overall, the digitalization of these two processes saved more than 1,682 kg of CO  equivalent per year.
