A key topic for the purpose of preventing accidents and improving workplace health and safety conditions 
is the ability to report, collect and analyse accidents and near misses. Near misses are accidental events 
that could have potentially generated an accident. Their correct analysis and examination prevents the 
occurrence of accidents. The Hera Group places great emphasis on correctly reporting, analysing and 
examining near misses. The trend of near misses is monitored on a monthly basis to check compliance with 
the specific objectives assigned to the various departments and business units.
