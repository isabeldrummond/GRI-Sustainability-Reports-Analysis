The indicator concerns the plants that serve over 10,000 population equivalents (the volumes treated in these plants 
are 87% of the total wastewater treated) and expresses the ratio between the measured concentration of BOD5, COD, 
TSS, ammoniacal nitrogen, phosphorus and total nitrogen, and the corresponding maximum concentrations permitted 
by Legislative Decree 152/2006. 
The efficiency in removing pollutants to comply with the regulatory limits, as expressed by the indicator in 
the chart, is related to the purification capacity of the plant and the technologies used. Low indicator values 
indicate higher purified water quality. At Group level, this indicator averages 35% of regulatory limits, 
taking into account BOD5, COD, TSS, ammoniacal nitrogen, phosphorus and total nitrogen, and 26% 
excluding phosphorus and total nitrogen. The indicator that expresses the efficiency of removal of the main 
pollutants improved slightly compared to previous years, also due to the fact that some large upgrade 
projects started in previous years are nearing completion. In particular, with regard to the Triveneto area, 
in the first few months of 2018 the new biological section of the Servola purification plant in Trieste was 
launched, which went into operation in June 2018. This has allowed us to improve significantly the results 
compared to previous years, when the plant was only primary chemical-physical. A further improvement is 
expected in 2019, as 2018 was a year of transition with the first half of higher values. 
 
The following table shows the main improvement and expansion measures of purification plants completed 
during the year and in progress.
