In particular, during 2018, a total of 55 public invitations for tenders were announced, for a total starting 
price of more than Euro 183.5 million: of these 171.5 million, or 93.5% of the total value of the invitations 
issued in 2018, envisaged the awarding method according to the most economically advantageous bid 
criterion. The average score assigned to the sustainability aspects came to 32.1 (+18% compared with 
2017). 
In 2018, 8 public tender invitations were issued with awarding to the largest discount for around Euro 12 
million, equal to approximately 6.5% of the total value of the public tender invitations issued in the year. 
Furthermore, 4 public tenders for qualification systems were held, which were not included in the total: the 
legislation in fact requires that the tender amount and the award method be defined as and when in the 
subsequent negotiation procedures.

The economically most advantageous bid award method is applicable (if the tender procedures permit 
recourse to this method) to the entire purchasing cycle, with a clear predominance for purchases of 
services and work, given the already high standardisation of the technical specifications with regard to the 
sphere of materials supplies and in some cases of work. We would like to point out that 77.4% of the value 
of contracts managed by the Hera Spa Procurement and Tenders Department, excluding AcegasApsAmga 
and Marche Multiservizi, to which the most economically advantageous bid criterion is applicable took 
place according to this method, in place of the largest discount. At Group level, by contrast, this figure was 
72.8% (+5 percentage points with respect to 2017). In AcegasApsAmga the figure reached 64.1% in 2018, 
almost 18 percentage points more than in 2017, while in Marche Multiservizi during 2018, 30.2% of the 
value of the adjudications took place according to the economically most advantageous bid method, down 
slightly with respect to 2017.
