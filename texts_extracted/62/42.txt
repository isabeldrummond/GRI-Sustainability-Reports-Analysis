plants, the estimate was carried out by considering the carbon dioxide during combustion of the non-biodegradable 
portion of waste and of the other fuels used in the plant; the gas network losses were estimated and considered 
completely dispersed in the atmosphere - the GWP considered is 25 for methane and 298 for N O, (4th Assessment 
2
Report IPCC). On the other hand, the NIR 2017 coefficients of ISPRA for the location-based method and the 2016 AIB 
European Residual Mix for the market-based method (expressed in CO ) were used to estimate electricity 
2
consumption emissions (Scope 2). The indicator does not include the Ravenna waste disposal plant for special waste 
and the Trieste trigeneration plant, the emissions of which can be estimated at 3.5% of the total. 
In 2018, the Hera Group released 1.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (-7.2% compared to 2017). Direct 
emissions (scope 1) amounted to 1.3 million tonnes, down 5.0% compared to 2017 mainly due to (i) a 
reduction in gas network losses (-22.3%); (ii) a reduction in emissions from landfills (-12.0%), which was 
affected by lower landfill use for the disposal of municipal waste and; (iii) a reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions  from  district  heating  (-4.0%)  due to  lower energy  production,  particularly electricity,  from 
cogeneration plants (as indicated in the relevant paragraph). 
Emissions indirectly caused by electricity consumption (scope 2) amounted to 148 thousand tonnes, down 
compared to 2017 (-23.4%), as a result of the extension of Hera Spa(cid:859)s choice – made in 2017 to purchase 
electricity  from  renewable  sources  –  to  AcegasApsAmga  and  Marche  Multiservizi  (57%  of  the  total 
electricity consumption of the entire Group). This has allowed the Group to save about 200 thousand 
tonnes of CO2, 13% of the Group(cid:859)s total. The value of the scope 2 emissions indicated above is calculated 
taking into account the company(cid:859)s energy purchase choices ((cid:862)market based(cid:863) method), i.e. the share of 
renewable  energy  purchased  with  Guarantee  of  Origin  (GO)  certificates  and  the  share  of  electricity 
purchased without certificates. For this second component, the emission factor relative to the national 
residual mix was used. The scope 2 emissions calculated with the location based method are equal to 
234,638 tonnes. This value is based on the company(cid:859)s location and therefore uses the average emission 
factor of the national fuel mix, without taking into account the company(cid:859)s purchase choices.  
As part of the ISO 50001 management system, 303 energy consumption reduction measures have been 
defined  by  Hera  Spa,  InRete,  AcegasApsAmga  and  Marche  Multiservizi,  some  of  which  have  been 
implemented and some of which will be implemented by 2020, and which achieve an overall savings of 
over 12,315 toe/year (over the 2020 target of reducing consumption by 5% compared to 2013) and over 21 
thousand tonnes of CO  per year. In addition, 69 other energy efficiency improvement measures have been 
2
implemented, are in progress or are planned by Herambiente, Hera Servizi Energia and Hera Luce, for a 
total of 12,095 toe/year of overall savings, reaching approximately 21 thousand tonnes of CO  per year.

The ratio between carbon dioxide emissions and the Group(cid:859)s gross operating margin shows for 2018 a 
decrease compared to 2017 (-11%) mainly due to the reasons described above as well as the trend in 
EBITDA  (+12%  in  the  three-year  period  considered).  The  ratio  versus  revenues  has  also  significantly 
decreased in 2017-2018 (-15%), from 288 to 245 t of CO  per million Euro.
