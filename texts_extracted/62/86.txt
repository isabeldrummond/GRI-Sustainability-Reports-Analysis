for line losses in Emilia-Romagna was 9.1 m3/km/day in 2017, substantially in line with the average of 8.3-
8.4 m3/km/day found by the European Environment Agency on a group of 32 European utilities that took 
part in the study entitled (cid:862)Performance of water utilities beyond compliance(cid:863). It is an even more significant 
value if compared with the average of 24 m3/km/day of the Italian utilities for 2017 (Source: Utilitalia, 2017 
Sustainability Report).

Non-invoiced water for the main Italian utilities 
Utilitatis performed a comparative analysis of the main Italian utility companies in terms of non-invoiced 
water per kilometre of network. Hera ranks second among the 12 companies considered. In 2018, Utilitalia 
published its first sustainability report which summarises the environmental performance of 127 Italian 
utility companies: Hera(cid:859)s 2017 result (10.2) is 57% lower than the average of the utilities considered (23.8).
