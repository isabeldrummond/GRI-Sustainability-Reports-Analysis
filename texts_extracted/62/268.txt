Part-time  arrangements, as  regulated  by current  labour  agreements,  are considered  a  valid  tool  for 
responding to labour flexibility needs both in terms of organisational and employee needs. They are 
characterised by the voluntariness, reversibility and compatibility with the technical, organisational and 
productive needs of the company and the needs of workers. Family and health needs, the need to help 
others with disabilities, and cases of serious illness (duly certified as such) are our priority considerations in 
assessing applications. The persons to whom staff members report must consider how viable the contracts 
the applicants seek are in terms of corporate needs: if it is concluded that the contract is viable, the 
changes will be made. 
In 2018, 71 requests for part-time arrangements were submitted; all were accepted. Preference towards 
part-time work among female workers continued to be strong.
