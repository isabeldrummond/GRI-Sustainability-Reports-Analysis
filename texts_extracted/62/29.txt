In addition to the initiatives of the Energy Improvement Plan, we must also consider 69 more energy 
efficiency measures implemented, in progress or planned (45 of which have already been completed) by 
Herambiente,  Hera  Servizi  Energia  and  Hera  Luce  on  waste  disposal  plants,  condominiums  or  other 
buildings, for cogeneration plants and public lighting systems. These measures will save 12,095 toe per year 
(9,219 of which already achieved, equal to 386 thousand GJ). In addition, in 2018, AcegasApsAmga Servizi 
Energetici completed 62 projects in the climate sector and 16 projects in the condominium sector for an 
overall saving of 406 toe. Planned for the following years are 56 projects in the climate sector and 16 
projects in the condominium sector for a total of 773 toe. 
 
The white certificates mechanism was created in Italy in 2005 as an incentive tool for energy efficiency and 
is based on Energy Efficiency Certificates (TEE) to which an economic value is attributed. These certificates 
are obtained by implementing measures that provide certified and measurable energy savings. The system 
sets saving requirements for gas and electricity distributors, and assigns goals to be achieved each year.  
Italian Ministerial Decrees 11/01/2017 and 10/05/2018 changed the procedures for accessing the white 
certificates mechanism, and redefined the obligations of distributors for the 2017/2020 period. These 
changes have significantly impacted the system, where uncertainty remains concerning the ability to 
generate sufficient certificates to meet obligations. The market value of the securities has been curbed, 
even in the event of a shortage of supply, by introducing a cap on the resources of the community involved 
in the system, in the form of a tariff contribution granted to obligated entities to cover their costs, a 
parameter that from 2018 may amount to a maximum of Euro 250 per certificate. 
In order to fulfil its obligations, Inrete Distribuzione Energia avails itself of Hera S.p.A. which it operates as 
an ESCO, which continues the activity in the procurement of white certificates as it started more than ten 
years ago. Furthermore, Hera S.p.A. has developed agreements with trade associations in the areas it 
serves, collaborating with companies within the scope of the obligations required by Legislative Decree 
102/14 on Energy Audits. At the end of 2018, 7 agreements were in place with trade associations and 20 
agreements with external establishments. 
In 2018 Hera S.p.A. won the Energy Efficiency Award promoted by CESEF in collaboration with RSE and 
Galletti. 
As part of the initiatives to promote energy efficiency, Hera S.p.A. has also started cooperating with a team 
of researchers from the Politecnico di Milano, made up of experts in behavioural psychology and statistical 
sciences, which, in addition to providing a useful contribution to design the initiatives, has the skills 
necessary to develop scientifically valid programs to measure and verify savings. The collaboration involves 
the validation, from the point of view of the savings obtained, of energy optimization measures in homes, 
in industrial plants, in the tertiary sector and in public administration, due not to replacing or implementing
