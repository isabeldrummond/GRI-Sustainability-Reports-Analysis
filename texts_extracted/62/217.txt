Hera Comm’s Sales Network and Commercial Conduct 
Hera  Comm(cid:859)s  commercial  strategy  for  the  sale  of  energy  services  to  small  and  medium  customers 
(households and companies) relies on commercial partners that operate across various sales channels. 
In 2018, Hera Comm confirmed its fundamental guidelines, i.e.: 
•  the selection of agencies according to the principles and methods defined in the Group(cid:859)s quality 
system; 
•  having all partners sign the agency mandate, which includes the Group(cid:859)s Code of Ethics; 
•  specific training provided to agency managers and to their agents by Hera Comm staff; 
•  identification of door-to-door agents who must show their identity card to customers they visit; 
•  periodical mentoring at final customer premises by Hera Comm staff in order to assess the conduct 
of the sales network; 
•  final customer surveys to monitor the quality of the sales network(cid:859)s operations. 
In addition, the monitoring of sales activities was also extended to branch offices and inbound call centres.  
The extension of the commercial network continues as in 2017 and led to opening new points in Livorno, 
Prato and Piacenza. The commitment to remain close to customers is manifested not only by opening new 
stores but also by periodically checking the adequacy of the existing ones, in terms of location and size, in 
order to optimize the presence and coverage of the area in line with the growth in the number of 
customers and services offered. 
At the end of 2018, the sales channel dedicated to small business customers had more than 120 business 
agents, active in 9 regions of Italy, with specialist training in energy markets and related offers. 
The proximity to our customers and their protection remain the fundamental principles of Hera Comm(cid:859)s 
sales activity. In addition to measures to care for unwanted activations and contracts, as required by 
ARERA(cid:859)s resolution 153/2012/R/com as amended, Hera Group has added other safeguards to those already 
required by ARERA:
