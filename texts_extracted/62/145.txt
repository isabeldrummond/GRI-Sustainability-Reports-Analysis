far below the emission limits. Compared with the other parameters, subject to continuous monitoring, at 
plants equipped with the double reaction sulphur oxide reduction system (Bologna, Ferrara, Forlì, Modena, 
and Rimini) the concentrations were not only well below the regulatory limits, but also below the limits 
set by local authorities, which are much more stringent than national regulations. 
Legislative Decree 133/2005 requires continuous monitoring of flue emissions for seven parameters. In 
addition, in the Ferrara, Forlì, Modena and Rimini plants, mercury is also continuously monitored.
