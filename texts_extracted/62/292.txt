The Group sets itself the objective of continuing to show preference, in place of the largest discount, for 
the economically most advantageous bid and to assign a relevant score to the environmental and social 
sustainability aspects in the tenders held with this method. 
Within  the  ISO  50001  certification  process  for  Hera  SpA  a  clause  was  envisaged  in  the  standard 
specifications which obliges the technical contact individual - if they detect that the subject matter of the 
purchase  has  a  significant  impact  on  the  energy  consumption  of  the  Group  -  to  proceed  with  the 
assessment of the energy efficiency requirements on the basis of an Energy Management document useful 
for the assessment of the energy impact. 
In the private tenders the Hera Group, excluding Marche Multiservizi, invited an average of 21 suppliers for 
each set of negotiations (weighted average on purchase volumes) confirming the approach of the Group 
based on an open and transparent competition between the suppliers on a consistent basis with the 
guidelines of current legislation.
