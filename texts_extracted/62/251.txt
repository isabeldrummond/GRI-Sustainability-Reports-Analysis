•  Configuration: Is distribution by seniority and position consistent with the organisation(cid:859)s demands? 
Is  the  demographic  structure  appropriate?  Is  the  balance  between  operational/management 
positions consistent with future challenges? 
Hera Group’s workforce 
2018 confirmed the consolidation of the Group(cid:859)s organisational and corporate structure, both through 
expansion of the scope of reference and through ongoing attention towards simplifying the operating 
mechanisms.  
More specifically, the companies Blu Ranton (6 workers) and Megas Net (19 workers), operating in the 
market area, were added to the scope of the Group during the year. At the same time, the following 
companies left the Group(cid:859)s scope: Medea (21 workers), operating in the market area, and the waste 
management services branch of Hera Spa to Alea Ambiente. 
As at 31 December 2018, the total workers with open-ended contracts in Group companies amounted to 
8,622, while workers with fixed-term contracts amounted to 155.

Data as at 31 December. 
The decrease in managers (5 units) is due to 1 recruitment, 5 moves from the role of middle manager to 
manager, and the exit of 11 managers during 2018. The number of middle managers dropped by 1 unit, 
which is the result of 2 new entries, 25 promotions to middle manager, 7 moves from the role of middle 
manager to manager, and 23 exits. The increase in white-collar workers is due to the entry of 238 new 
workers (21 of whom as a result of changes in scope) and 5 level changes, offset by 207 exits. The number 
of blue-collar workers increased by 9 units since 2018 due to the entry of 222 blue-collar workers (4 of 
whom as a result of changes in scope) and to the exit of 283 blue-collar workers and 61 moves from the 
role of blue-collar worker to white-collar worker. The reduction of 61 open-ended contract workers is 
therefore the result of changes in both scope and turnover.
