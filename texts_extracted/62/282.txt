The table provides a breakdown of suppliers by goods/service class. Some suppliers may belong to more than one 
class and, consequently, the sum of the individual items does not tally with the total number of suppliers. Excluding 
Marche Multiservizi. 
More than 60% of the total suppliers on the list are qualified for the supply of services and work, while 
more than 63% (around 3,250 suppliers) had at least one contract active in 2018. 
The main activities outsourced by the Hera Group within the sphere of waste management services 
concern the refuse collection services using rear-loading or small-load compactors, the door-to-door refuse 
collection service, street cleaning and washing (manual and mechanised), the cleaning of street refuse skips 
and the management of the Separate waste collection centres. With regard to the grid services, the 
company mainly resorts to outside suppliers for the activities concerning highly specialised maintenance, 
plant engineering activities and meter services (readings, closures, initialisations, etc.). Furthermore, facility 
management (global service), call centre, commercial and contact activities are outsourced. 
In terms of economic value, in 2018 Hera commissioned purchases for Euro 911.8 million, of which over 
Euro 12 million for purchases in other European nations outside Italy.  
The impacts generated by the supply chain of the Hera Group mainly concern the observance of the health 
and safety in the workplace standards, the social sustainability aspects and the environmental impacts of 
the outsourced activities.  
 
Raw material supplies 
In 2018, natural gas sold by the Group sales companies controlled by Hera Comm in 2018 was purchased 
for around 14% from Eni Gas & Power, approximately 39% was purchased from Edison, around 3% from 
Enel Trade, 3% from Other suppliers and 41% via Hera Trading (which, in turn, purchased spot gas on the 
main European hubs and at the virtual exchange point). 
With regard to the electricity market, 45% of sales to final customers on the eligible and protected market 
were covered by bilateral purchases from other operators, with 55% sourced on the electricity market. The 
methods for trading electricity, both via sourcing on the electricity exchange and, more generally through 
bilateral agreements, do not allow for the tracing of the sources of energy in order to be able to certify the 
type of production upstream.
