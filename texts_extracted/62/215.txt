ER  T  M 
AcegasApsAmga, 100% Marche Multiservizi); 43% at end 2019. 
• Update the electricity grid resilience plan implemented in 2018 and execute the 
interventions planned on primary/secondary substations to automate the network, improving       
the continuity and quality of service.  
• Emergency gas services: maintain a much higher level than ARERA requirements for the

percentage of calls answered within 120 seconds and arrival at call location within 60 minutes. 
• Ensure that call centre quality levels and average waiting times at branch offices are in line 
ER  T  M 
with those of 2018.  
• Further improve compliance with commercial quality standards for gas, electricity, water 
and district heating services. Further reduce the compensation paid to customers for non- ER  T  M 
compliance with standards.
