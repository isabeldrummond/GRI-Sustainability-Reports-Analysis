The consumption data refers to the Group(cid:859)s main purification plants (>100,000 pe), to the largest district heating 
plants in Emilia-Romagna, to the six waste-to-energy plants of Emilia-Romagna and to that of Pozzilli, to the main 
industrial waste treatment plants (excluding the F3 waste-to-energy plant) and to Herambiente(cid:859)s composting and 
recovery plants. 
In 2018, the Group(cid:859)s water consumption amounted to 1.2 million m3 of water drawn from the aqueduct, 
537 thousand m3 of surface water and 93 thousand m3 of groundwater. In the Group(cid:859)s main purification 
plants, 84% of the water required for the process is reused (internal and external reuse), thus reducing 
overall consumption. Also in the waste-to-energy plants of the Emilia-Romagna area and in the plants for 
the  treatment  of  industrial  waste,  is  used  water  from  the  purification  plants  for  28%  of  the  total 
consumption. 
Wastewater purification quality 
In 2017, the Hera Group operated the sewage and purification service in 231 municipalities, 49 of which as 
Marche Multiservizi and 18 of which as AcegasApsAmga while the coverage of the sewage service for all 
urban areas is equal to 92% of the needs of the territory (population equivalents).  
In 2018, the purification service covered 91% of population equivalents in the areas served by the Group.  
These values are very positive if compared with the average of the Italian utilities that were included in the 
Utilitatis study in 2016, at 90% for the sewage network and 88% for the purification network. Concerning 
the country-wide values, the latest data available are for 2007, when 85% of Italians was served by the 
sewage  network  and  70%  by  a  purification  plant.  (Source:  2009  Utilitatis  Blue  Book).  Assessing  the 
percentage of wastewater treated compared to the total, the Italian average in 2015 was 89.9%, with 
negative peaks for the regions of southern Italy such as 68.5% in Sicily or 76.9% in Calabria (Source: ISPRA). 
The Hera Group treated over 382 million m3 of wastewater in 2018, compared to 364 million in 2017 as a 
result of the low rainfall that year and, therefore, of the lower inflow of rainwater. The sewage networks 
that feed those plants are generally mixed-type systems, and the volumes treated therefore depend on 
rainfall.  
The sewage network Hera Spa operates is approximately 14,800 km long and about 53% of the total (55% 
in 2014) is a mixed-type system. At Group level, the sewage network operated is 18,626 kilometres long, 
and 57% of the total is a mixed-type network.
