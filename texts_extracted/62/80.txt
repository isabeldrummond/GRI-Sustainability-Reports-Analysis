industry, from the purification of wastewater, from construction, from the commercial and services sector, 
and from the healthcare sector. Herambiente has over 25 plants exclusively equipped for the disposal of 
special waste, with around 5 million tonnes managed in 2018 (including sub-products deriving from the 
Group(cid:859)s plant activities).  
Herambiente(cid:859)s plants, as regards special waste, include, inter alia, plants such as:  
•  Disidrat  (Ravenna)  -  treatment  plant  for  pumpable  sludge,  shovellable  material,  ash,  soil 
(authorized for 150,000 t/year)  
•  F3 (Ravenna) - incinerator for special waste, including hazardous waste, of industrial origin (40,000 
t/year) 
•  HASI waste storage and pretreatment centre (Herambiente Servizi Industriali), Ravenna - facility for

Since 2018, municipal waste has also included the volumes of trade portions that were previously included in 
marketplace waste. Therefore, the data at 31 December 2017 was been restated, between municipal and marketplace 
waste, to match the classification of the current year. Municipal waste treated in the Group(cid:859)s plants (4,945 tonnes in 
2018) as well as municipal waste collected in the municipalities where Hera manages the municipal waste service, 
includes about 369 thousand tonnes collected by other parties in the provinces of BO, FE, FC, GO, MO, PD, RN, UD, VE 
and in the State of San Marino. 
Analysis of the quantitative data shows a decrease in waste sold due to marketplace waste, down 5.0%, 
mitigated  by  the  growth  in  municipal waste.  The  drop  in  market  volumes  is  a  consequence  of  the 
temporary reduction in plant availability. 
Municipal waste shows an overall increase of 1.6%, in particular due to the increase of quantities of 
separate waste and waste from beaches while the quantities of non-separate waste decrease.
