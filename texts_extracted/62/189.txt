During the last quarter of 2018, the performances of the financial markets were influenced by the 
commercial tensions between the United States and China, by the global economic slowdown and in the 
specific case of the Italian market by the uncertainties regarding approval of the financial manoeuvre. The 
Hera stock ended 2018 with a performance of -8.7%, in any event better than the Italian stock market (-
16.7%), reaching an official price of Euro 2.674, compared with a price of Euro 2.929 at the end of 2017 
(level once gain achieved in the first few weeks of 2019). Capitalisation came to around Euro 4.0 billion, 
confirming itself amongst the 40 highest capitalisations of the Italian share list. The positive performance of 
the Hera stock, compared with the trend of the Italian market, was supported by the appreciation of the 
investors for the business plan presented to the financial community in January 2018 and by the sound 
fundamentals emerging during the year at the time of the publication of the quarterly and annual results.
