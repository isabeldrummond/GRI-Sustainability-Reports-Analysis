Tenders  for  contracts  awarded  on  the  basis  of  the  most  economically  advantageous  bid 
approach

Code of Ethics.

commitment(cid:863), (cid:862)quality of services(cid:863) and (cid:862)economic value(cid:863), sustainability criteria have been defined on the 
basis  of  the  experience  acquired  in  managing  calls  for  tenders  according  to  the  most  economically 
advantageous bid method, of doctrine, of regulations on the matter and in line with Hera Group objectives.
