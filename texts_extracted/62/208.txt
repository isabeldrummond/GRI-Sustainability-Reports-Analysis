Thanks to the work done, in 2018 Hera(cid:859)s positive visibility in the press (especially the national press) 
increased over the previous year, while the number of articles was practically stable: 448 out of around 
6,500 articles published globally. The large number of articles published reveal the attention by the press 
and  the  Group(cid:859)s  firm  involvement  in  national  and  local  dynamics,  whether  specific  or  general,  and 
demonstrate the role of the company among the nation(cid:859)s leading players. From a qualitative standpoint, 
the positivity concerning Hera increased and settled at very high levels: 94% on national publications and 
80% on local publications. Among the topics that contributed to this positive feedback: the business plan, 
the economic results, the good performance of the share and market confidence in Hera shares, the 
acquisitions, innovative projects such as the construction of the biomethane production plant in the 
Bologna area, the welfare and HR management corporate policies, the broad offer of educational activities 
for schools, sustainability reporting and related projects, the new waste collection services started in a 
number of areas, and sponsorships. 
For years now, the trend of critical articles has settled at very low levels and continued to drop in 2018: 
below 1% for the national press and 8.5% for local press, quite a logical result if we consider the nature of 
the Group(cid:859)s activities and the sensitivity of the public opinion. Negativity in the local media regarded the 
protests for the expansion of the Imola, Baricella and Finale Emilia landfills, the inconveniences resulting 
from the reorganisation of waste collection services in Ferrara with introduction of the quantity-based 
tariff, especially during the first half of the year.  
Pending legal proceedings 
In addition to the disputes involving customers and suppliers which are discussed in the corresponding 
sections of this report, at the end of 2018, an additional 586 disputes were pending mainly concerning 
disconnections of gas supplies to late-paying final customers who, having signed contracts with salespeople 
for the redelivery points on the distribution network managed by Inrete, were subject to administrative 
termination as governed by Arera legislation (specifically the Consolidated Law on Gas Delinquency). The 
remaining disputes refer to different issues regarding claims for damages associated with the management 
of the services performed by Hera or Group companies. During 2018, 1,037 disputes were settled: 210 with 
customers, 21 with suppliers and 806 with other stakeholders. 
With regard to the networks and plants managed by the Group, the following litigation proceedings 
brought by associations, citizens and/or other parties/bodies are reported. 
With reference to the criminal proceedings pending before the Forlì Court, involving Herambiente as owner 
of the Forlì waste-to-energy plant, after the positive conclusion in July 2011 of the appeal to the Supreme 
Court of Cassation furthered by the Public Prosecutor related to the attachment of the plant requested 
since it was deemed hazardous, the proceedings continued during 2012 against a number of Herambiente
