The value of supplies from local companies reached 69% of total results, coming to Euro 632 million (+7% 
compared to the previous year), while the estimated employment generated amounted to around 8,100 
workers. This figure confirms the Group(cid:859)s key role in developing the local area.  
Investments in innovation totalled approximately Euro 62.4 million for projects in four areas: smart city, 
utility 4.0 and customer experience. The Group continued to develop customer relation digital channels in 
2018.  The  new  MyHera  app  was  launched  for  residential  customers  which  reached  100  thousand 
downloads.  
Air protection confirms its positive results thanks to the emissions of the Group(cid:859)s ten waste-to-energy 
plants: very low levels once again in 2018 and on average 86% lower than legal limits. Furthermore, 
regarding soil protection, the planning implemented by HeraTech in 2018 reused 68% of total soil. 
 
To  conclude,  also  in  the  light  of  the  positive  results  reported  in  this  document,  we  can  state  that 
sustainability reporting guarantees Hera Group(cid:859)s well-known and consolidated (cid:862)external(cid:863) value, but at the 
same time has paved the way, right from the very start, to creating a highly significant (cid:862)internal(cid:863) value. The 
organisation has been able to develop significant cultural growth exactly on this latter aspect, with tangible 
and gradual improvements in daily business management and in the relations it holds with stakeholders, by 
effectively monitoring the company(cid:859)s (cid:862)what(cid:863) and (cid:862)how(cid:863). The new strategic approach to creating shared 
value has smoothed the path to a new phase focusing on (cid:862)why(cid:863). This has led us to renewing our reporting 
and, in our opinion, will be able to sustain the future growth of our company.
