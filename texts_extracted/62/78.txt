Despite its quantitative predominance, special waste becomes almost invisible in the collective imagination 
as it is far removed from daily life and also because of the different way it must be treated, by law. In fact, 
municipal waste must be collected and disposed of in the Region in which it is generated at a cost, for the 
general public, that is pre-set by the regulatory authorities. Conversely, special waste must be disposed of 
by and at the expense of its producer and therefore companies use the operators that best cater to their 
needs, also economically speaking. 
Special  waste  is  therefore  often  transported  quite  far  from  where  it  is  actually  produced:  to  other 
provinces, other regions or even abroad. Over the years, this lower visibility, often coupled with a lower 
degree  of  traceability,  has  been  reflected  in  strategic  planning  deficiencies  for  disposal  plants,  and 
unfortunately this tends to lead to illegal forms of disposal, which for years has filled the coffers of the so-
called environmental mafia. 
The Emilia-Romagna Regional Government, in its Regional Waste Management Plan approved in spring 
2016, has identified and verified the need for special waste disposal and treatment capacity, comparing the 
demand with the capacity of existing plants to meet this need or equivalent quantities. With DGR 987/2017 
the same Region then updated the assessment of the needs, that increased especially for the disposal in 
landfills of special hazardous and non-hazardous waste. 
Under Italian regulations, waste is classified on the basis of the place it was generated (home or production 
environment) and not on its physical, chemical or product-related characteristics. 
Legislative Decree 152/2006 classifies waste as municipal or special on the basis of its origin and only 
downstream of this initial classification, according to its level of hazardousness, it is defined as hazardous or 
non-hazardous.  
Municipal waste is household waste (inclusive of bulky waste) produced by homes, waste from cleaning 
streets and other public places, plant waste from green areas and any type of waste dumped or present in 
public areas, including beaches and riverbanks, the production of which cannot be traced to a specific 
source. Also classed as municipal waste is non-hazardous special waste originating in premises and places 
not used for dwelling, that is similar-to-municipal waste in terms of quality and quantity according to the
