Dialogue with our stakeholders 
Hera’s stakeholders 
For an industrial group with the characteristics of Hera, it is essential to take into account the needs and 
demands of all stakeholders which often may not be in agreement. 
A management approach that encourages corporate social responsibility and sustainability entails taking 
into account all legitimate demands of the various categories of stakeholders, balancing these demands 
and integrating them into the company strategies. 
From a survey of corporate stakeholders, a map of corporate stakeholders was defined and the following 
were identified for each category identified: 
•  composition and presence of objectives of particular interest; 
•  topics considered to be a priority; 
•  listening, dialogue and consultation activities carried out during the year. 
Dialogue and consultation initiatives 
Hera(cid:859)s significant commitment to involving stakeholders is by now part of the operational structure of the 
departments that deal with the relations with various stakeholders. 
The continuation of the Local Advisory Boards (HeraLABs) and the start of 2 new HeraLABs in Ravenna and 
Modena according to the new model, the improvement actions after the 2017 climate survey and the 
customer satisfaction surveys on all types of customers, are actions and projects that have led to a solid, 
preferential communication channel with the local community and main stakeholders, and have become 
normal analysis methods that allow us to identify areas for improvement. The results of these activities are 
assessed by Top Management. 
Activities to raise awareness and provide training on the Code of Ethics continued in 2018. 
In the sections of the report, the approach used and the results of the main dialogue and consultation 
initiatives carried out in 2017 are set forth by stakeholder category.
