The Hera Group continues to cooperate with about 80 trade associations who are therefore able to take 
advantage of innovative services and favourable supply conditions.  
In 2018 we consolidated our relationship with Arci at national level and Hera Comm was sponsor of the 
association(cid:859)s National Congress held in Pescara, an important opportunity to highlight the facilitated supply 
conditions we offer to local clubs and their members. 
Concerning  local  initiatives,  this  year  Hera  Comm  was  present  with  a  corner  focused  on  sales  and 
information activities in the summer cinema evening events organized by Arci Reggio Emilia; in addition, 
thanks to the support of Hera Comm and the collaboration with Arci Modena and cinema Raffaello, the 
(cid:862)Cinemamme(cid:863) initiative gave many mothers the opportunity to watch first-window films in a theatre set up 
to accommodate them with their young children. 
The collaboration with the CNA of Parma continued again in 2018, as Hera Comm actively supported the 
association(cid:859)s Sustainability Report presentation event.  
Hera made its support to the local community tangible in Bologna through an agreement with the Social 
Cooperative Piazza Grande, which works in the field of social exclusion, in support of homeless people. 
In Marche, on the other hand, collaboration continued with Ascom Confcommercio of Pesaro and Urbino, 
which created the (cid:862)Itinerari della bellezza(cid:863) project that included the following main initiatives: gastronomic 
weekends, economic agreements with members and a publication that (cid:862)tells the story(cid:863) of the touristic, 
cultural, environmental and gastronomic itinerary that makes its way through Urbino, Sant(cid:859)Angelo in Vado, 
Pergola, Fossombrone and Mondavio. 
These  are  initiatives  to  support  associations  that help  the  most  needy  but  also  measures  aimed  at 
encouraging the economic development of businesses throughout Italy.

Donations are a further opportunity for supporting the area, an action in which Hera Group actively 
supports the weakest social categories. This sensitivity is also extended by the HeraSolidale initiative (see 
the case study in the chapter People). 
In 2018, the Group donated over Euro 329 thousand, 86% of which to its service area. About 55% of 
donations are for cultural and social purposes. 
Also, in 2018, Hera renewed its membership in organizations and associations involved in both disease 
prevention (through scientific research) and patient care. Some examples among many are our support for 
the LILT association which finances research projects in the field of cancer, and for the ASPHI not-for-profit 
organization, which in Bologna, through new technologies, promotes the integration of disabled people in 
schools, work and society, as well as other Emilia-Romagna organizations that continue to implement 
worthy projects such as the Association (cid:862)Insieme a te(cid:863) (Together with you), which has created services and 
aids for free access on a beach at Punta Marina dedicated to seriously disabled people.
