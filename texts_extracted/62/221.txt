Bill of a residential customer with an annual consumption of 1,200 m3 of gas and with direct debit and electronic 
billing. A customer of the market with the highest protection was considered; based on the economic conditions set 
by the Regulatory Authorities: 40% of Hera(cid:859)s residential customers are in this category. Cities considered: Bologna, 
Ferrara, Forl√¨, Imola, Modena, Padua, Pesaro, Ravenna and Trieste (weighted average of inhabitants). The grey areas 
show tariff components that are not attributable to Hera. The complete data on gas supply tariffs are available on the 
Group(cid:859)s website. 
For the same consumption, on average the 2018 gas bill of a Hera residential customer under market tariff 
protection conditions costs about Euro 55 more (+6%) than the previous year. The share of sales of raw 
materials increased by about Euro 42 as a result of the increase in gas prices during the year while the retail 
component remained substantially in line compared to the previous year (up Euro 0.4 due to the change in 
the variable sales quota). The distribution tariff increased by about Euro 3 and system charges remained 
substantially unchanged (up Euro 0.3). Consumption tax and the regional tax are unchanged, while VAT 
increased by Euro 9.5 as a result of the above variations. 
Gas distribution tariffs are set annually by ARERA. Resolution 367/2014/R/GAS of July 2014 defined the 
regulation of the gas distribution and metering service tariffs for the 2014-2019 regulatory period. Tariffs 
are different for each of the country(cid:859)s six macro-regional areas, and are determined so as to ensure 
coverage at the macro-area level of the cost of capital and operating costs incurred by the distributors. The
