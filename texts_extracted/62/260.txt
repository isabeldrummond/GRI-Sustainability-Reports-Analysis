Working in the Hera Group means being able to access a wide range of professional opportunities; the 
variety of our activities allows us to enhance our professional expertise in different sectors and areas. 
In the course of 2018, there were a total of 75 intragroup transfers between different companies or 
business  units,  mainly  in  the  General  Operations  Department,  Herambiente  and  the  Central  Market 
Department. Since 2008, the corporate intranet has included a section dedicated to internal mobility, so 
employees can view announcements for open positions within the Group and apply for those positions, 
allowing them to be actively involved in their growth process and to directly promote their change. Since 
its creation, the dedicated page has received over 1 million visits, and there have been 362 announcements 
published and 204 positions filled; only in 2018, 103,322 visits were posted for the page, and there were 32 
announcements published and 25 positions filled. 
The leadership model 
Since 2011, the Group has been provided with a leadership model: a compass that steers our behaviour 
and describes the skills we need to develop our mission and values and to achieve strategic results. 
In 2016, a shared and participatory process was launched involving over 700 employees, to review the 
model as a result of the new challenges. The new model has inherited exemplary leadership from its 
predecessor, in terms of style, and has included agility as its approach. It follows two lines, a temporal 
today-tomorrow line and another line involving I-us, thus defining 4 areas of objectives each containing 2 
skills. 
The process for getting to know and disseminating the new contents of the model continued in 2018. The 
process involved more than 600 people including managers and middle managers for about 4,000 training 
hours. Multimedia contents (articles, videos, e-learning courses, slides, tests) were made available to the 
entire workforce (over 5,000 employees, middle managers and managers) through the specific e-learning 
platform. Of particular note are the leadership development initiatives which continued in line with the UN 
Agenda  targets:  in  2018,  classroom  activities  led to  the  creation of  the  (cid:862)Casette  del  sorriso(cid:863):  small 
cardboard buildings designed and decorated directly by employees and donated to the paediatric wards of 
hospitals in the areas in which the Group operates. 
Hera, therefore, continued to promote the knowledge and daily implementation by all employees of the 
conduct defined in the model. 
Other development initiatives 
In a context that requires agility, interconnection, speed and ability to achieve innovation both at the 
system level and at the individual level, the 2018 also saw the launch of the Virtual Factory project, multi-
