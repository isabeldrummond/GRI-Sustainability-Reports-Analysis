In 2018, Hera S.p.A. presented the GSE with 10 new initiatives for energy efficiency metered baseline 
projects, in accordance with the provisions of the new Decree of 11 January 2017. The initiatives detailed in 
the applications presented are mainly to be implemented in the Group(cid:859)s service area. 
Among  the  energy  efficiency  improvement  measures  presented  as  part  of  the  White  Certificates 
mechanism and relating to Hera Group(cid:859)s plants, the initiatives to improve the efficiency of Acanthoâ€™s 
natural gas distribution networks and UPS systems are noteworthy.  
In particular, it should be noted that Hera has also pursued energy efficiency by working not only on 
hardware measures, but also on the so-called (cid:862)behavioural measures(cid:863), i.e. by promoting the diffusion of 
conscious and virtuous attitudes towards energy consumption. Five out of ten initiatives submitted to the 
GSE in 2018 concern this field of activity. 
Hera(cid:859)s measures to increase energy efficiency continue both inside and outside the Group, on the one 
hand, by implementing and improving the ISO 50001 certified Energy Management System and, on the 
other, by taking part in events and conferences that address the industrial sector. Among these is the 
company(cid:859)s participation in the (cid:862)Industrial efficiency 2018(cid:863) event in Berlin, where Hera contributed to the 
debate on financial barriers to the implementation of energy efficiency initiatives. In 2018, Hera was also 
invited to the Sustainable Energy Development Agency (SEDA) in Sofia, Bulgaria, to bring its expertise in 
energy efficiency. 
To  confirm  the  Group(cid:859)s  commitment  in  this area, since 2015  Hera  has  been  publishing  the  (cid:862)Valore 
all(cid:859)energia(cid:863) ((cid:862)Value to Energy(cid:863)) report, entirely dedicated to energy efficiency and extended in 2015 to 
AcegasApsAmga and Marche Multiservizi, and that was submitted for the first time in 2017 to Dnv-Gl for 
third-party auditing. A case study is dedicated to the report in the relevant section of this Sustainability 
Report. 
 
Energy efficiency in public lighting 
Three Hera Group companies - Hera Luce, AcegasApsAmga and Marche Multiservizi - manage around 534 
thousand light points (+3% compared 2017), guaranteeing the proper operation of the public lighting 
service in 176 municipalities in ten Regions: Emilia-Romagna, Umbria, Lombardy, Marche, Lazio, Tuscany, 
Piedmont, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Abruzzo. It also manages traffic light installations in some areas 
for a total of over 10,500 traffic lights. 
In 15% of light points operated LED lamps are now used, up compared to 2017. Consumption optimization 
systems (reduction of brightness, partial switching off, etc.) are used at 51% of the light points operated by 
Hera Luce. Energy saving light bulbs (i.e. not mercury-vapour lamps which, according to the energy 
qualification system developed by Hera Luce on the basis of the Minimum Environmental Criteria, belong to 
class G) are used at 35% of the light points served. 
During 2018, Hera Luce(cid:859)s commercial effort aimed at consolidating the territory it serves and expanding its 
area of influence, offering potential customers smart solutions for their respective cities. Among these
