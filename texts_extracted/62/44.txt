amounted to around 11 million tonnes, a value about ten times higher than that of the Group(cid:859)s total direct 
and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2). The highest values are related to the sale of electricity and gas (9.8 
million tonnes) to customers. The share of emissions related to non renewable electricity sold to customers 
decrease compared to 2017 as a result of the increase of the purchase of renewable energy, as indicated in 
the next paragraph.

Considering the emissions avoided by producing energy from renewable sources, energy saving initiatives, 
district heating, separate waste collection and sales to customers of electricity produced from renewable 
sources, total greenhouse gas emissions avoided in 2018 amounted to 2.3 million tonnes. Comparing this 
value to the number of inhabitants served by the Group, 528 kg of greenhouse gases per person were 
avoided by Hera(cid:859)s activities. 
The greenhouse gas emissions avoided through the sale of renewable electricity can be broken in three 
components: 
•  electricity from renewable sources sold for customers with (cid:862)Nature Pa(cid:272)kage(cid:863) a(cid:374)d pur(cid:272)hased for 
Group companies consumptions, doubled from the previous year thanks to: (i) the purchase of 
renewable energy for all the operating activities of Marche Multiservizi and AcegasApsAmga, which 
are added to Hera Spa, which already used renewable energy from 2017; (ii) the increase in 
customers with "Nature Package"; 
•  the electricity from renewable sources that the Group has chosen to purchase also for 2018 
consumption of all free market household customers without "Nature Package". The choice was 
made in March 2019, taking into account the availability of renewable electricity and the prices 
recorded on the market; 
•  the electricity purchased on the market, which includes a component from renewable sources, 
assessed on  the  basis of  the  composition of  the complementary  national energy  mix, which 
decreases from 17% to 2.7% in 2017, as better detailed in the paragraph following. To calculate this 
quota, the last available data are used, which refers to the year preceding the one to which the 
sustainability report refers.
