visits enable visitors to understand how they properly handle waste in the most environmentally-friendly 
manner possible, using solutions with the lowest possible overall impact on the environment.  
In addition to offering (cid:862)traditional(cid:863) guided tours (on site) and to stimulate greater interest among the (cid:862)new 
generations(cid:863), we have implemented (cid:862)virtual(cid:863) tours with schools. By doing so, directly from their school 
desks, students can listen to an environmental educator that illustrates the various phases of operation of 
the plant. 
In total, in 2018, 4,546 visitors (+15% compared to 2017) visited Herambiente Group(cid:859)s facilities over 205 
days. In addition, 368 students visited our facilities through (cid:862)virtual(cid:863) visits. Over a video call, they attended 
a visit from their (cid:862)school desks(cid:863) as an environmental educator illustrated the different phases of operation 
of the plant. This new method promotes the use of multimedia technologies for learning to stimulate 
curiosity and involvement in the pupils while reducing the environmental and organizational impacts due 
to the transfer from the school to the plant to be visited. 
Furthermore, the possibility of booking visits online directly from Herambiente(cid:859)s website, in order to make 
it easier for stakeholders to book visits to our facilities, was met with a positive response. In 2018 the 
possibility of booking visits online was extended to the waste-to-energy plants in Padua, Trieste and 
Pozzilli (IS). The number of installations for which it is possible to book a visit online has therefore risen, 
with the 3 new entries, to 26.
