Bill of a residential customer (family of three) with a yearly consumption of 130 m3. Cities considered: Bologna, 
Ferrara, Forlì, Imola, Modena, Padua, Pesaro, Ravenna, Rimini and Trieste (weighted average of inhabitants). The grey 
areas show tariff components that are not attributable to Hera. 
The average bill of a residential customer with consumption of 130 m3 per year went from Euro 282.89 in 
2017 to Euro 278.24 in 2018: the decrease was 1.6% in the last year as a result of the application of the 
tariff adjustments of previous years that have resulted in some territories, particularly in that of Bologna, 
Imola, Forlì-Cesena and Modena, a decrease in the bill compared to last year.  
Since 2012, ARERA has been responsible for the regulation of the water service. It first of all set up a 
provisional tariff method for the 2012-2013 period and subsequently a permanent tariff method for 2014-
2015, later updated for 2016-2019. The 2018 tariffs have been approved by ARERA for each area it serves. 
The tariffs approved in the various years also include the balances from previous years, determined in 
compliance with the rules of the tariff method. 
Average expenditure for the integrated water service varies among the areas Hera serves since it depends 
on the specific structure of the water supply sources of the various areas, due to the availability of water 
resources and to the distance from the withdrawal source. 
The  tariff  mechanisms  developed  by  ARERA  since  2012  helped  us  continue  to  make  considerable 
investments, particularly for those sectors with a higher environmental impact, such as reclamation from 
sewage-purification. 
In 2017, the portion of the tariff allocated to cover the investments made and to repay capital invested was 
28% of the tariff, while the remaining 72% went to cover operating, maintenance and emergency costs for 
grids and plants and the fees paid to municipalities and asset companies for the use of infrastructures. 
How much water costs 
As well as benefiting the environment, drinking tap water instead of mineral water also saves money: 
considering an average yearly consumption 1,000 litres for a household of three people and an average 
price in Italy of Euro 27 cents per litre for certain retailed mineral waters, yearly spending on mineral water 
comes to around Euro 270 a year. The cost for the same quantity of aqueduct water, meanwhile, would be 
Euro 2.14 a year (calculated as the 2018 average of the bills in the nine main cities served by Hera). Italy is 
third in the world for consumption of bottled water with 184 litres of water consumed per capita in 2017, 
after Mexico and Thailand (Source: Statista The Statistics Portal 2017). 
The cost of water in Europe 
In 2017, the International Water Association carried out research on the drinking water charges applied in 
452 cities in 147 countries. In the 93 European cities, the cost of annual consumption of 180 m3/year ranges 
from a minimum of Euro 0.78 to a maximum of Euro 7.07 per m3. Italy has the lowest cost with Milan, and 
among the lowest costs with Naples, Rome, Venice, Palermo and Genoa.
