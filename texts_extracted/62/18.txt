from a ten-year long integration of prospective sustainability within the Group(cid:859)s strategy, may already 
report a significant portion of shared value expressed through services, activities geared towards the local 
area and industrial projects. The valuation with regard to the EBITDA reported for the year is the portion of 
industrial  income  directly  attributable  to  the  Group(cid:859)s  activities,  related  to  the  total  economic  value 
distributed to stakeholders throughout the areas, and detailed in the relevant section in this Report. 
(cid:862)Shared value(cid:863) EBITDA 
The Hera Group continues to report (cid:862)shared value(cid:863) EBITDA (started for the first time with the 2016 
sustainability report), i.e. the portion of EBITDA resulting from projects and activities that respond to the 
(cid:862)calls to action(cid:863) classified in the three CSV Drivers: in 2018, this value totalled Euro 375.2 million (equal to 
36% of the total), a 14% increase compared to the previous year. This result is in line with the 2018-22 
Business Plan, created so that approximately 40% of 2022 EBITDA will derive from business activities that 
respond to the priorities of the global sustainability agenda.  
A roughly 14% increase in (cid:862)shared value(cid:863) EBITDA is recorded against a 5% increase in the Group(cid:859)s overall 
EBITDA (equal to Euro 1,031 million) compared to the previous year.  
The prevailing contribution derives from activities and projects related to the efficient use of resources 
(Euro  260.6  million),  followed  by  those  related  to  innovation  and  contribution  to  development 
(approximately Euro 78.2 million). The smart use of energy accounts for Euro 66.9 million in 2018.

As pointed out in the diagram, around 70% of (cid:862)shared value(cid:863) EBITDA generated in 2018 is mainly the result 
of activities and projects that meet the (cid:862)calls to action(cid:863) of the 2030 UN Global Agenda for an (cid:862)efficient use 
of resources(cid:863). As regards (cid:862)Impact Area(cid:863), the key role played by the Group in creating value with activities 
related  to  the  transition  to  a  circular  economy  (+28%  compared  to  2017)  and  to  the  sustainable 
management of water resources (+8% compared to 2017) emerges. 
Around 17% of (cid:862)shared value(cid:863) EBITDA was instead generated from activities belonging to the Global 
Agenda areas that lead towards a (cid:862)smart use of energy(cid:863). 70% of this share of EBITDA comes from 
initiatives aimed at the promotion of energy efficiency, through the development of commercial offers to 
Group customers and the reduction of internal energy consumption, with particular attention to water
