video tutorials to provide more in-depth analysis of trends and digital tools, a digital skills development 
course customized on the basis of the outcome of the digital profile found during the survey phase.  
In addition, the Digital & Analytics for Managers project was implemented with the development of a 
special ad hoc platform, two (cid:862)digital lab(cid:863) action learning projects aimed at developing innovative ideas in 
digital innovation were implemented and an envisioning initiative for management was implemented. 
 
Sustainability among the (cid:862)new skills(cid:863) of young people: Hera Groupâ€™s contribution 
Environmental education 
For years the Hera Group has been promoting many environmental education projects, in all the areas, in 
order to raise awareness in schools on issues related to services and to take part in the disclosure 
processes, making available a variety of company skills.  
The (cid:862)La Grande Macchina del Mondo(cid:863) ((cid:862)The Great Engine of the World(cid:863)) project closed the 2017-2018 
school year with results that attest to a significant success, confirming how the school world, from 
kindergartens to secondary schools, is in the free educational programme that Hera offers throughout the 
area it serves.  
The results of the latest school year were very positive both for the number of students admitted and for 
the requests met. In Emilia-Romagna, the part of the project dedicated to the groups from 4 to 13 years of 
age has seen an ever-increasing participation. The new laboratories have been very popular and the new 
features introduced, both at a methodological and narrative level, have met with the approval of the 
teachers. Particular attention was paid to the schools of Ferrara, a city in which quantity-based tariff (TCP) 
was introduced, to ensure that students were aware of the subject and that they spread their knowledge 
and awareness among their families. 
 
The didactic part reserved for high schools involved more than 21,000 students, about 1,000 more than the 
previous  school  year,  proving  that  the  topics  proposed  continue  to  be  of  great  interest  and  highly 
innovative for schools.  
 
For the 2018-2019 school year, the projects will focus mainly on the (cid:862)ecological mind(cid:863) topic, especially with 
reference to the environmental issues of our core business: scarcity of resources, biodiversity and the 
reduction of polluting sources, with a view to integrate the different disciplines for a more circular and 
sustainable model of society.

In line with Hera Group(cid:859)s guidelines, the intense activity of free educational proposals to schools continued 
throughout the territory served by AcegasApsAmga under the (cid:862)The Great Engine of the World(cid:863) and (cid:862)Un 
pozzo di scienza(cid:863) ((cid:862)Science Well(cid:863)) programmes. The number of schools involved has slightly decreased (251
