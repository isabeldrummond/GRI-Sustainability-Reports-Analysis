•  declaration of full knowledge of the SA 8000 standard and Hera(cid:859)s Social responsibility policy, and of 
commitment to comply with the principles and requirements included in the same and with the 
participation  in monitoring  and  audit  activities envisaged  by  the  Hera Group,  as  well  as  the 
assessment of any corrective measures required; 
•  possession of the following system certifications: ISO 9001; ISO 14001; OHSAS 18001; SA 8000; ISO 
50001; 
•  possession of the certificate of enrolment in the National register of environmental operators, 
pertinent to the precise activities of the commodity group; 
•  possession of enrolment with current validity, care of the pertinent Prefecture for the sectors of 
interest identified by the Prime Minister(cid:859)s Decree dated 18 April 2013, in the list of the suppliers 
not subject to mafia infiltration attempts (so-called white list), otherwise presentation of a formal 
commitment to request the same. 
Furthermore, for the purpose of ensuring the business operations and only in exceptional cases, the Group 
foresees the possibility of making exceptions, in the following cases: 
•  casual suppliers: in the event of needs motivated by reasons of experimentation, it is possible to 
issue just one purchase document vis-à-vis an uncertified supplier. These (cid:862)casual(cid:863) suppliers, in 
order  to  be  able  to  receive  additional  purchase  orders,  will  have  to  obtain  qualification  in 
observance of the Hera Group; 
•  exclusive suppliers: in the event of indispensable needs, it is possible to issue purchase documents 
vis-à-vis a qualified supplier, on an exclusive basis; 
•  procedure for purchases using order vouchers: purchase of goods on a case by case basis for a 
modest  economic  value,  issuing  order  vouchers  on  suppliers  with  which  there  are  specific 
agreements or even lacking specific agreement; 
•  procedure for other purchases which, having considered their nature (for example: legal, notarial, 
courier or translations costs) do not require the prior qualification of the suppliers. Otherwise the 
purchase must be appropriately registered in accordance with the rules established by the Group. 
 
Suppliers: breakdown by type of certification 
The portion of purchases from SA 8000, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certified suppliers reported an 
increase with respect to 2017, while the volume purchased from ISO 9001 certified suppliers was stable 
with respect to the previous years. This result is the consequence of both direct action taken by the Group 
companies, which systematically include indication of the possession of certification in the calls for tenders 
or in the supplier qualification stage as a requirement for participation and/or incentive for the tender, and 
of the greater sensitivity acquired by the companies in considering the certification as a component of 
greater competitiveness. 
Procurement from suppliers - value breakdown by type of certification (% of total supplies) 
%  2016  2017  2018 
Quality certification (ISO 9001)  87.1%  88.9%  87.4% 
Environmental certification (ISO 14001- 58.0%  60.6%  65.7% 
Emas) 
Occupational safety (OHSAS 18001)  49.5%  51.8%  56.8% 
Social certification (SA 8000)  25.8%  24.1%  33.2% 
Total supplies (in millions of Euro)  815.7  888.6  911.8 
 
The value of the tenders awarded to certified suppliers is always greater than the percentage of suppliers 
present in the register and in possession of certification. Again this result is the consequence of the 
systematic request for possession of certification in the supplier qualification and selection stage.
