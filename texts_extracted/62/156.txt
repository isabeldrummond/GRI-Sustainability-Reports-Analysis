Hera for electric transportation 
In September 2018 the Hera Group, through Hera Comm, and other operators in the sector, signed a 
memorandum of understanding with the Emilia-Romagna Regional Government to expand the public 
regional network for recharging electric vehicles. The operators have jointly committed to increasing the 
number of charging stations to 1,500 by 2020. 
This agreement updates the previous memorandum of understanding of 2011 in the light of the regulatory 
changes that have occurred in the meantime, which have opened up the management of the charging 
service to parties outside the energy world. With this in mind, the Hera Group has decided to handle all its 
electric mobility activities through the Hera Comm sales company, which, starting in 2019, will also be 
responsible for managing the charging infrastructure. 
In 2018, demand for the recharging service continued to grow, both in terms of use of the Group(cid:859)s 
infrastructure and growth in the number of commercial contracts. The Group(cid:859)s network of charging 
stations, currently about 50 (35 of which are public and 15 private) located in the provinces of Trieste, 
Gorizia, Udine, Modena and Bologna, recorded consumption of about 60,000 kWh (+12% compared to 
2017). Recharging contracts, which are now 140 (+52 compared to 2017), provided a total of 11,000 
recharges (+45% compared to 2017), equal to a consumption of more than 110,000 kWh and an estimated 
(cid:271)e(cid:374)efit for the e(cid:374)(cid:448)iro(cid:374)(cid:373)e(cid:374)t of 9(cid:1004) t of CO₂ a(cid:448)oided. 
 
Hera for land protection 
Land reuse in Group projects and re-use of excavated earth 
In 2018, the network and plant works we completed used almost 170,000 m2 of land, 68% of which was 
already occupied by existing infrastructure. The Integrated Water Service, which recovered more than 
95,000 m2 of soil, is the most significant contribution, in relation to the number of interventions carried 
out in the period under review. 
From the preliminary analyses to the design of works, the Hera Group identifies technical solutions aimed 
at reusing areas that have already been urbanized and/or preserving the natural context of the land subject 
to intervention, in line with the objectives of the UN(cid:859)s 2030 Agenda. 
The following are among the main design criteria: 
•  in the network area: extensions carried out using existing roads and/or urban fabric, improvement 
of the network layout by upgrading or reclaiming of existing pipelines, laying of new pipelines 
adjacent to existing services; 
•  in the plant area: reuse of existing/occupied areas and infrastructures; disposal of infrastructure 
and restoration/return of the area at the end of its life cycle, use of technological solutions to 
reduce the overall size of the infrastructure. 
During 2018 we completed many projects that involved a significant recovery of soil, among those in the 
field of purification are certainly noteworthy. These include the upgrade of the Cesena purification plant 
(20,000 m2), the construction of the head tank of the Riccione purification plant (14,000 m2) and the 
recovery of the via dell(cid:859)Ambiente plant in Ozzano dell(cid:859)Emilia (BO) (5,000 m2).  
In the 2019-2022 period we plan to reuse almost 700,000 m2 of land in the design of infrastructure, or 3/4 
of the total land involved in new projects. 
Biodiversity 
As regards the protection and conservation of habitats and wild species, the EU issued two regulations, 
Council Directive 409/79, adopted in April 1979, on the conservation of wild birds (the (cid:862)Birds Directive(cid:863)) 
and Council Directive 43/92, adopted in May 1992, on the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora
