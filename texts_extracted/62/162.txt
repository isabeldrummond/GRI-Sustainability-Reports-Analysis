The fund(cid:859)s balance at 31 December 2018 is negative, at about Euro -1,340 thousand, (including interest 
income for previous fiscal years). The balance, relating to 2018 alone, is negative by Euro 1,801 thousand. 
During 2018, the effect of the increase in the number of leaks downstream of meters, which became 
significant from the summer of 2017, continued and affected the entire current year. This led to a 
significant reduction in the fund, which for the first time since its creation, entered into negative area. In 
view of this situation, and taking into account that the fund regulations allow updating the membership 
fees after verification of its size, during 2018 we examined options to reduce the balance of the fund 
following the significant increase in the number of redemption requests. As of 1 January 2019, a new 
method for charging the membership fee was implemented, which will consist of a fixed fee of Euro 10 per 
year per contract and a variable fee of Euro 5 per year per property unit served.  
Since the fund is exclusively designed to benefit its participating customers, and since the monthly balances 
were almost negative in 2018, no interest was calculated. Since its inception, the fund has reimbursed 
around 52 thousand users, 12,146 of which in 2018, for an average reimbursement of Euro 1,433. Less than 
4% of customers is not covered by the (cid:862)Leak fund(cid:863). In 2018, we received just over 1,000 requests for 
withdrawal from the fund. 
Per capita tariff rewards water savings and helps large households 
In its resolution 665/2017 of 28 September 2017 ARERA introduced the per capita tariff for all resident 
domestic users, to be gradually applied in all municipalities starting in 2018 and to be completed by 2022. 
In fact, a transitional period has been set, during which the Water Service Operator, lacking information on 
the actual number of components, can invoice according to a standard criterion (i.e. considering a typical 
three-member resident domestic household user).
