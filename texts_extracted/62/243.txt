For the business call centre the level of service improved compared to the previous year in terms of both 
average waiting times and calls answered.  
In 2018, the contribution of the call centre in the commercial area increased significantly, both in terms of 
the acquisition of new contracts and presenting the campaigns launched during the year that involved 
various areas (proposal of offers, collection of customer data such as: mobile phone number, data privacy 
consent and email). In 2019, the objective is to maintain the trend of gradual growth in the results 
achieved. 
The business call centre continued to innovate its service offering for business customers. Innovations in 
the ways critical cases are handled have improved problem solving, prevented many complaints and 
improved customer relations. 
In the AcegasApsAmga area, close monitoring of services and analysis of the timely Customer Satisfaction 
Index (In Touch) continued throughout 2018 to identify critical areas and correct them with targeted 
training. Corrective measures were therefore applied for critical customers and processes were simplified 
where necessary, and more extensive training sessions were held to explain the bill and the invoicing 
process.
