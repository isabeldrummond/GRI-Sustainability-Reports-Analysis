Figures apply only to Hera Comm 
Hera Commâ€™s online services proved very popular among customers again in 2018: the growth trend of the 
past five years is continuing and this year, 20.7% of our customers had subscribed to the services. In fact, 
the number of subscribers rose by almost 18% compared to last year, reaching about 350 thousand 
customers. The interest of customers in receiving their bills in electronic format continues: 23.7% of 
participating customers have chosen to receive their bills via email, an increase of 25% compared to 2017. 
The growth is also due to the merger of Amga Energia & Servizi Srl into Hera Comm. For customers who 
have not chosen the bill in electronic format, the bills are printed on 100% recycled paper and delivered by 
regular mail. 
There  are  38,856  customers  registered  with  Estenergy(cid:859)s  on-line  services,  while  those  with  Marche

electronic bills are 35,638 for Estenergy (+ 44% compared to 2017) and 3,557 (+56% compared to 2017).

their bills without paper (compared to 7.3% in 2017).
