 
At European level, the trend towards reducing the use of landfills for municipal waste disposal is also 
continuing, although there are significant differences among the countries: in the EU-28 the figure for 2017 
was 24% (Source: Eurostat). In Italy, 26% of municipal waste disposed of in 2017 was sent to landfills 
compared to 21% sent for waste-to-energy treatment, the use of landfills decreased by 2 percentage points 
while use of waste-to-energy treatment increased by 1 percentage point.  
Landfills continue to be the primary treatment method in 13 European countries, with peaks of up to 93% 
in Malta and 80% in Greece. In Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Holland, Germany and Finland, landfill is used 
for around 1% and waste-to-energy ranges from 31% to 53%, with the remainder being sent for recycling. 
Hera is in line with these countries in terms of recycling with further improvements planned for the coming 
years.
