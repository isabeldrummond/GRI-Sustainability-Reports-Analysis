line with the previous standards observed by Hera and with the company(cid:859)s mid- and long-term goals. The 
changes to the regulations did not therefore have any particular impact on Hera or any significant negative 
impact on the continuity of its goals and activities. Specifically, the resolution added more stringent 
requirements on the inspection of networks, on odorizing and on incentives to upgrade the odorising 
systems. 
Since 2010, gas distribution companies have been obliged to participate in a system of incentives for safety 
improvements in the service defined by ARERA, which assesses four aspects: 
•  compliance with service obligations, absence of gas accidents falling under the responsibility of the 
operator, absence of breaches in this area connected with ARERA(cid:859)s controls or inspections; 
•  the number of measurements of the level of gas odorizing compared to the required minimum; 
•  the number of conventional leaks reported by third parties compared to the objective set by 
ARERA for the period; 
•  the number of upgraded odorizing plants (flow-proportional, remote controlled injection-type 
odorizing plants). 
For 2018, the Regulatory Authority has not yet approved the economic values of bonuses and penalties for 
Inrete. The balance between premiums and penalties for the gas distribution service for the provincial 
areas served in Emilia-Romagna is expected to amount to approximately Euro 1.4 million. In particular, 
positive results were obtained both for the component relating to odorization and for the component 
regarding leaks reported by third parties. In 2019 the Italian Regulatory Authority is expected to publish the 
measure that determines these values as well as the results obtained by the distribution companies in 
2017. For AcegasApsAmga, in 2018, incentives for odorization are estimated at Euro 312 thousand, as well 
as incentives for dispersions for Euro 848 thousand, net of the penalties expected mainly for the plants in 
the province of Gorizia. Compared to the previous year, the Trieste plant benefited from the incentives as it 
complied with the obligations set out in point 35.4 of the RQDG (95% upgrading of unprotected steel 
pipelines).

Resolution  ARERA  574/2013  (cid:862)Consolidated  Law  for  the  regulation  of  the  quality  and  rates  of  gas 
distribution  and  metering  services  for  regulatory  period  2014-2019(cid:863)  (TUDG)  establishes  that  the 
distribution company must comply with the minimum annual percentage service obligation of 90% of calls 
with arrival time at the place of call for emergency services within the maximum time of 60 minutes. 
Final data on emergency response activities in 2018 show an increase in calls to toll-free numbers, 
especially for the Bologna (linked to the massive replacement of gas meters) and Ravenna (linked to the 
introduction of a new odorizer that has generated a greater perception of gas odour even for small 
dispersions) areas. Overall, this increase led to a decrease in the percentage of calls with intervention 
within 60 minutes. Despite this, an increase in the number of calls received, the positive levels of the 
security and continuity indicators however confirm that the Group is firmly above the levels set by ARERA: 
compared to the minimum service obligation required by ARERA of 90%, in 2018 the Group intervened 
within 60 minutes for 96.7% of the over 22 thousand calls received. AcegasApsAmga recorded 99.7% for 
this indicator while Marche Multiservizi recorded 96.3%.
