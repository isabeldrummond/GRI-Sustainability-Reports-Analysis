above table. At Hera Group level, in fact, the number of light vehicles powered by low environmental 
impact fuel increased further in 2018: by 3% over 2017. 
Also, in order to reduce consumption and improve safety on the waste collection vehicles, in 2013 Hera 
added the Drive System Tool (DST) device. Fully operational since 2015 on all vehicles, the device uses a 
measurement box to record the driving style of the drivers of side-loading waste collection compactors. 
This measurement allowed consumption to settle at around 1.65 km/l (2018), generating a reduction of 
276 toe between 2017 and 2018. The drop in fuel consumption also reduced environmental impact, given 
the lower amount of CO  released into the atmosphere.

A comparison between the several types of fuel was made considering the primary energy present in the single fuels. 
The consumption of fuel consumed by the vehicles remains stable. Diesel consumption is in line with 2017, 
while  gasoline  and  LPG  consumption  are  up,  by  2.6%  and  2.1%  respectively. Methane  consumption 
decreased by 3.5%. Overall, the consumption of fuels with a reduced environmental impact decreased by 
1%, mainly due to the reduction in kilometers traveled.
