As regards the separate waste collection data on the types of material collected, the details of the 
individual types are set out below, with the most significant changes in 2018 compared to 2017:  
•  the collection of plastic (+19%) and glass (+13%) containers on the total grew further, due to the 
conversion  of  multi-material  collections,  the  subject  of  specific  communication  campaigns  in 
collaboration with the respective Consortia for those types. The data on the per capita quantities in 
Emilia-Romagna are significant in these sectors, with a 27.8% increase for plastics and a 22.3% 
increase for glass;  
•  there  was  growth  in  the  organic  fraction  (+9%),  particularly  in  Emilia-Romagna  and  Marche, 
introduced in some areas with new reorganizations of services. Also in this case, there was a 
notable +16.3% on the per capita data for the Emilia-Romagna area; 
•  collection of bulky waste fell 6%; 
•  the decline in multi-material collections in Emilia-Romagna continued (-12.3% of the total and -
5.8% per capita) due to the reorganisation of the service, since, in accordance with the guidelines 
of the Regional Waste Management Plan, the collection of light multi-material is being phased out. 
This decrease is however compensated by an increase for the Triveneto area, which therefore leads 
to an overall +4%; 
•  the Other item increased as a result of the greater quantities of road sweeping dispatched for 
recovery and the inclusion of the estimate of volumes of waste for domestic composting (as per 
Regional Authority Decision 2218/2016), which in 2017 had not been counted since the Emilia-
Romagna Regional Government had not yet decided on the municipalities admitted.
