For the purpose of calculating the emission intensity, the value relating to the 
total direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions and the indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions 
was used calculated with the Location Based methodology, parameterized to the 
total number of employees, seconded employees and associates present at the 
Cerved Group buildings.

70 Source of factors used to calculate emissions: European Residual Mixes 2018.
71  Calculated by adding direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions and indirect (Scope 2) emissions with Location Based methodology. 
72  The figures for 2017 were caused by extraordinary disposal operations, which include all the activities related to the 
transfer of the headquarters from Milan to San Donato Milanese and the closure of three corporate offices (Brescia, 
Prato and Verona).
