Air emissions
The emissions of CO  deriving from the Maranello and Modena plants and from the Mugello racing circuit 
2eq
(Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based) are equal to 94,615 tCO  in 2019, in line with 91,773 tCO  in 2018,

92,609 tCO  in 2017 and 93,086 tCO  in 2016(6).

GHG Protocol (WRI, WBCSD) definitions
In 2019, our Scope 2 market-based GHG emissions are 826 tons CO . If Ferrari had not purchased 
2eq
Guarantee of Origin certificates these emissions would have been higher by 14,785 tons(10).
As shown in the table below, Ferrari managed to decouple its economic growth from its environmental 
impact. In other words, we continue growing our business activities while at the same time maintaining our 
CO  emissions almost stable. The below carbon ratios are based on the sum of the emissions from scope 1 
2
and scope 2 market-based method.

(6)  Regarding scope 2 emissions, measured in tons of CO,the percentage of methane and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on the total 
2
greenhouse gas emissions (CO equivalent) as indicated in the ISPRA Report “Atmospheric emission factors of CO and other greenhouse 
2 2
gases in the electricity sector”.
(7)  Direct greenhouse gas emissions, measured in tons of CO equivalent, were calculated using emission factors indicated in “Emission Factors 
2
from Cross-Sector Tools; March 2017” and “Global Warming Potential Values Guidance; May 2015”, published by The Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol. Gases included in the calculation of the Scope 1 GHG emissions: CO, CH, NO, HFCs and other refrigerant gases.

(8)  Market-based indirect greenhouse gas emissions, measured in tons of CO, were calculated using the Residual Mix emission factors indicated 
2
in “2018 European Residual Mixes, V.1.2”, published by AIB. The Group purchases Guarantee of Origin (GO) certificates in order to reduce 
the impact of CO emissions in the atmosphere. The 2016 and 2017 data have been re-calculated using the same emission factors used for 
2
2018 data.
(9)  Location-based indirect greenhouse gas emissions, measured in tons of CO, were calculated using the emission factor indicated in 
2
“Confronti internazionali; 2017”, published by Terna. The 2016 and 2017 data have been re-calculated using the same emission factors used 
for 2018 data.
(10)  Calculated using the market-based method and considering an alternative scenario in which Ferrari does not purchase Guarantee of Origin 
certificates for electricity.
