Other significant air emissions are related mainly to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released during 
vehicle manufacturing. In addition, NO , SO  and dust emissions are constantly monitored.

Furthermore, a water-based painting process was introduced in 2004 with the aim of reducing VOC 
emissions.
Waste management
We acknowledge that rational use of raw materials, together with careful waste management, helps reduce 
the environmental impact of the manufacturing process. In addition, innovative solutions and advanced 
technical processes minimize waste and negative environmental impact. The reuse of production scraps in 
our manufacturing process also has the objective of reducing waste. 
To achieve this target, a series of initiatives in the different phases of the manufacturing process have been 
implemented. As an example, aluminum scraps are melted in the foundry to avoid waste: this is particularly 
important considering that aluminum is the first raw material (by weight) used in our manufacturing 
process. Other projects aimed at reducing waste are undergoing a feasibility analysis. In particular, 
according to the concept of the circular economy, in some cases our production scraps can be used by 
other business partners in their manufacturing process (e.g. leather scraps, processed sand used in the 
foundry, aluminum that cannot be smelted).

(11)  Only air emissions of the plants of Maranello and Modena have been considered. The 2018 data referring to Dusts has been restated to 
include Modena plant.
(12)  Data includes only waste generated by Ferrari S.p.A. in the plants of Maranello and Modena and third-party warehouses: waste of Mugello 
racing circuit has an impact of less than 2% of the total waste produced by the Group.
(13)  For a better reporting of the total waste generated by the Group, waste generated by Ferrari S.p.A. and managed through third-party 
warehouses, not included in the previous Report, have been added to 2018 data.
