In May 2019, the concentration of CO in the atmosphere reached 415 parts per million (ppm), with a 
2
steep increase from the pre-industrial levels(2). The link between higher concentration of greenhouse gasses 
in the atmosphere and rising temperatures is widely supported by scientific evidence, as highlighted by 
the report published by IPCC in 2018(3). The new European Commission has recently laid out a plan to 
make Europe the world’s first climate neutral continent by 2050. Energy production and use account for 
more than 75% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy constitutes 30% of energy 
production(4). Transition to carbon neutrality will also be achieved through the strengthening of the circular 
economy. Currently, the European industry uses only 12% of recycled materials(5).
