CAPEX Captalised R&D
In 2017, according to OECD data, the gross domestic spending on R&D was 1.35% of the GDP in Italy, 
1.97% in European Union and 2.79% in the USA(1). The automotive sector is the EU’s number one 
investor in R&D and is responsible for 28% of total spending, with €57.4 billion annually(2). Increasing 
amounts of R&D are being directed at developing electric vehicles and autonomous driving, while 
other funds are deployed to improve vehicle safety. On this last issue, the European Union has set a 
target to reach zero deaths and serious injuries by 2050(3).
