All the employees of the Group in Italy (representing 94.4% of our total workforce) are subject to collective 
agreements (CCSL, Contratto Collettivo Specifico di Lavoro and Accordo Premio di Competitività Ferrari). 
Ferrari pays salaries that are in line with industry standards. In addition to the statutory minimum wages, 
salaries are often determined by collective bargaining agreements. 
All the individual notice periods are provided by the CCSL signed on March 11, 2019, referring to employees 
category and business seniority. The minimum notice period is fixed to 10 days.
