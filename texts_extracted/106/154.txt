DRUMS MADE OF WOOD AND OTHER MATERIALS
For the transport of cables, Prysmian uses plastic drums for the smallest diameters, in wood up to 3 meters and 
in steel for larger diameters. In general, the choice of drum material is made based on the size and length of 
the cable, on criteria of optimisation of logistics flows with a view to reducing the Carbon Footprint, and also 
on the basis of specific requests formulated by the customer and/or linked to regulatory aspects specific to the 
destination country.
The Group is heavily committed to maximising the re-utilisation of drums and lowering their environmental 
impact. For example, this involves using wood from replanted forests and implementing lagging solutions that 
reduce the recourse made to quality materials, while continuing to use recyclable materials. This commitment 
over the years has helped to improve the re-use rate of drums, as a consequence of management that is increa-
singly precise and environmentally aware.

Furthermore, in order to reduce the consumption of drums, in 2019 the Group entered into agreements in va-
rious countries to guarantee a flow of “Reverse Logistics” in which the return of the drums is assured. For exam-
ple, Prysmian allows plants to use the German KTG system (KabelTrommel GmbH) in the Czech Republic and 
Hungary. This envisages the rental of drums to cable producers, thus minimising the handling (and abandon-
ment) of drums from Germany.
In 2019, as part of work to consolidate and integrate the former General Cable manufacturing plants into the 
global supply chain, the Prysmian Group consolidated intercompany flows at regional level, thus reducing inter-
continental flows in the Power Cables area.
48 The calculation of percentages of transport routes is carried out on the basis of expenditure and it refers to Prysmian before the merger with General Cable.
49  The data refers to all former General Cable plants (pre-merger with Prysmian Group), excluding the plants in Morelena (Portugal) owned by General Cable Celcat, 
Energia e Telecomunicaçoes SA and the plant in Montereau (France) owned by Silec Cable S.A.S.
