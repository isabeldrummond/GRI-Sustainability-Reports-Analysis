who work for us and our community, providing continuous, multi-disciplinary and 
specialist training to our employees, many of whom - about 9,200 out of almost 
29,000 - are also long-term shareholders. Management and employees own about 
1.5% of the share capital of Prysmian Group, investing directly in the Company and

MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE SCHEMES
Furthermore, we have adopted a management incentive scheme linked to the 
achievement of objectives for the improvement of our ESG parameters that applies 
to all Prysmian Group managers. Group performance in relation to these criteria du-
ring 2019 is assessed by the Compensation, Appointments and Sustainability Com-
mittee, with reference to a series of parameters that evidence the progress made by 
the action plans implemented. These reference the parameters defined by the prin-
cipal sustainability indexes to which we belong - Dow Jones Sustainability Index, 
CDP Index, EcoVadis index - for the level of gender diversity within management, 
the reduction of CO emissions and topics relating to occupational health and safety.
