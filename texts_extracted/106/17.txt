16 Prysmian Group    Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019
A business model balanced
by segment and geographical area  
The diversified portfolio of activities is a strength for the Prysmian 
Group, as the only global leader with a business model balanced 
among areas with differing profiles, where each segment plays a pre-
cise role in the overall strategy, considering stability, growth potential 
and the generation of opportunities.
Historically, the Energy area has delivered the most stable results, while the Projects and Telecom areas have 
been marked by greater volatility.
Acquisitions have always fit in with the strategy of maintaining balance: General Cable enabled the Group to 
diversify geographically, with strong exposure to the North American market, which is structured differently 
with more consolidated dynamics. 
Additionally, while the positioning of the Prysmian Group as a cable manufacturer remains central, part of its 
activities make it a network solution provider, drawing on the ability to integrate ever more closely the various 
components - engineering, installation, network monitoring and after-sales services - in order to provide va-
lue-added services that ensure recurring revenue streams and build long-term partnerships with customers.
Alongside this, the Group is also able to identify and develop value-added market niches - such as elevator 
cables, cables for multimedia applications, solutions produced by Prysmian Electronics - while releasing the sy-
nergies needed to be cost-effective and offer end-to-end solutions integrated with advanced digital equipment.
