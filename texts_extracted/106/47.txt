R&D BY THE PRYSMIAN GROUP: THE FOCUS
Core areas
The main aspect guiding the strategy of the Prysmian Group is the need to concentrate on factors that facilitate 
the development of cabled infrastructures for the transportation of electricity and information that, today, are 
essential elements in all current transformations of society, from the new electric mobility to smart cities, from 
the expansion of 5G to the use of artificial intelligence to collect and interpret data, and much more.
The ever more advanced search for EHV electricity transmission systems that can be buried, for longer and more 
efficient cables that can be laid at greater depth, for optical fibre solutions that can contain the largest number 
of cables in a miniaturised space and that can be used easily in the field, are therefore core areas in which the 
majority of the investment made by the Group is dedicated.
