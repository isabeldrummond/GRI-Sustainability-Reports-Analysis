Prysmian Group    Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 21
As an industry leader, we seek to make a stable contribution to the modernisation of the entire sector and 
to improve Group processes constantly, in a proactive manner, in order to make them more efficient and 
sustainable. We achieve this by collaborating with international research centres and universities, with our 
suppliers throughout the entire production chain and with our customers, with which we have developed 
long-term co-innovation processes and partnerships.
The Prysmian Group is committed to making constant innovations that enhance the performance of terrestrial 
and submarine HV cables, which are key to the development of power grids.  
Cable technology in support of the energy transition
Cables (especially HV terrestrial and submarine cables) are and will be an essential component in com-
pleting the energy transition, as they are responsible for the generation of electricity by offshore wind 
farms and for the interconnections between systems and countries, thus supporting the implementa-
tion of more integrated, efficient and sustainable electricity grids.
More specifically:
cables represent the backbone of electricity grids, the components without which it would not be 
possible to transmit and transport energy from one country to another;
cables (especially terrestrial and submarine cables) make the entire electricity grid more efficient, 
facilitating the exchange of energy between different countries / consumption areas with different 
consumption models, thus enabling consumers to obtain access to cheaper and cleaner energy;
submarine cables transmit electricity from the sea, where the wind farms are located, to the land, 
where the primary distribution network is located;
terrestrial cables transmit electricity from the areas in which it is generated (the landfall of submarine 
cables) to the places in which it is consumed.
Prysmian roadmap for innovation 
In particular, research efforts are focused on a number of main objectives: 
cables that can be installed at ever greater depths and in any marine environment, even reaching a 
depth of 3,000 metres;
ever longer interconnections, to link countries that are far apart;
cables for the wind farms furthest from land (e.g. floating wind farms), located in the most wind-
swept areas;
increase the intrinsic reliability of cables, limiting their dispersion, and equipping them with sensors 
capable of monitoring the system;
increase cable productivity, contributing to a significant reduction in system installation costs. In par-
ticular, more productive and reliable cables help to optimise installation costs (fewer trenches and 
therefore easier access to the permits needed to complete an interconnection).
In the same way, the objective in the optical fibre sector is to ensure ever greater levels of flexibility, 
without loss of signal quality, and to prepare for the 5G challenge that will require the market to install 
new infrastructure to an almost unprecedented extent.
