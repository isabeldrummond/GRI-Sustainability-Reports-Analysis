Cyber Security
In a rapidly changing world where information is increasingly significant and there is a growing connection 
between networks, systems and applications, it is increasingly complex to manage and protect information 
resources, ensuring regulatory compliance. This increased complexity - combined with the growth and evolu-
tion of cyber threats - exposes companies to new types of risk, the damaging effects of which can have serious 
economic, legal, reputational, compliance or competitive advantage repercussions, due to information loss or 
business interruption.
This complexity concerns the Group not only as a user, but also as a service provider, being systematically in-
volved in innovation to compete in the global market, through the adoption of new technologies to ensure the 
centrality of the customer and increase business efficiency.
In this context, in 2017 the Prysmian Group developed an Information Security Strategy, whose main objective is 
to tackle effectively the management, control and protection of the Group’s information assets.
The Group’s Information and IT Security organisation comprises a Cyber Security Unit directly that reports di-
rectly to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who is part of the HQ HR staff.
The unit is structured to manage four main skills:
  Governance, to ensure that the Organisation has effective control structures to maintain and improve levels 
of prevention, investigation, response and restoration of security in the event of an incident;
  Prevention, to reduce the practical exposure to cyber attacks via systematic analyses and work to protect the 
Group’s assets;
  Detection, to ensure that the organisation is aware of internal and external threats and can mitigate them 
proactively;
  Response & Recovery, to defend the organisation against cyber attacks and restore operational functionality 
in case of impact.
The organisational structure envisages the involvement of Business Lines in IT security activities via the Infor-
mation Security Committee, chaired by the Head of Industrial Relations (CSO) and permanently composed of 
the Chief Information Officer (CIO), the Audit & Compliance Manager, the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Ope-
rating Officer (COO) and the Senior VP HR & Organization.
The Group has issued a complete series of policies, procedures and operating instructions, with the aim of di-
recting and regulating, at different levels of detail, information security issues and operations in accordance 
with the Information Security Strategy and the established Framework.
The main topics covered by these policies and procedures are: Information Security, Security Incident manage-
ment, IT Change & Configuration management, Backup, Hardening, Logging, Cloud Security, BYOD (Bring your 
own device) and Removable Devices management. 
During 2019, the framework was strengthened by introducing new policies to address better the new generation 
of IT technologies and processes that necessarily require more attention.
Security documents, such as policies, procedures and operating instructions, are systematically revised and sha-
red with employees, published on the Corporate intranet and made available via specific on-line training.
In 2017 Prysmian launched a Cyber Security programme to strengthen information security through a well-defi-
ned set of initiatives to reduce overall cyber and compliance risks over time.
