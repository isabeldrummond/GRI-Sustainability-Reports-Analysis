for the energy transition
The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources is one of 
the greatest and most urgent challenges faced by humanity.
The production of electricity and heat generates 25% of all global CO  
2
emissions.  
Europe was one of the first economies to make formal commitments, establishing the objectives for 2030: 40% 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions with respect to the 1990 level; 32% of energy needs met by renewable 
sources and an improvement in energy efficiency by at least 32.5%1. Signature of the new Green Plan by the Eu-
ropean Commission in December 2019 seeks to make Europe carbon neutral by 2050, highlighting the priority 
need for an integrated energy market that is digitalised and interconnected with renewable sources.  
That said, the development of renewable energy in Europe, North America and the Asian countries with the lar-
gest impact on CO emissions is still heavily restricted by the need for substantial investment.

Accordingly, the Prysmian Group is deeply committed to supporting the development of smarter and more 
sustainable electricity grids. In order to achieve the ambitious decarbonisation objective set by Europe, the 
European Commission estimates that the offshore wind energy needed by 2050 will total 450 GW.
To deliver this, the offshore wind power sector will need an efficient, sustainable and reliable electricity tran-
smission system, capable of supporting the transition to renewable energy at ever more competitive costs.
