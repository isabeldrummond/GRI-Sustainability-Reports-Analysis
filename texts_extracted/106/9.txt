Sustainability is in the DNA
of the Prysmian Group
ESG FULLY INTEGRATED
As a “fully integrated” ESG Group, we have adopted concrete and measurable actions 
within a plan ensuring that our activities take full account of the economic, social and 
environmental aspects considered by the sustainability indexes to which we belong, 
as well as the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030 and the require-
ments identified by listening to all our stakeholders.
PUBLIC COMPANY
We are in primis a Public Company with a broad shareholder base and, as such, it is 
fundamental to align the interests of the Group with those of all our stakeholders. 
Accordingly, we have always maintained open and transparent dialogue with our 
shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers, with the institutions and with 
the communities in which we work. 
We are committed to ensuring the highest international standards of governance: 
for example, 67% of Board members are independent and 42% are women. Integri-
ty as a corporate value is expressed using a series of instruments and policies: the 
Code of Ethics, the anti-corruption policy, privacy and data protection, and the hel-
pline programme that facilitates the transparent management of issues.
