GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Greenhouse gas emissions, measured in tonnes of CO equivalent, were calculated using the methodologies 
2
indicated in “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition, 
2004)” considering, for the Scope 1 GHG emissions (direct greenhouse gas emissions), the consumption of fuels, 
the release of overflow refrigerant gas and the release of SF  and, for the Scope 2 GHG emissions (indirect emis-

sions of greenhouse gases), the consumption of purchased energy (mainly electricity).
The Prysmian Group is a multinational and diversified concern; for this reason, and consistent with the requi-
rements of the reporting standard, two main methods for accounting for emissions in Scope 2 are used: the 
Location-based method and the Market-based method. Both methods, described below, are recognised and re-
quired by the GHG Protocol and are necessary for the reporting of Scope 2 emissions in the “CDP’s Climate Change 
programme” starting in 2016.
