BENDBRIGHTXS 180Î¼m - Revolutionary innovation for broadband
Prysmian has launched the first fibre in the world that can be 
bent at will, with a diameter of 180 microns that allows cable 
miniaturisation at a level never before achieved. Optical fibre 
cables are a crucial part of the global transition to flexible and 
reliable connectivity. Their large number of fibres and reduced 
diameter makes installation quicker and cheaper. This innovation 
confirms the commitment of Prysmian to support the evolution 
of high density optical networks.
Interconnection of the Cycladic islands
Prysmian is achieving a new first thanks to a new cable with synthetic sheathing that is about 30% lighter 
than steel, thus paving the way to new scenarios in which installations at great depth, up to 3,000 metres, 
will be possible.
The Group is using this new technology for the undersea electrical interconnection of the Cycladic Islands, 
Evia, Andros and Tinos, involving the design, supply and installation of two high voltage AC cables that will 
increase energy transmission between the islands, ensuring solidity, reliability and sustainability.
