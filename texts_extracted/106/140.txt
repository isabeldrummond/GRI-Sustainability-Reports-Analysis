Prysmian Group    Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 139
SERVICE TIMELINESS AND EFFICIENCY  
The Prysmian Group continued its strategic focus on Customer Centricity during 2019, stabilising the high level 
of service achieved in terms of delivery reliability and starting work to reduce the lead-time between the receipt 
of an order to delivery of the product to the customer. 
Prysmian has confirmed our strong orientation to continuous improvement in the punctuality and reliability of 
our processes. As highlighted in the chart below, in 2019 the On Time Delivery (OTD) parameter, which measures 
the ability to respect the delivery date promised to the customer upon confirmation of the order, maintained 
the high levels of reliability achieved in the previous year in both the Energy Products and Telecom areas.

The former General Cable plants, now part of the Prysmian Group, started to collect reliability information sy-
stematically in 201944, 
In order to accelerate customer response times, Prysmian continued during 2019 to implement a strategy for 
reducing the time taken to input and manage sales orders. This has improved telephone waiting times for custo-
mers and increase the ‘quality’ time available to manage their orders. 
Since the immediate availability of goods has become increasingly important in order to meet the needs of 
customers, during 2019 the Group maintained and expanded to additional plants the monitoring of available 
stocks, with a view to improving the time to market. The weekly availability of each category of Make-to-Stock 
products (high, medium and slow rotation) is monitored against the minimum stock-holding levels established 
with reference to annual sales (stock fill rate). For monitoring purposes, an interactive stock control system has 
been made implemented, filtered by product category and plant. A minimum stock level is calculated for each 
product code and the possible stock out is highlighted.
To limit possible delays and improve the reliability of the business, even for ‘Make-To-Order’ products, the CLIP 
index is updated weekly on the SAP 1 Client platform. Supplementing the traditional service indicators, this in-
dex measures the reliability of production compared to planned targets.  
44  The Prysmian plants within the former General Cable perimeter calculate On Time Delivery (OTD) in a different way to the other Prysmian Group plants, which have 
carried out this analysis since 2013. In addition, the data for 6 GC plants (4 for Energy and 2 for Telecom) has been included in the Prysmian data since their migration 
to the SAP system. With regard to the methodology adopted, the data for both Prysmian and GC plants represents the average of the OTDs of each plant, as weighted 
using the number of lines shipped.
