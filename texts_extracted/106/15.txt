14 Prysmian Group    Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019
World leader in the supply
of power and telecom cables  
With sales in excess of Euro 11.5 billion, approximately 29,000 
employees and 106 plants in more than 50 countries, the Group
has a consolidated presence in technologically advanced markets.
The broadest range of products, services, technologies and know how 
are offered to manufacturers that use cabling systems in the production 
and distribution of energy and telecommunications. 
Established at the end of the 1800s as Pirelli Cables, the Prysmian Group has grown by acquisitions: from 
absorption of the activities of Siemens and Nokia in the power cables sector, to the more recent acquisition 
of the Draka group, based in the Netherlands, and, in 2018, to the takeover of General Cable, a US group.
The history of the Group spans the entire cables industry, with aggregations that sustained expansion of the 
products and services offered, with constant innovations, improving standards and a greater geographical 
presence, which is a significant strength when serving regional market needs. 
This leadership extends to business control as well. An industry leader has emerged over time, not only in 
terms of know-how and technological skills, but also with regard to effective operational control. The pro-
ven ability to identify synergies and lower costs rapidly ensures operational efficiency at the highest level 
within the sector.
