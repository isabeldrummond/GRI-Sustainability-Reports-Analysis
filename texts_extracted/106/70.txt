The geographical ownership structure shows a predominant presence of the United States, with 28% of capital 
held by institutional investors, followed by the United Kingdom with 21%, both essentially unchanged with re-
spect to the prior year. Italy is represented with about 13% of capital held by institutional investors, down since 
2018, while France has increased slightly to 12%. The proportion of Asian investors (principally Japan and Hong 
Kong) was basically unchanged.
Overall, around 70% of the share capital held by institutional investors is represented by investment funds with 
Value, Growth or GARP strategies, therefore focused on a medium to long-term investment horizon. The wei-
ghting of shareholders adopting an Index investment strategy, based on the main stock indices, is stable with 
respect to 2018, while the weighting of the Hedge Fund component - with a shorter time horizon - has decreased 
to 2% of the total.
