The specific research carried out in 2019 includes:
  together with Rice University, the Company is striving to create an inter-sector consortium called Car-
bonHub and a think tank for obtaining clean energy from the hydrogen and advanced carbon mate-
rials that are co-produced efficiently and sustainably from natural gas and petroleum;
  together with the Fraunhofer Institute, we have developed optical fibre sensors based on Fibre Bragg 
Gratings;
  together with Università di Padova, we have perfected new materials that can be extruded for the 
insulation of fire-resistant cables, as a replacement for mica tapes;
  together with Politecnico di Milano and the University of Lille, we have developed a coating for opti-
cal fibres using bio-derived raw materials;
  together within the University of Strasbourg, we have obtained a good understanding of the mecha-
nism for the decomposition of polymers during fires, which will provide a basis for developing a new 
line of LS0H compounds;
  together with Università di Palermo, we are working on the advanced characterisation and testing of 
high voltage cables and materials.
