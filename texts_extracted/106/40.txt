The three priority topics identified by both the Group and Prysmian’s stakeholders are:
Occupational health and safety: the Group intends to strengthen the systems for managing occupational 
health and safety, in order to reduce the number of injuries and occupational diseases and, via suitable trai-
ning programmes, develop a culture of prevention and management covering these two aspects.
Ethics and integrity: this topic includes the Group’s commitment to a business management model based on 
the most stringent standards of business ethics and integrity, especially with regard to the measures adop-
ted to prevent both active and passive corruption.
Solutions for sustainable applications: this topic includes the Group’s commitment to develop solutions 
that may generate sustainability benefits (e.g. solutions for plants that generate renewable energy, smart 
grids, innovative solutions for the electrical system).
The “Risk management” topic was assessed by the Group’s stakeholders but, although important and relevant to 
all aspects of sustainability, it was not included in the 2019 matrix; however, “Risk management” is addressed in 
all the material topics identified by the Group.
The 2019 updated materiality matrix has been validated by the Compensation, Appointments and Sustainability 
Committee.
