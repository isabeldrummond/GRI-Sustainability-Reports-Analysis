Prysmian Group    Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 31
The Group completed the priority definition process in 2016. Analysis considered the main global and industry 
trends, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 (SDGs) defined by the United Nations, requests from 
major International Sustainability Indexes (Dow Jones Sustainability Index, FTSE4GOOD, CDP, Bloomberg ESG, 
etc.) and the needs and expectations of the Groupâ€™s stakeholders, which are mapped each year through sta-
keholder engagement initiatives undertaken by the Group.
The analysis was then supplemented by strategic guidance from the Compensation, Appointments and Sustai-
nability Committee of the Board of Directors, establishing the strategic priorities and, therefore, the related 
KPIs, targets and actions needed to achieve them. 
The SDGs played a key role in defining the objectives of the Group, enabling the Prysmian Group to supplement 
its own priorities with those identified by the UN and compare its strategic sustainability goals with those adop-
ted at a global level. 
The Prysmian Group has identified 13 SDGs with a direct business impact, 5 of which are considered to be the most 
important: Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), Affor-
dable and clean energy (SDG 7), Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and Gender equality (SDG 5). 
These are supplemented by the suggestions that emerge from annual meetings with Stakeholders and the re-
quirements of the main Sustainability Indexes.
