Prysmian Group    Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement 2019 95
For details of the Antitrust inquiries in progress, see paragraph 14. Provisions for risks and charges in the Expla-
natory Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: the Group has recorded a provision for risks and charges 
of about Euro 223 million at 31 December 2019. Despite the uncertain outcome of the investigations in progress 
and the potential disputes promoted by customers as a consequence of the decision adopted by the European 
Commission in April 2014, as described in the Explanatory Notes (Note 14. Provisions for risks and charges), this 
provision is deemed to represent the best estimate of liabilities based on the information currently available. 
In addition, the European Court of Justice ruling on 14 November 2019 rejected the appeal presented by General 
Cable against the anti-trust decision adopted by the European Commission on 2 April 2014, definitively confir-
ming the penalty levied in the EC decision. As a result, the Group has paid a penalty of Euro 2 million.
PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION IN THE PRYSMIAN GROUP  
Given the growing globalisation of the business, the proliferation of access to information channels and the con-
stant increase in the volume and type of data managed, it has become essential for the Group to adopt an overall 
vision in the management of sensitive information, not only in terms of regulatory compliance - as described in 
the Group Annual Report, in the section on Risk Factors and Uncertainties - but also with regard to security and 
our business priorities.
Furthermore, the European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) entered into force in May 2018 and be-
came one of the major points of reference for a renewed effort in the area of data protection, with a focus on 
personal data.
The programme for the protection of personal data adopted by Prysmian is based on the following fundamental 
elements that involve the entire business structure:
  implementation of a “data centric” model, by mapping the personal data processed by the business fun-
ctions and keeping a register of processing activities;
  definition of a governance model designed to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and other emer-
ging data protection requirements, marked by: 
–  an organisational structure that assigns an advisory and monitoring role to the data protection officer 
(DPO) in the management of personal data, delegating duties and the related responsibilities to the roles 
that actually process that data;
–  a series of policies and documents that support the model (business policies, information sheets, inter-
nal appointments, clauses applicable to suppliers etc.);
  implementation of adequate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate 
to the risk, partly with the help of new tools such as the data protection impact assessment introduced by the 
GDPR;
  definition of communication and training materials specifically reserved for the roles identified within the 
data protection organisational model, so that all roles involved are aware of the renewed regulatory obliga-
tions and take steps to implement all specified requirements;
  update of video surveillance systems, with particular reference to the new European guidelines and the re-
gulations applicable in Italy.
Application of the model has been accompanied by monitoring and the provision of support to the numerous 
Prysmian legal entities in Europe, in order to ensure consistent application of the established controls and a 
shared corporate culture. In addition, partly as a result of acquiring General Cable in 2018, which increased the 
globalisation of the Group, the provision of monitoring and support commenced in order to extend the data 
protection model defined centrally by Prysmian to the various non-European legal entities.
