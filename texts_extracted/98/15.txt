The Code of Ethics contains all the values that inspire the Orsero Group's way of doing 
things on a daily basis : transparency, fairness and loyalty. All those who operate in Italy 
or abroad or on behalf of the Company and the Group, each in the framework of their 
own functions and responsibilities, are called to respect the principles and provisions con-
tained in the Code itself. The Group's Code of Ethics encompasses all of Orsero's own 
values, representing an opportunity not only to formalize excellences already consoli-
dated over time, but also to define guidelines for the actions and the behavior of those 
who identify themselves and deal with the Orsero world on a daily basis. 
 
Security is a fundamental component of the operating proce-
dures for the management of processes that, by nature, require 
particular attention towards workers, collaborators, customers 
and the social context in which the Company operates. 
 
 
To meet the needs of safety, health and working conditions, a suitable supervision and 
control policy is pursued and implemented in the sites where the Group operates. The 
internal control system, composed of the set of tools, activities, procedures and organi-
zational structures, aims to ensure: 
  The effectiveness and efficiency of company activities; 
  The reliability of accounting and management information; 
  Compliance with laws and regulations; 
  Protecting the integrity and corporate assets  
 
The Orsero Code of Ethics has the objective of collecting and sharing the rules and prin-
ciples of conduct which, since the foundation of the Company, establish relations with 
both personnel and third parties and which, more generally, characterize the develop-
ment of the corporate activity.
