2019 ISTAT basket: Ginger appears 
 
Ginger is the rhizome of an herbaceous plant native to the Far East, cultivated 
nowadays in the whole tropical and subtropical belt of the world and also in Italy. 
It became popular thanks to its nutritional properties, in 2019 it became part of the 
ISTAT basket, which identifies the goods most purchased by Italian families. 
The word "ginger" comes from the Greek zingiberis, which in turn comes from Tamil 
ingiver. The etymology of the term reconstructs the export routes of the spice, 
which already in ancient times travelled in dried and pulverized form on the route 
that from the East - in particular from India - reached the Mediterranean basin..
