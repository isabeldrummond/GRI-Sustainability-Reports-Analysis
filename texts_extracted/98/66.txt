The Orsero Group distributes fruit and vegetable products throughout Southern Europe 
and, thanks to a widespread distribution throughout the territory, supplies the major su-
permarkets and wholesalers in Italy, Spain, France, Portugal and Greece. 
As regards the product distribution sector, four main categories of product or supply 
channel can be defined. In particular, pineapples and bananas play an extremely im-
portant role, representing almost 45% of the distribution of the year (2019). Given the size 
of the market and the continuous demand from customers and consumers, the Orsero 
Group deals with part of the business thanks to the “Cale Rosse” fleet owned by the 
Group.
