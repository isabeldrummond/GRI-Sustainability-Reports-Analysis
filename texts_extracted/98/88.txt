Energy consumption 
 
The energy consumption of Orsero is monitored so that a complete view of it is available 
for the planning of energy efficiency measures, with particular reference to the ware-
houses in which the Group operates. The Group's activities carried out in the warehouses 
include product processing and packaging as the main processes.  For this reason, en-
ergy consumption is limited to refrigeration systems, the power supply of the machines in 
the warehouses and a few other functions, such as lighting or heating of the rooms. Fi-
nally, all the means inside the warehouses run on electricity: therefore, no other energy 
vectors are used, except to heat the office spaces.
