   
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  2019   â–ª 2 
The consolidated financial statements show a profit of Euro 2,264 thousand, of which Euro 
2,022 thousand attributable to the Group after depreciation and amortisation of Euro 
25,753 thousand, net non-recurring charges of Euro 4,575 thousand, net income/expense 
for Euro 959 thousand and the pro-quota share of the companies consolidated under 
shareholders' equity for 751 thousand Euro. 
During 2019, the Group focused on the growth of the Distribution sector, both in terms of 
internal channels, in particular the development of the fresh-cut fruit business in Italy with 
the setting up of three processing rooms located in the Verona and Molfetta warehouses 
and, in respect to the rented structure in Cagliari, and the external ones, such as the 
acquisitions carried out in Spain, France and Italy as mentioned above. The year in ques-
tion was particularly significant in terms of the implementation of the Group's strategy: in 
fact, we finalised significant acquisitions in the distribution sector, continued our commit-
ment to strengthening fresh-cut, and made substantial operational investments on the 
distribution platforms managed by the Group. 
As already mentioned, the performance in 2019, with the exclusion of French operations, 
remained at the levels of the previous year, despite the usual variations from one year to 
the next between the Group's various companies. 
Given the nature of the Orsero Group's own activities, there are no basic or applied re-
search activities that can be traced, however, the Group is carrying forwards with the 
development, testing and engineering of a new integrated information and manage-
ment system that is currently not available on the market, implemented ad hoc to meet 
the particular needs of the distribution sector and innovative economic/financial plan-
ning tools necessary to meet some of the requirements for access to the MTA market.     
In recent years, the Orsero Group has implemented a strategy of focusing on its core-
business; this strategy and the activities and operations carried out alongside have laid 
the foundations for the Group's potential growth and expansion in a field characterized 
by the concentration in the main markets of reference. The strong competitive position-
ing and a solid financial structure appropriate to the business made possible the acquisi-
tions made in the last financial year, while remaining very careful in ensuring that the 
sellers requirements of target companies are appropriate and adequate to the risk profile 
of such activities. 
The Group's strategy is clear and aimed at a persistent focus on distribution in the markets 
of reference with the aim of strengthening its competitive stance with great attention to 
its margins. In the immediate period ahead of us, while remaining attentive to taking ad-
vantage of possible growth opportunities as a result of new acquisitions, we plan to con-
tinue to focus on achieving operational synergies, an ever-improving efficiency of the 
structure and a growing focus on Corporate Social Responsibility in order to further in-
crease the company's the solidity and value. The Group's commitment is reflected in the 
first "Sustainability Report" with which it plans to share its activities with all stakeholders in
