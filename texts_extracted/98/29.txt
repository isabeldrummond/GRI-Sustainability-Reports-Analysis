Legal and compliance risks 
 
Risks related to potential environmental damage  
The Orsero Group is exposed to the risk that any failure or serious breakage may 
occur to ships, plants or machinery that could cause damage to third parties, 
accidents or environmental damage. The Orsero Group, through dedicated of-
fices, carries on all the activities necessary to ensure the respect of the environ-
ment, optimizing the use of energy sources and natural resources. 
 
 
Risks related to the administrative liability of legal entities 
The Group is exposed to the risk of incurring the administrative liability of the en-
tities provided for by Legislative Decree 231 and any penalties imposed by the 
said decree (or by any similar local regulations applicable) due to any assess-
ment of the inadequacy of the model adopted, pursuant to the aforemen-
tioned decree, by the Holding Company and the Italian subsidiaries and/or due 
to the non-application of a similar model by the Group's foreign companies. The 
occurrence of such circumstances, which are deemed to be of low probability, 
would entail a risk that could have a negative impact on the Group's operating 
performance, financial position and financial position. Since 2010, the Orsero 
Group (formerly GF Group) has adopted the organizational model, the code of 
ethics and appointed the ethics committee provided for by Legislative Decree 
8 June 2011, as well as the supervisory body, in order to ensure compliance with 
the prescribed conditions of fairness and transparency in the conduct of busi-
ness activities, to protect the position and image of the company, the expecta-
tions of shareholders and the work of employees. The model is a valuable tool 
to raise awareness of all those who work on behalf of the Orsero Group, so that 
they behave correctly and linearly in the performance of their activities, and a 
means of prevention against the risk of committing crimes. Please note that 
Model 231 and the Code of Ethics can be consulted in the corporate govern-
ance section of the website www.orserogroup.it .  
 
For a complete list of the risk profiles of the Group's activities, please refer to the specific 
section in the Consolidated Financial Reporting at 31 December 2019.
