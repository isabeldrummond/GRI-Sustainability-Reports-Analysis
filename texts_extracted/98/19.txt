focus on: 
The road to the billion: mission achieved 
 
On February 13, 2017, the Orsero Group made its debut at Piazza Affari; the Savona 
company arrived at AIM Italia, the Italian Stock Exchange market dedicated to 
small and medium-sized enterprises, following the incorporation into the already 
listed Glenalta Food, a vehicle company specifically created and listed in 2015 to 
collect resources used in the acquisition of a target company to lead to listing. The 
availability of around 50 million euros contributed by the new share-holders served 
to consolidate the international presence of the Group and to further promote 
growth through external lines, with particular attention to Italy, France and Spain. 
Secondly, the new availability of capital will be a useful tool for entering the mar-
keting of adjoining merchandise classes, such as dried fruit or portioned products, 
such as IV.  
Since December 23, 2019, the Orsero shares have been listed on the STAR segment 
of the Italian Stock Exchange, at the end of a process that saw the Group first enter 
the AIM market, thanks to the merger with Glenalta in February 2017, and finally 
reach the main market, with a quantum leap both in terms of visibility of the stock 
and the necessary implementation of the internal governance structure, of which 
an extensive account is given in the "Governance Report". 
 
The objective of reaching a turnover of one billion euros was achieved starting 
from 2019, characterized by the implementation of important strategic and oper-
ational investments that lay the foundations for the Group's future growth and de-
velopment.
