Our priorities 
Security, product traceability and quality 
The Orsero Group strives daily to bring the best quality fruits to the tables throughout Europe, 
controlling every phase of the supply chain, to ensure freshness, taste and safety. 
 
Sustainable management of supply chain  
The supply chain plays a fundamental role within a business, and even more so in the agri-
cultural sector. To guarantee the best products to all customers, the Orsero Group selects 
the best land and local producers. The constant dialogue with the suppliers guarantees 
quality and control over the entire supply chain. 
 
Development of human capital and promotion of corporate welfare 
Employees and collaborators are the engine of the Orsero Group. The Group is committed 
to promoting work-life balance and ensuring fair and stable work relationships based on the 
respect and promotion of talent. 
 
Ethics and responsible business The Orsero Group, like all the subjects with which the organ-
ization collaborates and interacts, puts the management of the activities in the first place in 
an ethical and responsible manner. Value creation must be guided by the principles of sus-
tainability, guaranteeing respect, fairness and business ethics. 
 
Energy and atmospheric emissions management, waste management 
The environmental impact of Orsero products is constantly monitored, with the prospect of 
an improvement of the efficiency of the resources used. The Group is committed to reduc-
ing consumption and fighting waste, with a focus on innovation and packaging.    
 
Nutrition and Welfare  
Orsero's mission is to bring healthy and nutritious products throughout European tables, 
promoting the adoption of a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet. For this reason Orsero 
puts its signature on its products and on its controlled and certified fruits and vegetables.
