2019 ISTAT BASKET: berries appears 
 
The berries are born on small shrubs, often perennial, which grow in semi-shade in 
places with humid and cold climate, typical of the undergrowth. 
The range includes: 
  The raspberries have a soft flesh and a sweet and delicate taste. 
  The red currant, with its red color and acidulous taste. 
  The wild strawberries, with their firm and sweet flesh. 
  The blueberries, dark in color and crispy flesh. 
  Blackberries, with a soft texture and sweet taste. 
 
Always widespread in Italy, their nutritional properties have recently become more 
popular, and in 2019 they became part of the ISTAT basket, which identifies the 
goods most purchased by Italian families. 
 
Benefits of berries 
Like all fruits, berries also contain water, fiber and mineral salts in abundance. But 
the peculiarity of berries is another: in fact, these berries are rich in certain antioxi-
dant substances, i.e. they fight cellular aging. These are flavonoids. 
In this case, flavonoids fight capillary fragility, a disturbance that causes the ap-
pearance of annoying symptoms including cellulite and varicose veins. Blueberry, 
in particular, thanks to the properties of flavonoids of which it is rich, becomes an 
excellent food for those with vision problems.  
Berries are also rich in plant sterols, molecules known for their effectiveness in con-
trolling blood cholesterol levels as they reduce absorption by the intestine. Finally, 
the berries are rich in vitamin C, essential for good health especially in the cold 
season.
