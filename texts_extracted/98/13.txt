Passion and determination: values of Orsero  
 
 
 
Family is the starting point and destination of Orsero; it is from the family that the Group 
draws its most profound origins, and it is for families that Orsero works to constantly im-
prove the quality of its products. In the same way, without losing sight of their traditions, 
Orsero carries his Italian spirit in his heart, which represents a determined and stubborn 
way of living and working. 
Orsero products carry the brand that has always distinguished the Group: commitment, 
know-how, dedication, care and love. Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, Greece, Costa Rica, 
Colombia and Mexico share the same values and ideals of the Orsero world.
