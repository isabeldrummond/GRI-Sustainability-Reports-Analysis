In 2017, the Group was named “Orsero SpA” following the merger with Glenalta Food 
and was listed on the AIM Italia stock market. Today Orsero is particularly focused on its 
core business, strategically expanding the distribution sector with the acquisition of total 
control of two Joint Ventures in Italy and another in Spain, active in the distribution of 
fresh fruit and vegetables. 
During 2018, in line with the group's mission to focus its strategy on "core business", the 
Spanish subsidiary Hermanos Fernández López S.A. is included in the share capital of the 
company Bonaoro S.L.U. active in the production, storage, packaging, marketing, export 
and import of Canary Island bananas and the entire capital of the company Sevimpor 
Distribuidora De Frutas De Importacion S. dedicated to the wholesale distribution of fresh 
fruit and vegetables and specialized in the ripening of bananas from the Canary Islands, 
thus strengthening its territorial presence.  
Also in 2018, the Group acquired a 19% stake in Moño Azul S.A. due to its strategic im-
portance as a supplier of pears and apples of primary interest to the Group. 
In 2019 the Group sees the continuation of the "Fresh Cut" expansion activity, with the 
opening of three new centers in Molfetta, Verona and Cagliari. This is the year of the 
acquisitions of Fruttica Group, the consolidation of Fruttital Cagliari. As of 23 December 
2019, the Orsero shares are listed on the STAR segment of the Italian Stock Exchange, with 
a quantum leap both in terms of stock visibility and the necessary implementation of the 
internal governance structure.
