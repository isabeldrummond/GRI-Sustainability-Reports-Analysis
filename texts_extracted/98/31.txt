   
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  2019   â–ª 30 
Group stakeholders  
In carrying out its activities, the Orsero Group comes into contact with numerous categories of stake-
holders, subjects with whom the Group collaborates, dialogues and interacts. Stakeholders also have 
a primary role thanks to their ability to influence the business and to be influenced by it at the same 
time. Ahead of the publication of the first Sustainability Report, an activity was carried out, aimed 
specifically at identifying the main stakeholders of the Orsero Group, which represent fundamental 
players for the creation of the Group's value.
