Risk Management  
 
The Risk Assessment and Risk Management activity, aimed at identifying the operating 
areas potentially exposed to risk, led to the identification of some of the most sensitive 
business activity profiles. With respect to these topics, the Orsero Group is committed to 
a constant and careful monitoring, which can guarantee the Group's future growth pro-
spects and the efficiency of its business activities. 
With a view to increasing compliance with the requirements of Legislative Decree 254/16 
and a more in-depth knowledge of the impacts generated and suffered, Orsero is com-
mitted to integrate its risk mapping with an analysis of the main ESG factors (Environmen-
tal, Social, Governance), including climate change. 
Due to the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic in the first months of 2020, the Group's man-
agement carefully monitors the evolution of the situation, without noticing for the mo-
ment noteworthy effects on the financial statements. However, it cannot be excluded 
that if the situation were to continue over time in an important way, and new and more 
stringent limitations were to be introduced at Italian and European level with reference 
to logistics and the movement of goods, economic, social and environmental impacts 
could be generated which currently cannot be quantified. 
The Group has taken steps to implement suitable safety and control measures to ensure 
operational continuity in the production sites, through careful management of the emer-
gency and the reorganization of the work activity to safeguard the health and safety of 
the people. As part of the continuous monitoring activity it carries out, management will 
promptly notify the market of any negative change in the overall framework in which the 
company operates and, if possible, will make estimates of the potential impacts of Covid-
19. 
 
Risks related to external markets 
 
Risks related to the macroeconomic trend  
The economic results and the balance sheet of the Orsero Group are influenced 
by factors that reflect the macroeconomic trends, such as consumption trends, 
labor costs and interest rate trends. Although the core business of the Orsero 
Group is represented by the marketing of fresh fruit and vegetables, a sector 
linked to primary consumption, thus substantially stable and not very sensitive to 
changes in the macroeconomic context, the international situation is closely 
monitored in order to adapt commercial strategies and confirm growth expec-
tations, if needed.
