Initiatives against food waste  
 
The Orsero Group is committed to fighting food waste: in addition to the adoption 
of practices consolidated over time to reduce waste during the transport and stor-
age phases of the products, the Group, thanks to the implementation of initiatives 
for the benefit of the community, gives value to every single product. 
To guarantee the minimization of food waste, during the different stages of the 
supply chain, the products are subjected to continuous quality controls: the timeli-
ness of the controls allows for the continuous verification of product safety, guar-
anteeing freshness. 
The warehouses have the possibility to make partnerships with local associations 
and organizations, to minimize waste and the loss of edible but non-commercial 
products.
