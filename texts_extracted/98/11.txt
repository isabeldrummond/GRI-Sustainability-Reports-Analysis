The value of Orsero is the result of a perfect gear that finds fulfillment in commitment, 
organization, efficiency, tradition and innovation. Orsero uses state-of-the-art vehicles 
that allow transport by sea and by land without ever breaking the cold chain; fruit and 
vegetables from every corner of the planet reach the warehouses to complete the mat-
uration cycle and be distributed throughout Southern Europe. Every day, Orsero’s fruit 
and vegetables are shipped from the warehouses managed by the Group to fill the fruit 
and vegetable stalls of the main Mediterranean supermarkets and wholesalers. With over 
100 customers in the large-scale retail trade, more than 10.000 customers among tradi-
tional wholesalers and a daily presence in over 20 fruit and vegetable market stands, 
Orsero is the reference player in all the markets of Mediterranean Europe.
