employees. In the countries of the EEC area, 99% of employees are covered by collective 
bargaining agreements. In non-EU countries (where, as at 31 December 2019, 198 em-
ployees were employed), employees are not covered by collective bargaining agree-
ments, as this type of contract is not provided for.
