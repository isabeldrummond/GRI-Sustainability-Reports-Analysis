Materiality analysis 
 
The Orsero Group has developed an initial analysis of the significant sus-
tainability issues through an internal materiality process: the constant 
dialogue already in place between the management and the Group's 
stakeholder has allowed the identification of the issues relevant to the 
organization and its stakeholders. 
 
The materiality analysis was conducted in order to identify and prioritize the issues that influence the 
Group's ability to create value and those deemed relevant by the Group's stakeholders. 
The starting point was the analysis of the aspects of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, and 
those indicated by the publication "Sustainability Topics for Sectors: What do stakeholders want to 
know?" GRI, 2013). These were enriched by an analysis of industry benchmarks and the topics men-
tioned by other publications in the area of sustainability. The evaluation of the relevant issues was 
carried out through an internal workshop involving the main business functions and top management 
and led to the definition of the materiality matrix below. The Group, with a view to increasing the 
involvement of its stakeholders, will undertake, starting next year, a gradual extension of its activities 
and stakeholder engagement initiatives, also with a view to updating the materiality analysis. 
In the matrix, the aspects that are most relevant for the Group and its stakeholder are placed in the 
upper right quadrant and represent a strategic priority for the Group. The materiality matrix offers a 
representation of all the organization’s significant economic, environmental and social impacts, 
which also substantially influence stakeholder assessments and decisions.
