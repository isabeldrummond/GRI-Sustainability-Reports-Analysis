Fratelli Orsero’s Pineapple 
 
Pineapple is a fruit native to Southern Brazil and Paraguay. It was Christopher Columbus who intro-
duced it in Europe, giving way to a trade network that today exports it all over the world. 
The pineapple is considered the king of tropical fruit, it was called “pineapple” by the British for its 
resemblance to a pine cone and for its heart full of juice, which resembles the apple. The natives 
who cultivated it called it "anana", from which it derives its name in Italian and in other languages. 
The Spanish explorers, on the other hand, called it "indian pinecone", and the Europeans who could 
afford this exclusive fruit nicknamed it the "royal pinecone".  
The Fratelli Orsero’s pineapples are the fruits of Costa Rican plantations. “Extra sweet” pineapples, so 
called because of their juicy pulp and sweet unmistakable scent, grow in sunny fields. 
 
Pineapples grow on the homonymous plant, a bush that is grown primarily in Central and South Amer-
ica. At the center of the plant, surrounded by spiny leaves, the fruit grows: a large oval cone sur-
mounted by a tuft of green leaves, with a fleshy and appetizing pulp.
