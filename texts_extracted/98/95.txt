For the packing and packaging of fruit and vegetables, different types of material are 
used, necessary to transport and protect the product.  
   
 
focus on: 
Minimizing the impacts of logistics with 
pooling supplies 
 
 
 
The Group has started various collaborations with companies active in the supply 
of pallets and fruit and vegetable boxes in pooling: thanks to the pooling supplies, 
the pallet and the boxes are collected from the large-scale retail trade and then 
redistributed to the warehouses, avoiding the disposal of material that can be re-
used. 
In Spain, for example, a partnership is active with the company CHEP - wooden 
pallet manufacturer - which has carried out an analysis relating to the environmen-
tal impacts of its product, carried out using the Life Cycle Assessment methodol-
ogy, which measures raises of the environmental impacts during the entire life cy-
cle of the product, from production to disposal. The study found that CHEP pallets 
have the least environmental impact compared to other packaging categories. 
In particular, each pallet is produced from renewable sources, certified to 100% 
FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and PEFC (Program for Endorsement of Forest 
Certification).
