The improvement in the women-men pay gap in 2019 is due to the consolidation 
of the actions aimed at improving the gender balance in the company. In 
addition, as evidence of the Snam's commitment to guarantee gender balance, 
in 2019 the Shareholders' Meeting approved, with the 99% of votes in favour, a 
change to the by-laws, which makes the criterion of gender distribution in the 
Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors permanent for at least 
one third of the total members.
