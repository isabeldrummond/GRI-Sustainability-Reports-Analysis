GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
The main greenhouse gas emissions (or GHG) resulting from Snam's activities are 
methane (CH), the main component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide (CO). 
4 2
Methane emissions arise from the release of natural gas into the atmosphere 
and are generated by the normal plant operation, by operations to connect new 
gas pipelines and the maintenance thereof, or by accidental events occurring 
on infrastructure, whereas the CO produced is directly correlated with fuel 
2
consumption and the fuel. In 2019, like last year, the marginal contribution 
to direct emissions from the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) in refrigeration 
systems was assessed as equal to approximately 1.48 kt CO .

GHG total emissions 
-2.6%   In line with the international reporting methods for GHG emissions, Snam broke 
down and analysed its emissions into Scope 1 direct emissions and Scope 2 
indirect emissions from energy use and Scope 3 other indirect emissions. Direct 
compared to 2018 
emissions refer to Snam's fuel consumption, while indirect emissions refer to 
electricity consumption and heat consumption (Scope 2) and other CO emissions 
2
released along the company's value chain (Scope 3).
The total GHG emissions stood at around 1.92 thousand tonnes of CO  (-2.6% 
2eq
compared to 2018). The total reduction in emissions is mainly due to the 
interventions implemented to reduce direct emissions (Scope 1), which, however, 
was mitigated by the increase compared with the previous year of Scope 3 indirect 
emissions relating to business travel and the emissions generated along the 
supply chain. Specifically, Snam adopted various initiatives to reduce emissions, 
such as, for example:
These activities have allowed the  •  recovery of natural gas emissions;
Company to prevent the emission  •  production of electricity from photovoltaic plants;
into the atmosphere of 181,800  •  acquisition of green electricity;
tonnes of CO , the highest figure  •  installation of LED lighting systems;
2eq
in recent years (+17% compared to  •  renovation and efficiency improvements for buildings;
2018). •  greater use of smart working among employees.
