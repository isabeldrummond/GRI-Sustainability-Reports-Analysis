 
 
and apply procedures in order to obtain limited assurance that the Report is free from material 
misstatement.  
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less  in scope than those performed 
in a reasonable assurance engagement performed in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised (“reasonable 
assurance engagement”) and, therefore, do not provide us with a sufficient level of assurance that we 
have become aware of all significant facts and circumstances that might be identified in a reasonable 
assurance engagement.  
 
The procedures performed on the Sustainability Report were base on our  professional judgement 
and consisted in interviews, primarily with company personnel responsible for the preparation of the 
information presented in the Report, analysis of documents, recalculations and other verification 
procedures. 
 
In particular,  we performed the following procedures: 
1)  analysis of the reasons for the coexistence of the NFS (Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 
required under Articles 3, 4 and 7 of Legislative Decree 254/2016) and the Sustainability Report 
and the elements that differentiate the two documents; 
2)  analysis of the process aimed at defining the significant reporting areas to be disclosed in the 
Sustainability Report, with regard to the methods for their identification, in terms of priority for 
the various stakeholders, as well as the internal validation of the process findings; 
3)  comparison of the financial information reported in the “Snam’s profile” and “Performance figures 
and indicators” chapters of the Report with the information included in the Group’s Consolidated 
Financial Annual Report; 
4)  understanding of the processes underlying the preparation, collection and management of the 
significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the Report. 
In particular, we held meetings and interviews with the management of Snam SpA and we 
performed limited analysis of documentary evidence, to gather information about the processes 
and procedures for the collection, consolidation, processing and submission of the non-financial 
information to the function responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report. 
 
Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group:  
-  at holding level 
a)  with reference to the qualitative information included in the Sustainability Report, we 
carried out interviews and acquired supporting documentation to verify their consistency 
with available evidence;  
b)  with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical procedures as well as 
limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the accuracy of consolidation of the 
information. 
-  for the following sites, compression plant of Poggio Renatico (Snam Rete Gas SpA) and 
storage plant of Minerbio (Stogit SpA), which were selected on the basis of their activities, 
their contribution to the performance indicators at a consolidated level and their location, we 
carried out site visits during which we met local management and gathered supporting 
documentation, on a sample basis, regarding the correct application of the procedures and 
calculation methods used for the key performance indicators.
