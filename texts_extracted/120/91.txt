100,000 € of Snam procurement  The impact of procurement decisions can be measured in terms of the number 
of people employed, the value of production and added value, generated by 
the purchase of goods and services along the first level of the supply chain 
(direct impacts) and in sectors activated by first level suppliers (indirect impact).

consumption of employees, activated directly and indirectly by acquisitions, 
generates further employment and added value.
The total value of acquisitions made by Snam nationally in 2019 was equal to 
around €1,300 million, more than 83% of total procurement. This generated:
•  around €3,000 million in value of production, from the sum of the value 
generated along the supply chain to create the goods and services and the 
value created in an induced manner, namely the wealth produced by the final 
consumption of employees along the entire supply chain;
•   around €1,300 million of added value (contribution to the Gross Domestic 
Product of Italy);
•   more than 20 thousand full time external jobs for a year (employment 
impact).
