The Sustainability Report
REPORTING PROCESS
Snam has long started an integration track of its reporting processes because “integrated reporting means integrated 
thinking”. This approach has allowed a comprehensive and integrated overview on all the stakeholders and shareholders 
demands, offering a wide, transparent and responsible corporate disclosure leading to a complete view on the 
activities, performances and challenges which Snam faces today.
It’s a yearly voluntary document which Snam publishes since 
Sustainability report 2006 and which aims to describe in a transparent and clear 
2019 way the company’s progresses and points of improvement 
regarding the environmental, social, economic and 
governance topics (ESG).
The document is a knowledge instrument to punctually 
communicate the company’s activities and targets achieved 
in relation to sustainability also referring to the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).
The aim of the document is to strengthen the relationship 
and collaboration with a wide audience of stakeholders 
(citizens, institutions, communities, media, shareholders, 
investors, employees, suppliers, customers, authorities…).
The report is drafted according to the Comprehensive 
option of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.
