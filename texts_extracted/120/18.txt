KEY FINANCIAL FIGURES (1)

investors, achieving positive results thanks to the rigorous and efficient management

+7.4% +8.2% reaching €1,417 million.

with 2018 (+8.2%). This increase, in addition to the greater EBIT (€12 million, +0.9%), 
1,093
1,010 is due to lower net financial expense (+€30 million or 15.4%), thanks to the benefits 
940
of the actions designed to optimise the existing financial structure. In addition, the 
positive market conditions and the greater net income from equity investments (€57 
million or +35.8%), thanks to the contribution of Senfluga, a company purchased 
in December 2018, and Teréga, contributed to achieving this result. These effects 
were partly absorbed by higher income taxes, -€16 million, mainly attributable to 
the greater pre-tax profit. Net financial debt was €11,923 million as at 31 December 
2019, compared with €11,548 million as at 31 December 2018.
Added Value produced and distributed
2017 2018 2019 For Snam, sustainability and creation of value are closely related concepts: 
sustainability creates value for the company and stakeholders, bringing together 
the business and social responsibility of the company. Through its activities, Snam 
produces wealth that contributes, directly and indirectly, to the economic growth 
of the context in which it operates. This wealth is often expressed in terms of 
Added Value produced and distributed to its reference stakeholders. 
Snam calculates the Added Value based on the standard prepared by the Gruppo 
di Studio per il Bilancio Sociale (GBS) (Sustainability Report Study Group) and GRI 
Standards, the national and international reference frameworks, respectively, for 
identifying and calculating the sustainability indicators of a business. Specifically, 
the GBS is an association dedicated to the development and promotion of 
scientific research into the Sustainability Report and issues relating to responsible 
management processes for businesses
The Added Value is calculated based on the values taken from the legally-required 
Income Statement, thereby becoming a useful tool for all stakeholders in 
understanding the economic impacts that the Group produces. In 2019, the gross 
global Added Value produced was €2,695 million, an increase of €163 million 
compared with 2018 (+ 6.4%).
