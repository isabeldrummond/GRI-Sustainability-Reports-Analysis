The involvement of Stakeholders
3 workshops organised for a total of  To get to know the point of view of its stakeholders directly, Snam conducted 
68 participants several workshops involving representatives from customers, suppliers and 
employees. During the meetings, after an introduction on Snam's position on 
5,460 online questionnaires sent with  the issue of sustainability, this was followed by a brief induction on the concept 
a participation rate of 39% of "materiality" and the analyses conducted to identify the relevant issues. Later 
on, the stakeholders were asked to validate the universe of issues and prioritise 
the themes by filling in a hard copy and online questionnaire. The results of the 
workshop, together with the preliminary analyses described above (trend, sector 
and benchmark), have made it possible to determine the external relevance of the 
sustainability issues.
This activity met with a very positive final judgement by the participants, who 
appreciated the involvement method and the issues discussed.
The joint analysis of the internal and external relevance led to the identification 
of the priority and materiality areas. The materiality matrix has been validated by 
the management, the ESG Committee and the CEO.
