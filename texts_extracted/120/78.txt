DEVELOPMENT OF SKILLS 
In order to preserve the important heritage of its technical know-how, to develop 
it and transfer it to the new generations, Snam established the Skill Centres, 
namely groups of people across the organisational structures with consolidated 
and recognised know-how and expertise in specific areas that are important 
for the business. The main objective of the project is to monitor, develop and 
disseminate corporate know-how also through innovative training activities and 
professional development. 
These centres are supported by an internal faculty of 80 employees who transfer 
their technical and business expertise to other colleagues through a "by Snam 
to Snam" approach. In 2019 the faculty provided around 1,200 teaching hours, 
contributing to the training of approximately 600 people.
