Customer satisfaction thermal year 2018-2019
The perceived quality of customers is constantly measured through customer 
satisfaction surveys.
In December 2019 a new online survey was conducted, involving all shippers and 
traders with whom Snam collaborated in the thermal year 2018-2019. 
The Survey, extended to transportation, storage and regasification activities, involved 
surveying the customer satisfaction on the quality of services offered, the customer 
engagement activities undertaken by the Company and on the functionality and 
additional services introduced in 2019 including in response to the needs of customer 
that emerged on previous occasions as well as regulatory developments.
The participation rate was 57% and the results were very positive with regard to 
the customer engagement activities implemented by Snam to improve the services 
offered and consolidate the collaboration with its stakeholders.
