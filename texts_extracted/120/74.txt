The absenteeism rate, which in 2019 stood at 4.5%, was essentially aligned to the 
previous years, does not include senior management and was calculated taking 
into consideration all hours not worked (paid and unpaid) excluding holidays, 
leaves and periods of mandatory and voluntary maternity leave. There were no 
essential changes between the absenteeism rate for men and women, which 
stood at 4.4% and 5,1%, respectively.
The turnover rate for 2019, remained consistent with the 2018 figure thanks to 
the hiring campaigns and the support of early retirement, as well as acquisitions 
completed during the year.
