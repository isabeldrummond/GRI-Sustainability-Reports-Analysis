“The Hydrogen Potential” study carried out with the analytical support of 
McKinsey, highlights how the difficulty of reducing emissions by 95% compared 
with 1990 is mainly due to the presence of so-called hard-to-abate sectors that 
cannot be totally decarbonised through the use of non-programmable electrical 
renewables, and which are currently responsible for 45% of domestic emissions. 
Hydrogen can be used in many of these sectors, for example as a fuel for heavy 
goods vehicles, for heating buildings or as feedstock for several industrial 
processes (e.g. steelworks, ammonia production). It can also offer flexibility 
services to the electrical system, through solutions such as Power to Gas that 
allows excess electricity to be converted into hydrogen, which is easier to store 
and transport, also exploiting some of the existing infrastructures. 
The “Hydrogen Potential” scenario estimates that by 2050 hydrogen could satisfy 
the 23% of the total energy demand for end users in Italy. According to this study, 
hydrogen would be increasingly more competitive compared with fossil fuels 
and other decarbonisation alternatives, especially in certain sectors such as, for 
example, transportation, heating and high-temperature industrial processes.
