achieving the challenging goals of 
reducing emissions in the long-term. Overall, Snam has set itself the target of reducing Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 
(indirect) CO equivalent emissions by 40% by 2030 (with a base of 2016), equal to 
2
around 1.5 million tonnes of CO equivalent, to fight climate change in line with 
2
global objectives. 
Specifically, Snam is committed to reducing its CH4 emissions by 40% by 2025 
(with a base of 2016) compared with the 25% target in the previous plan. This 
target will be achieved through the application of a campaign for identifying and 
repairing methane leaks (Leak Detection and Repair), the maximum replacement 
of network and power plant components and the adoption of the best 
technologies available.  
In addition, Snam is committed to a 40% reduction in direct CO emissions by 
2
2030 thanks to the launch of the conversion of six gas-electric hybrid power plants 
which will also contribute to the flexibility of the electric system and to energy 
efficiency actions at buildings. To achieve the overall target of 40%, Snam also 
plans a 40% reduction by 2030 of CO generated from electricity consumption

thanks to greater recourse to solar power.
