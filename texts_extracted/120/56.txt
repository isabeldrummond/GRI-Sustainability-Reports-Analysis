ENERGY CONSUMPTION
In 2019 the total energy consumption stood at 12,152 TJ (-8.5% compared with 
2018) in spite of an overall increase in the gas injected into the network (+3.5%).

The energy mix used by the Company is made up almost totally of natural gas 
(95.7% of the energy requirements). Other sources used are electricity (3.5%), other 
Natural gas  fuels (diesel, oil, LPG) and heat, which together represent the 0.8% of consumption. 
95.7%   Most of the Snam’s energy consumption is due to the gas turbines used in the 
compression systems which provide the pressure required for gas transportation 
on total energy mix used (thrust consumption) and to storage activities, which, overall, represent the 81% of 
total consumption, down by 88% from 2018.  
In 2019 there was an increase in the energy consumption for the gas regasification 
plant, equal to the 10% of the Group's total consumption (3.5% in 2018). This is due 
to the increase in the quantity of regasified gas (+170%).
