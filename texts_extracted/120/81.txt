In 2019, the second cycle of the Performance Management system was launched, 
which saw the expansion of the population involved to include all administrative 
staff on the headquarter (Corporate and Operations). As planned, in 2020, with 
the launch of the third cycle, the Performance Management system will involve 
the entire corporate population.

In 2019, the sustainability targets assigned were more than the previous year 
because there was a significant increase in the number of administrative staff 
within the scope of evaluation and the green business activities (Hydrogen, 
Biomethane, Biogas) were enhanced. These distinctive behaviours, included in the 
Performance Management system, demonstrate how the Company is integrating 
its sustainable business model with the promotion of virtuous behaviours.
