Support for parenting and work-life balance
Through incentives and benefits that go beyond the legally set limits, Snam 
supports its employees when they become parents and promotes a work/
life balance in the day by day activities. For this reason, employees retain their 
company benefits for the entire time they are on a maternity leave and, during 
the compulsory leave period, they receive the full amount of their pay rather 
than the legally-required 80% of it.
