The Materiality analysis
Every year Snam updates its materiality analysis in order to collect materiality 
issues or issues capable of reflecting the significant economic, environmental and 
social impacts of the company or which can substantially affect the evaluations and 
decisions of stakeholders. 
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the International Integrated Reporting 
Committee (IIRC) have repeatedly proposed materiality, and the analysis thereof, as 
a starting point necessary to bring reporting in line with stakeholder expectations. 
In this sense, Directive 2014/95/EU implemented in Italy through Legislative Decree 
254/2016, requires entities/companies, coming under the scope of the decree to 
apply this principle. 
Starting with the important issues that emerged last year, Snam has updated its 
materiality analysis by reworking the analysis of the sustainability context and 
scenario and repeating the prioritisation of issues for the organisation and its 
stakeholders. The directions provided by the Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB), for the Extractives & Minerals Processing: Oil & Gas midstream" were 
taken into consideration in defining the important issues.

most important issues from an external point of view, online surveys were
