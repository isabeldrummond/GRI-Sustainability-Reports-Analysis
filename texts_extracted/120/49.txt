The commitment to the 
Sustainable Development 
Goals
While pursuing its business model, Snam combines the commitment to issues 
deemed material by the Company and its stakeholders with a commitment to the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations in 2015, 
demonstrating its own contribution to the development of a sustainable economy 
and the society of the future.
The 17 SDGs and related targets are a systematisation of courses of action to 
follow for a more sustainable world and which cover all the macro-areas and 
modern macro-challenges, such as, for example, the fight against climate change, 
the defence of ecosystems and the battle against poverty. Among these, the 
Group has decided to concentrate its actions on several of these goals, developing 
those that are closest to the mission and activities of Snam, in such a way as to 
channel its commitment and maximise the results achieved.
