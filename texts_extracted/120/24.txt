Climate altering emissions are increasing, targets are not being met and there 
is an urgent need to redefine global policies to curb the consequences of 
climate change in the short, medium and long-term: this is the alarming scenario 
outlined in recent years which, at the same time, represents one of the greatest 
challenges in the history of humanity. 
To mitigate these effects it will be necessary to develop an economic system 
based on a progressive decarbonisation, gradually reducing the use of fossil 
fuels, starting with the most polluting, such as, for example, coal, focusing on 
the use of more efficient energy in order to curb consumption and promote the 
development and use of renewable and alternative energy sources.
For this reason, at the Paris Climate Conference (COP21) in December 2015, 195 
countries adopted the first universal and legally binding agreement on climate 
change at a global level. The agreement defines a global action plan to keep the 
average annual global temperature increase to within 1.5% compared with pre-
industrial levels. The European Union formally ratified the Paris Agreement of 
October 2016 and defined and expressed its commitment within the framework 
of the Clean energy for all Europeans Package by 2030 and the EU 2050 Climate 
Long-term Strategy, which aim not only to reduce CO emissions (-40% by 2030 
2
and -100% by 2050), but also increase the share of energy produced from 
renewable sources (+32% by 2030) and improve energy efficiency (+32.5% by 
2030).
