In order to expand the network of refuelling stations for vehicles running on 
natural gas, in 2019 the Company concluded an agreement with the IP Group for 
25 roadside and motorway stations. Through its subsidiary Snam4Mobility, since 
2017 it has signed agreements with various counterparties for the development 
of more than 100 refuelling stations, 11 of which are for LNG with compression 
systems for gas produced by the subsidiary Cubogas. Snam’s goal is to create over 
250 new distributors on a national scale, which will be part of the network already 
developed in Italy, to better balance the deployment in the different regions of 
the country.
The conversion of the company's fleet of vehicles to natural gas continued, 
increasing the number of new vehicles running on methane in 2019 by more than 
In 2019, Snam introduced

360  vehicles.
All motor vehicles purchased are defined as monofuel, which means that 
methane  the petrol tank is extremely small, with a capacity of only 9 litres. This was an 
important tool in the daily use of methane, in preference to petrol.
powered  In addition, a small refuelling station was installed by the subsidiary Cubogas 
in 2019 with a compressor for the company's methane vehicles at Snam's 
cars headquarters in San Donato Milanese and many more will follow at other 
 to its company  company premises throughout Italy.  This compressor comes under the category 
fleet,  to replace diesel ones of domestic systems, that allow the refuelling of vehicles directly, at home or 
at work. It involves reasonably small systems that are simple to install, that can 
be adapted to the low-pressure domestic gas network or the 220w electricity 
grid and are therefore ideal for refuelling the fleets of companies or small 
municipalities.
