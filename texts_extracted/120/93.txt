To evaluate the performance of suppliers, Snam uses a rating index (IR) that takes 
into consideration the compliance to the technical contractual requirements

sent to suppliers in the form of analytical ratings defined on the following

sharing the Snam's know-how and best practices along the entire supply chain.

to meet the agreed standards. Some examples could be a supplier failing to meet 
the technical-organisational requirements, a negative performance of  a supplier 
or its subcontractors, the non-compliance with the provisions on taxpaying and 
the rules of the Snam Code of Ethics. In 2019, 41 measures were adopted (+17%
