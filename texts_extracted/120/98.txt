In 2019, the allocations for storage capacities, like the transportation business, 
were incorporated in the European PRISMA platform. This synergy helps customer 
to use the sole platform for booking transportation and storage capacity and 
makes Snam's storage capacity more transparent at a European level. Thanks 
to Snam's ongoing commitment to meeting its customers different needs, 
the flexibility of the services offered, and constant, accurate information is 
guaranteed through dedicated studies.
