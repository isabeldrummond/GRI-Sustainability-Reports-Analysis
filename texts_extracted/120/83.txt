Alongside the consistent commitment through training, technological innovation 
and work organisation, the Snam4Safety project, launched in 2018 and continued 
in 2019, has made it possible to further strengthen the culture and awareness 
810 
about health and safety issues among employees and contract workers.
employees  
In order to raise awareness among employees on the issue of safety, in 2011 
rewarded  within the " Zero 
Snam established an initiative called the “Zero Accident Award”, which, based 
Accident Award" initiative on homogeneous teams according to employment/safety manager, rewards 
employees who go 365 consecutive days without an accident in the workplace. In 
2019 8 teams out of a total of 810 employees were rewarded.
Snam has also extended the awareness raising activities on health and safety 
outside of its corporate boundaries through the “Trofeo Sicurezza Appaltatori” 
(Contractors' Safety Prize), dedicated to contractors with the aim of focusing 
the attention of suppliers on these issues. Specifically, as part of this initiative, 
the performance of businesses is evaluated by collecting and analysing specific 
indicators (such as, for example, accident indices and negative feedback on topics 
of interest). In 2019, the Contractors Safety Prize (for results achieved in 2018) 
was awarded for the third year in a row to Max Streicher, a company specialised in 
the building of energy infrastructure, more specifically gas pipelines.
HEALTH PROTECTION
The health of workers who, depending on the task performed, are exposed to 
specific risk factors, is monitored through health surveillance activities carried 
out by dedicated health professionals. To guarantee a work environment that 
meets occupational hygiene standards, environmental surveys are periodically 
conducted aimed at monitoring micro-climate, biological and physical aspects 
of the locations. In addition, Snam absolutely prohibits the drinking of alcoholic 
beverages while at work. After a year in which no reports of any kind were 
received, one case of an occupational illness was reported in 2019 which is being 
investigated.
