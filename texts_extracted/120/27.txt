Also note that for both scenarios, the ambitious decarbonisation targets require 
the progressive penetration of increasing quantities of green gas in the Italian 
energy mix, leveraging biomethane, hydrogen and synthetic gases.  
The scenarios present different gas demand trends: increasing in the BAU scenario 
  compared with current demand – 73 billion m3 in 2018 – stable in the CEN 
scenario and decreasing in the PNIEC and the DEC scenarios. Both the DEC and 
CEN scenarios involve the European decarbonisation targets using increasingly 
more green gases in the Italian energy mix, relying on hydrogen, biomethane and 
synthetic methane. 
Specifically, it is estimated that in 2030 the demand for green gas will be 8.3 bcm 
in the CEN scenario and 3.7 bcm in the DEC scenario. By 2040 there is expected 
to be further growth in the demand for green gas, equal to 18.5 bcm in the 
CEN scenario and 13.2 bcm in the DEC scenario. Green gases will partly replace 
natural gas, not only in thermoelectric power plants, but also with end users: civil, 
industrial and transportation. 
 
To achieve the “zero emissions" target by 2050, in the context of economic 
growth of 1% of the GDP to 2050, Italy should make reductions equal to 420 Mt of 
CO equivalent (-95% compared with now).
