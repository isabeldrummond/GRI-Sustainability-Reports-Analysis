The Snam-Terna joint energy scenarios have made it possible to pool the 
specific expertise of the two operators, in the awareness that the interaction 
between scenarios in the electricity and gas sectors constitutes a new, very 
complex feature, both nationally and at EU level. The results collected in the 
Document Describing the Scenarios (DDS 2019), show how collaboration and 
the synergies between the electricity sector and the gas sector could be key in 
achieving the emission reduction targets. 
Specifically, the study conducted jointly by the two operators led to the 
development of three different scenarios: the Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario, 
the Centralized scenario (CEN), and the Decentralized scenario (DEC).
The BAU scenario features a technological mechanism for switching to more 
efficient technologies, guided purely by the market and a reduction in costs, and 
does not include reaching the European and national energy reduction targets.
The CEN and DEC development scenarios, on the other hand, represent a 
guide for defining a long-term business strategy aimed at decarbonisation. The 
two scenarios are rooted in the same macroeconomic context, with relatively 
sustained growth of 1.2% for the GDP per year and of the population (+2.4 
million inhabitants by 2040) and significant investment in energy efficiency and 
technological development. Both scenarios are driven by achieving the European 
emission reduction targets by 2030 and move forward on a path that allow to 
reach the long-term CO containment requirements laid down in the European 
2
Commission “2050 long term strategy “. Specifically, in the CEN scenario, the 
policy goals are reached thanks to curbing consumption and the development 
of renewable energies with significant availability of programmable renewable 
resources, such as green gases, leveraging the existing gas infrastructures, 
while the DEC scenario envisages the increased development of consumption 
electrification associated with the distribution of the generation distributed by 
non-programmable renewable energy sources.
