EMISSIONS TRADING SYSTEM (ETS) 
CO2 emissions   The carbon dioxide emissions of the Snam Group facilities subject to the ETS were 
from ETS plants (106t) overall greater than the emission shares allocated. The annual allocation of free 
allowances by the competent national authority gradually reduced over the years 
as set out from the third regulatory period in Article 10 bis of Directive 2009/29/
0.64 0.67 EC. In view of around 0.609 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted into the 
0.61
atmosphere, around 0.202 million tonnes were allocated free of charge, resulting 
in a 0.407 million tonne deficit. The allowances allocated also include those 
intended for the new gas compression plants of Minerbio and Sergnano in 2018 
0.25 and 2019.

Total NOx emissions (t) NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS
The use of natural gas as the main energy source allows sulphur oxides and 
564 particle emissions to be minimised compared to the use of other fossil fuels. Of 
532
these, the only significant emissions are those of nitrogen oxides (NOx) , that 
452 derive mainly from the combustion of natural gas in the gas turbines installed in 
the compression plants (thrust and storage). A programme was launched in recent 
years to curb these emissions by replacing traditional turbines with low emission 
turbines which, to date, account for almost all the turbines installed. Specifically, 
with the DLE turbine coming into operation in 2019 in the Minerbio storage plant 
as well, all the storage sites were operating with low emission units.
The reduction in energy consumption and the virtually total use of DLE turbines 
has led to a reduction in total nitrogen oxide emissions, in absolute terms of -20% 
compared to 2018 and a reduction in the ratio between nitrogen oxide emissions 
and energy use of 12%.

Average NOx emissions for the installed power of the storage machinery were 
further reduced by almost 30% going from 5.2 to 3.7 ([mg/Nm3]/MW) while those 
NOx emissions/energy used  for thrust remained unchanged, taking into account that they had already reached 
(kg/GJ) 3.8 ([mg/Nm3]/MW) last year.
