Management systems
The main objective of the management systems is to promote constant 
improvement in corporate performance relating to environment, health and safety 
and the quality of services provided and to guarantee regulatory compliance 
through the introduction and implementation of specific policies, organisational 
systems and programmes.
In 2019, Snam implemented all the necessary activities to extend the certification 
of the management systems to the new companies that entered the scope of 
consolidation and to maintain and update other existing certifications.
To check the effectiveness of the management systems, in 2019 227 audits were 
carried out at various group companies (92 of them by an external team) and 38 
audits at contractors working at sites, on health, safety and environment issues. 
The latter and the internal audits were partly carried out by the Snam internal 
team, composed of 47 auditors.
