The In-line gas recompression interventions, interventions with tapping machines, 
technology that makes it possible to disconnect pipelines in operation for new 
connections without an interruption to the service, and other initiatives have 
allowed Snam in 2019 to prevent the emission into the atmosphere of 9.4 million 
cubic metres of natural gas, equal to around 165,000 tonnes of CO  (+16%

compared with the figure of 142,000 tonnes of CO  in 2018).

As a confirmation of the benefit of the measures taken, emissions of methane per 
kilometre of network for the transportation activities fell further (-12% compared 
to 2018 and -15.4% compared to 2017).

The Company's performance indicators are in line with its methane emission 
reduction targets. Specifically, in 2019 Snam increased its reduction target for CH4 
emissions by 2025, from -25% in 2018 to -40%. The current situation is in line with 
this target (-19%).
Furthermore, in 2019 Snam recovered the 56% of natural gas emissions during 
maintenance activities, in line with its target of 33% per year by 2022.
