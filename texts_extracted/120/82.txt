HEALTH AND SAFETY 
Snam is committed to health and safety protection in the workplace through 
actions aimed at reducing risk factors. All corporate activities are governed by 
management systems with OHSAS 18001 certification on health and safety at 
work and the adoption of good practices, promoted and shared with suppliers, 
has, for some years, made it possible to keep accident rates down, for both 
employees and contractors.
In 2019 a total of 7 accidents took place, in line with 2018, 2 of which involved 
Snam Group employees (4 in 2018), both of which were in companies acquired 
last year (IES-Biogas and Cubogas) and 5 involved suppliers/contractors (3 in 
2018).
