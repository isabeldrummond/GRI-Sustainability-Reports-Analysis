 
CREATION OF A WALLPAINTING  
AT SECH
In  conjunction  with  the  celebration  of  the  world  day 
for health and safety at work, the new wallpainting was 
inaugurated, set up on the east wall of the pedestrian 
underpass connecting the two buildings at SECH terminal. 
The work, which completes the activity already carried out 
on the west side wall, consists of a wallpainting, conceived 
by Simona Piccardo, specialist student of the two-year 
course in Decoration from the Accademia Ligustica of 
Genoa and created directly by the students.
The project saw the collaboration of the students with 
the company RLS and the mural painting reproduces the 
container  as  context.  Within  the  pictorial  composition, 
graphic elaborations of safety signs have been included, 
as well as a large writing that refers to the concept of 
safety and attention. The composition follows the world of 
neo-pop culture, with references to the graphics of the first 
computers. This is the second pictorial intervention carried 
out by the students and an explanatory brochure was 
distributed to all workers.
