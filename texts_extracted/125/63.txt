In this sense, it is confirmed that the goal for the years to come remains to consolidate 
the target achieved both in terms of effective absenteeism and accident performance.
Please also find the contents of SECH supplementary company agreement, which 
provides:
• A productivity bonus, paid only for the hours of effective attendance at work;
• a professionalism award, granted only to those who work at least 50% of the hours 
that may be worked;
• a premium linked to effective presence, which provides for the payment of an 
additional amount with respect to normal wage, for each shift/day of effective 
presence at work;
• the recognition of additional leave permits, in the case of zero incidence of injuries 
during the year.
Following the tragedy of the collapse of the Morandi bridge and the consequent 
serious difficulties for many commuters in being able to reach their workplace, and 
taking into account the absence of a public service inside the east side port that could 
allow the movement of staff operating there in safety conditions, the company has set 
up a shuttle bus service (from Monday to Friday) to help employees who, being unable 
to use their own car anymore, must reach their workplace by public transportation.
With  the  intention  of  concretely  adopting  measures  aimed  at  promoting  flexible 
articulation in times and places of subordinate work (according to the dictates of 
law 81 dated May 2017), for the first time in its history, SECH in 2018 has introduced 
the possibility of carrying out one’s own work performance according to the modality 
called “telecommuting” (smart working), thus formalising an agreement with a worker, 
with another worker joining in 2019.
In terms of total remuneration, i.e. including all the elements of value (salary, benefits, 
bonuses etc.) that the employees receive in exchange for their work in the company, 
the ratio between the remuneration of the highest paid individual in the organisation 
(excluding the managers) compared to the average remuneration of all employees 
(the highest paid excluded) is 1.53 for SECH and 1.9 for TDT.
To a ratio such as the one mentioned above, the value, although high in Leghorn, 
denotes the sensitivity of the organisation to individual enhancement, as there is a 
relationship between the accrued and the amount due which, as in 2018, also in 2019 
maintains the gap between the two genders with a rather low differential.
