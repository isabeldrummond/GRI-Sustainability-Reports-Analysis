HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM

The choice of SECH and TDT to structu-
re their management systems with a 
view to CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT 
highlights  the  importance  assigned 
not only to the quality of the services 
provided,  therefore  to  the  attention 
paid to customer needs, but also to the 
respect for the environment and the pro- DO
CHECK
tection  of  all  operators.  In  this  context, 
both terminals pursue, with the utmost com-
mitment,  the  objective  of  guaranteeing  and 
continuously improving their health and safety per-
formance and, for this reason, in 2019 they completed, on a voluntary 
basis, the transition from the BS OHSAS 18001:2007 standard to the new 
standard, obtaining the UNI ISO 45001:2018 certification. The transition 
was completed after an in-depth analysis of the context in which the organisations 
operate, which entailed the identification of internal and external factors, health and 
safety requirements at work by all the parties concerned and the mapping of business 
scenarios, with the attribution of risk and opportunity values f  or each of them, accor-
ding to a defined criterion that associates the probability of occurrence with the extent 
of the consequences. In particular, the suitability of the interventions implemented by 
the companies to align the risks that emerged to the acceptable threshold was veri-
fied, also defining corporate objectives and improvement actions, aimed at further re-
ducing the risks and seizing new opportunities.

 THE ADOPTION OF SAFE BEHAVIOUR MEANS HAVING ACQUIRED A CULTURE OF 
SAFETY, SINCE IT MUST NOT BE EXPERIENCED AS A BOND, AN OBLIGATION, BUT AS A 
VALUE, AS IS LIFE, WHICH WE MUST PRESERVE AND RESPECT.
