The implementation of these purposes passes through the definition and 
implementation of specific management procedures, the provision of 
training to personnel, the daily control of compliance with the provisions, 
the definition and monitoring of improvement objectives, the use of tools 
that allow the control of legislative compliance and the management, 
also through the use of specific software, of non-compliance with the 
respective corrective and improvement actions.
Furthermore,  the  qualification  and  awareness  of  suppliers  and 
contractors, who operate within the terminals, are bearers of indirect 
impacts.  They  are  therefore  requested,  also  through  environmental 
requirements included in contracts, compliance with current legislation 
and internal procedures, as well as the adoption of working standards.
Since 2011, the adoption of the organisational and management model 
(MoG) pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001, which includes in its field 
of application the prevention of certain types of environmental crimes, 
represents for SECH and TDT an additional guarantee and control system 
for compliance with the current legislation.
In particular, since 2009, TDT guarantees the controlled management of 
environmental aspects and the improvement of its performance through 
the  adoption  of  an  environmental  management  system  certified 
according to the UNI EN ISO 14001:2015 standard and annually verified 
by an external accredited certification body. The environmental analysis 
of TDT also analyses the aspects along all the processes and activities
