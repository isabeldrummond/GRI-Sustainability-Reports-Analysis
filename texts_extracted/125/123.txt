environmental  management  system,  numerous  and  diversified 
improvement actions were carried out, involving transversally all terminal 
sectors, as shown below:
• Energy consumption: after a series of technical-economic feasibility 
assessments on the possibility and convenience of installing wind or 
photovoltaic systems, it was currently decided to proceed with the 
following actions:
» 
Certified energy supply from certified renewable sources;
» 
installation of twilight lights for external office lighting;
» 
installation of presence sensors in office bathrooms;
» 
installation of sensors for reefer units lighting only in case of need;
» 
replacement in 2010 of 75 neon lamps with 75 dimmed neon 
lights, with a verified saving of 42-46%; the return on investment was 
achieved in about 5 years;
» 
replacement of some more ancient operating means;
» 
replacement of lights in the forecourt towers with LED projectors in 
2018, with a verified saving of over 50%; the return on investment 
was achieved in approximately 2.6 years;
» 
replacement in 2019 of the lights of two cranes with LED lights;
• dusts: the Port System Authority intervenes for the reduction of dust in 
case of transfer of sludge to/from the filling tank with daily sweeping 
and street washing in the summer; TDT sweeps yards 3 times a week;

• spills: Numerous corrective actions were carried out to reduce the 
causes  of  some  recurring  events  (defective  o-rings34  non-original 
pipes, non-functioning overflow systems, non-functioning auto shut-

replacement of 3 vehicles was registered;
• raw materials: raw materials: The purchase of printing and hygiene 
paper, preferably recycled or non-chlorinated FSC 35 was approved; 
34. O-ring: it is an elastomer ring, with a circular section used as a mechanical seal. The o-rings are 
designed to be inserted in special housings and be compressed during the assembly of two or more 
parts, thus creating a sealing gasket.. 
35. FSC: The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is a non-profit international NGO that has created an 
internationally recognised forest certification system. The purpose of the certification is the correct 
forest management and the traceability of the derived products and the FSC logo guarantees that 
the product was made with raw materials deriving from forests correctly managed according to the 
principles of the two main standards: Forest management and chain of custody.
