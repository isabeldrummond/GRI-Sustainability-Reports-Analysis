Human resources are an essential business asset; their growth is a 
fundamental and essential factor for the development of both terminals.
The research and selection process aims to ensure the two companies 
the necessary skills to offer a quality service to customers: it is managed 
by  the  HR  department,  which  also  oversees  relations  with  schools, 
universities and employment centres.
The search and selection methods used by the companies comply with 
the principles of the Code of Ethics adopted both by SECH and TDT, as 
well as of the labour law, the national collective labour agreements (i.e. 
ports and managers of industrial companies national agreements) 
in all their disciplined institutions and in strict compliance with the 
requirements established by law.
The policy of both companies guarantees equal opportunities for men 
and women in accessing employment, without any discrimination on 
grounds of sex, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, political opinions, 
sexual  orientation,  personal  and  social  conditions,  in  line  with  the 
applicable legislation and, in particular, with the equal opportunities 
code (Legislative Decree 198/06).
Human resources are hired solely on the basis of regular employment contracts, no 
form of irregular employment being tolerated, neither for Italian citizens nor foreigners. 
The candidate must be made aware of all the features relevant to the employment 
relationship.
The recognition of salary increases or other incentive instruments and access to higher 
roles and assignments (promotions) are linked, in addition to the rules established by 
the law and by the sector collective employment contract, to the individual merits of 
the workers, among which are the ability to express organisational behaviours and
