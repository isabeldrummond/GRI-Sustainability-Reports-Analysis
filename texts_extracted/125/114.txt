5.1.8 Light emissions
At SECH the prevailing light emissions are made up of light towers, quay 
cranes and yard RMGs. Specifically, 22 floodlights are mounted on the 
quay cranes:
• Under the trolley, 235W LED with diffused light;
• 7 x 1000W traditional sodium vapour fixed beam (SON-T);
• 5 x 1000W traditional sodium vapour moving beam (SON-T);
• 4 x 145W LED on the lower cross beams of the prime movers for street 
lighting;
• 78 x 455W LED floodlights are set up on the 9 lighting towers, while two 
still remain with traditional 1000W SON-T floodlights, 18 in all;
• on the RMGs there are 20 new projectors on each crane, which 
absorb a power of 138W.
To these must be added, as regards the external light emissions, the 
10x145W LED floodlights on the roof of the administrative building and 
the 16x120W plus 4x145W of the company parking lot.
At Terminal Darsena Toscana the light emission sources are represented 
by 33 lighting towers and by the night lighting of the cranes, provided 
for safety reasons to guarantee work during the night hours and for 
signalling the area next to the flight corridor of the landing aircrafts at the 
nearby city of Pisa.

All the lights are turned on and off by means of a twilight switch.
The lighting towers are located along the road that leads to the terminal as well as 
inside the yard area and are distributed as follows:

The replacement of the sodium vapour lamps with LED took place in 2018 on all the  VIR
N
tallest towers, while the ones on the five of the railway connection and on two cranes  E
were replaced in 2019.
In both terminals the intensity was adjusted according to the minimum requirements 
for ground lighting in port areas provided by the various UNI standards (for example 
UNI EN 12464), while the orientation was kept downwards, with a structure of protection 
over each crown of headlights, to avoid dispersion and therefore light pollution. During 
routine maintenance, the correct orientation of the lamps is assessed.
