In fact, instability pervaded the first quarter of the year: if January ended with an at least 
encouraging result, the signs on the volume trend were, on the contrary, discouraging 
in February, closed with just over 13,500 movements.
It must be said that in January, with 16,347 movements recorded, the last vessel of 
the MGX service was operated before its migration to another Genoese terminal; in 
addition, the MD1 service increased its volume contribution, recording around 4,000 
movements during the month in the new configuration, whereas in its old structure, the 
maximum monthly peak scored around 2,300 containers.
Also in the second half of the year the trend remained almost unchanged: THE Alliance 
kept the volumes of the MD1 service operated at the terminal practically unchanged, 
compared to the previous three months and significantly at lower rates than the 
levels declared by the lines belonging to the alliance and this despite the increase 
in capacity through the renewed use of larger vessels (14,000 TEUs), as well as the 
consequent increase in allocations. Furthermore, the persistent difficulties encountered 
in the previous ports have continued to contribute to making the service less punctual 
and reliable.
In fact, there have been several omissions and cancellations at Genoa, both for this 
service as well as for the western leg (IMW) of the IMEX service: after a March on hold 
- with a cancellation on the IMW service and a total movement of just under 16,000 
units - and a dramatic April - with four calls canceled (3 IMW, 1 MD1) and a total of just 
12,800 movements - only in May the volumes lost in the previous months were partially 
recovered and, despite two other cancellations (1 IMW, 1 MD1), the ceiling of 21,000 
movements was reached and exceeded, i.e. the highest level of movement achieved 
by the terminal in 2019.
However, these volumes were not destined to be replicated in the third quarter: after 
the months of June and July, where more than 17,000 and 19,000 movements were
