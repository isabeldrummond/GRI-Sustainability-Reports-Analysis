The above rates follow the below calculation methods, consistent with what is indicated 
by the GRI Guidelines:
• Incidence Rate20:  
(n° injuries*1.000/n° workers);
• Frequency Rate21:  
(total injuries/total worked hours)*1.000.000;
• Severity Rate: 
 (total lost days/total worked hours)*1.00022;
• Average Duration:  
(n° absence days due to injury/n° of injuries).
19. Data processed on 18/09/2019, when the last injury of 2018 was officially closed.
20. Starting from 2018 Sustainability Report, this index was calculated using a multiplier of 1.000 instead 
of 100, to obtain a value aligned with the parameters of the law, rather than a figure that until now was 
considered more representative compared to the size of SECH.
21. Starting from 2018 Sustainability Report, this index was calculated using a multiplier of 1.000.000 
instead of 100.000, to obtain a value aligned with the parameters of the law, rather than a figure that 
until now was considered more representative compared to the size of SECH.
22. Compared to other indicators, this index is calculated using a multiplier of 1.000 to obtain a 
representative value compared to SECH dimensions.
