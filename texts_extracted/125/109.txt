5.1.6.2 CONVEYED EMISSIONS 
The conveyed emissions inside the terminals are represented by:
• Hot water heater emissions;
• emissions from welding activities (from mechanical maintenance 
activities at SECH - internal - and at TDT - contracted), regulated by 
the provisions of art. 272 Legislative Decree 152/2006 and Regional 
Deliberation 1260/2010 (SECH only);
• emissions from mechanical metalworking and/or surface treatments 
and/or other metalworking (from mechanical maintenance activities 
at SECH - internal - and at TDT - contracted), regulated by the provisions 
of art. 272 Legislative Decree 152/2006 and Regional Deliberation 
1260/2010 (SECH only).
Conveyed emissions are due to thermal plants. Emissions in abnormal or 
emergency conditions of the air conditioning systems add also up to these ones.
The thermal power plants, both at SECH and at TDT, are used for the heating of sanitary 
water in the changing rooms27, whereas the heating of the offices is guaranteed by 
a system of heat pumps, used in air conditioning mode in the summer season. This 
solution significantly reduces the consumption of traditional fuels (diesel or natural 
gas), as well as emissions, however it must be kept under control due to the presence

dated 25/11/1994, was taken as reference.
27. At SECH the thermal power plant is also functional for the heating of the same and of the two offices 
of the maintenance department.
