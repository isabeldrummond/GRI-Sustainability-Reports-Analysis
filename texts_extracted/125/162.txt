EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
In the field of emergency management, in addition to the exercises carried out in 
application of the safety regulations and the requirements of the health and safety 
management system, TDT organised an emergency exercise with recovery of the 
operator from the quayside crane, with the participation of the local fire brigade 
command.
The exercise allowed to test one of the most difficult and proper management scenarios, 
to improve relations with the authorities in charge and to identify opportunities for 
improvement in emergency management.
In addition, in 2019, on the initiative of the prevention and protection service, TDT 
purchased and donated two 20-foot containers free of charge to the provincial 
command of the Leghorn fire brigade, to be assigned to the institutional service carried 
out by the national fire brigade.
The containers will be used as storage for equipment, for logistics and operations on 
the territory as well as to simulate emergency interventions.
