5.1.5.1 SECH NOISE EMISSIONS
 The acoustic emissions contribution of SECH activities is mainly due to 
the handling and storage operations of the containers, as well as the 
mechanical workshop. Loading and unloading activities are carried out 
both during the day and at night, while workshop activities take place 
mainly during the day. The municipality of Genoa classified the municipal 
territory according to the criteria set by art. 4, paragraph 1, letter a) of 
Law 26/10/1995, n. 447, and the same was approved by the province of 
Genoa on 21/11/2001. On the basis of the acoustic classification of the 
territory of the municipality of Genoa, the area concerned falls into class 
VI “zones belonging to transport infrastructures”, with emission and input 
limits, provided for by the Ministerial Decree dated 14/11/1997, equal to 
65 dB (A) for emissions and 70 dB (A) for inputs, both day and night. The 
neighbouring areas belong to Class V (Lanterna) and Class IV (ferry 
terminal). Since it is a port area, there are no residential receptors.
The auditing of daytime noise made by a specialised company during 
2016 showed that the activity does not exceed the limit values set 
forth. Below are the location of the measurement points and the data 
collected.
