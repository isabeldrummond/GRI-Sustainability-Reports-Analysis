6.7.1 Injuries at work
The adoption by SECH and TDT of health and safety of workers’ schemes 
according  to  the  UNI  ISO  45001:2018  standard  guarantees  the 
management of anomalies detected according to an internationally 
recognised standard.
Following to the occurrence of injuries, in particular, the terminals react 
immediately by initiating in-depth investigation activities, necessary to 
ensure a timely reconstruction of the dynamics of the events. The analysis 
of the data and the testimonies collected allow the identification of 
the  root  causes  underlying  the  occurrence  of  the  events  and  the 
determination of the actions to be implemented, to avoid recurrence 
of the event as well as improve health and safety conditions of the 
workplace.
Below are the figures relating to the trends of SECH and TDT.
