of which represented by the entry into force of the new international  MP

legislation wanted by the IMO (International Maritime Organisation),  C
E 
which imposes a limit of 0.5% on the sulfur emissions generated by  H
T
maritime transport. The low availability and high prices of low sulfur fuel 
has prompted companies to focus on the best alternative choice, namely 
the exhaust fumes purifiers, the so-called scrubbers, both expensive and 
not very in line with the trend towards sustainability of the last times. It 
has been and will still be very difficult for shipping companies to be 
able to move all the extra costs associated with the sulfur cap to their 
customers. This is because, in the extremely competitive environment in 
which the carriers operate, the composition of the maritime freight (and 
land freight, with door-door prices) becomes a lump sum, in which the 
additional ones disappear or are subject to commercial negotiation.
This  has  led  once  again  to  favour  first  the  processes  of  horizontal 
concentration between lines of similar dimensions, subsequently - once 
the benefits of scale for this type of operations have been exhausted 
- the carriers have aimed to generate new cash flows, making vertical 
integrations in land and port logistics, which is believed to have higher 
margins.
In 2019, then, the ongoing vessel upsizing is yet another aspect that one 
can’t help focussing on. It is a fact that from a double error of shipowners 
evaluation an unnecessary race to build ever larger ships was born. The 
first fault was an economic one. Simplifying, it was believed that China 
would maintain high growth rates for a long time on exports. On the contrary, the 
slowdown was significant, with the country’s repositioning on internal consumption. 
The second mistake was commercial. Those who started building the first 18-20,000-TEU 
ships believed that competition would not follow suit, but it did.
The result was unsustainable for the individual companies, nonetheless the investments 
were maintained through the creation of operational alliances, which ended up 
exerting enormous infrastructural pressure not only on ports, but also on the public 
entities in charge of the tasks of port and control activities.1
