The reduction in total emissions is also due in TDT to energy efficiency actions. The fact 
that electricity is 100% from renewable sources and not only 43% is not quantified.
Both terminals also conducted an environmental survey aimed at portraying the air 
quality in terms of concentration of dust, volatile organic compounds and combustion 
fumes,  conducted  during  normal  terminal  activities,  in  order  to  evaluate  worker 
exposure to the various chemical compounds deriving from the emissions produced 
by the combustion exhausts of the terminal operating vehicles, from the degradation 
of the road surface and tire consumption, from the fumes coming from the vessels at 
berth and from the filling tanks.
Below is the list of agents considered:
Y
• Carbon monoxide (CO); BILIT
A
• particulate (PM ); AIN

• breathable dust; AL S

• nitrogen dioxide (NO ); ME

The deviation from the TLV (Threshold Limit Value24) of the various substances being 
evaluated was assessed and, as regards the gases, the verification to show how many 
times the value equal to one tenth of the TLV was exceeded during sampling was 
carried out. For the dusts the results obtained were compared with the reference values 
(the TLV as regards breathable dusts and the limits referred to urban areas as per 
Ministerial Decree dated 25/11/1994 concerning PM ). The following table summarises

the reference values on which the assessments were based:
23. Considered in the total amount.
24.  They  refer  to  the  environmental  concentrations  of  airborne  chemicals  and  indicate  the 
concentrations below which it is believed that most workers can be exposed repeatedly day after day, 
for a working life, without adverse health effects.
