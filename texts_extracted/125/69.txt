With particular reference to the figures of the first management line, it is evident that 
these come entirely from the local context for both companies.
For both terminals, taking on positions of responsibility represents the natural passage 
for an internal professional path, thanks to which the employee develops a strong 
sense of identity and belonging to the company. Great importance is attached to this 
aspect, defining individual career paths and targeted ad hoc development plans, 
allowing people to be able to fill roles of ever greater responsibility.
Besides its employees, SECH avails itself of the services of the Dockers company 
(CULMV) and TDT of the Leghorn Port Employment Agency (CILP), i.e. the only subjects 
authorised to supply labour pursuant to art. 17 law 84/94.
