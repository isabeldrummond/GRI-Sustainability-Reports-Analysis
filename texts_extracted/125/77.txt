5.1.1.1 ENERGY RESOURCES
Energy consumption is due to:
• Temperature-controlled containers (reefer) plugging;
• use of quay cranes/RMGs 1;
• use of rolling stock (RTGs 2, forklifts, prime movers, reachstackers);
• yard lighting;
• office activities;
• ancillary activities.
At the moment, internal metres are not installed at SECH, which allow for 
the reporting of electricity consumption divided by type of equipment; 
based on the nominal power, it is however possible to estimate the 
energy absorption of the different equipment. In TDT, on the other hand, 
there are partialised metres that have been made legible and remotely 
monitored since 2018 (SCADA project).
Below is the breakdown of energy consumption.
At SECH, 57% of energy needs are covered by diesel, 40% by electricity and 3% by 
methane (used only to heat sanitary waters). Compared to 2018, there was a slight 
increase in the supply of methane. The total committed electrical power grew by 8% 
compared to 2018, due to the addition/modernisation of the lighting towers and 
columns for the temperature-controlled containers’ power supply. Shore cranes (41%) 
and RMGs (31%) are always the topmost users. Considerable, and growing compared 
to 2018, the electricity from reefer containers plugging (from 17% to 23%).
