6.8 DANGEROUS GOODS MANAGEMENT
Regarding  the  management  of  dangerous  goods,  SECH  and  TDT 
guarantee compliance with national and international regulations and 
with  recommendations  issued  by  the  IMO  in  the  “Revised 
Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Cargoes and 
Related Activities in Port Areas”. In order to allow the segregation of units, 
SECH and TDT have dedicated stacking areas for the storage of containers used for the 
transport of dangerous goods (IMO).
Within these areas dedicated to the storage of dangerous goods, the containers must be 
positioned in compliance with the relevant hazard classes and segregation constraints, 
imposed for reasons of compatibility between the different materials stored in the containers. 
Dangerous goods belonging to the following hazard classes are excluded from storage: 
class 1 (except class 1.4 S), class 6.2 and class 7, which can be accepted only with the 
prior authorisation of the authorities, based on the provisions of legal requirements.
The  procedures  require  that  the  structure  of  the  IMO  storage  areas,  the  correct 
segregation and the presence of any anomalies are constantly monitored. The presence 
of dangerous goods within a temporary port depot is, in fact, subject to continuous 
changes, being constantly influenced by the handling (loading/unloading, receiving/
delivery) activity that takes place within its areas. Therefore, the risk analysis is dynamic 
and is managed through a dedicated software, Hacpack, which is used in many other 
Italian terminals and allows to constantly assess the risk based on the type of goods, the 
hazard class, the packaging, the weight of each single package and the total weight 
of the containers in the dedicated stacking area. Furthermore, the software is also able 
to provide in real time the safety data sheets of the goods extant in the storage area 
to allow a rapid and correct management of any emergency interventions, both for 
environmental and health as well as safety aspects for workers. Furthermore, SECH 
and TDT set up specific monitoring procedures and systems in order to guarantee the 
management of dangerous goods and the response to emergencies. In this regard, 
the Terminals ensure specific training of all employees, as well as information to all third-

party personnel accessing their areas, about the existent risks, the behaviours to be 
held and the emergency procedures adopted.

weight or volume of the substances handled.
28. CSC: out-of-vessel cycle truck/truck; NSN: transshipment; TSC: out-of-vessel cycle rail/truck. For TDT 
the value is relevant only to the NSN (transshipment) movements; CSC and TSC are equal to 0.
