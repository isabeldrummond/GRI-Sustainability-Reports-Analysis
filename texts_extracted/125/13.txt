Gruppo  Investimenti  Portuali  has  therefore  adopted  a  set  of  rules,

procedures  and  organisational  structures  aimed  at  allowing  the 
identification,  measurement,  management  and  monitoring  of  the 
main risks, also determining their degree of acceptability through a 
management consistent with the strategic objectives identified.
The architecture of the internal control and management system of SECH 
and TDT is based on the following principles:
• Separation of roles and duties, the aim of which is to reduce the risk of 
fraud and errors, and is achieved through the division of the activities/
responsibilities  relating  to  a  specific  business  process  between 
different functions/individuals;
• the accountability of information and processes, understood as the 
attribution of responsibility to a subject (or group of subjects);
• traceability of data and information.
All this has been translated into an integrated management system 
compliant with the UNI EN ISO 9001:2015 (quality management system), 
UNI ISO 45001:2018 (health and safety management system) and UNI 
ISO 37001:2016 standards (anti-corruption management system).
In 2019, in particular, the terminals adopted the management system 
on a voluntary basis, compliant with the international standard UNI 
ISO  45001:2018.  Adherence  to  this  standard  allows,  with  a  view  to 
continuous improvement, to identify, adopt, monitor and possibly modify 
the measures necessary to organise and prepare healthy and safe

workplaces, prevent work-related injuries and diseases and continuously 
improve health and safety benefits.
Following  to  the  transition  from  BS  OHSAS  18001:2007  to  UNI  ISO 
45001:2018, SECH and TDT have implemented a new risk and opportunity

aspects and impacts. During 2019 SECH and TDT obtained the UNI ISO 
45001:2018 certification.
