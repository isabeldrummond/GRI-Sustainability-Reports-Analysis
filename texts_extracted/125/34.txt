SECH and TDT are also associated with Assiterminal, the Italian Port  US
S
Terminal Association, which has the primary objective of guaranteeing 
the direct representation of the associated port entrepreneurship, as well 
as of contributing to the formation of policies regarding the procedures 
and development of port terminal activities and, more generally, of the 
national logistics system. In particular, it pursues, among its purposes, the 
representation in relations with the administrative and political authorities 
to protect the category interests and provides advice and information on 
issues and problems of relevance for the sector.
Assiterminal has followed and managed some tax issues, such as the 
ART contribution and the IMU municipal tax.
The economic effects of SECH- and TDT’s activities do not anyway end in 
the production of added value: in fact, aspects such as job creation in 
the reference territory - from which almost all company employees come 
from - and the selection of suppliers located in the Genoa and Leghorn 
contexts must be considered.
