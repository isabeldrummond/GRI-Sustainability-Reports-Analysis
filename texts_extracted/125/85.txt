At TDT the water supply is guaranteed by the port aqueduct, whose operator carries 
out the ordinary and extraordinary maintenance of the water supply and distribution 
systems in the port area. The supply is purely potable water, as there is no availability 
of, and connection to, the industrial water network. The water withdrawn is used for civil 
uses, such as toilets and showers, the power supply of the fire prevention system, the 
washing of vehicles.
Water consumption is monitored by reading the metres compared with the consumption 
reported on the invoice. Over the years, consumption anomalies have been analysed 
and managed by metre breakage, extra withdrawals (e.g. extraordinary supply of 
water to the Port Authority System), network leaks, sporadic services such as washing 
the cold rooms.
As per the table below, the most significant consumption is that relating to offices and 
bathrooms: over the years, efforts have been made to reduce consumption by applying 
flow reducers in the showers, with results that are not very appreciable as yet, as shown 
by the normalised indicator on the hours worked. In 2019, a repaired underground 
water leak was detected, bringing the piping overground for a faster identification of 
potential failures in the future.
