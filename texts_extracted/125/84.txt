supplier for subsequent reuse, plus each employee received a “designer” bottle. For 
personnel working at yard and in the workshop, plastic water bottles at SECH have been 
replaced by biodegradable ecological plastic bottles. The action will make it possible to 
decrease the production of plastic waste by around 120.000 bottles per year.

As far as the water supply at SECH terminal is concerned, there is a  ME

contract, for industrial use, with the company running the ordinary and  O

extraordinary maintenance of the supply network. The metres located in  N
E
the SECH concession area are four, two for civil users and two for the 
firefighting network, one of which is dedicated to dangerous goods. The 
water withdrawn for civil use is utilised for toilets, showers and vehicle 
washing.
Water consumption is monitored at SECH since 2018 through a direct 
reading of the four metres, performed quarterly by the HSSE workers 
and compared with what invoiced from the supplier. Any anomaly or 
discrepancy is promptly reported to verify the cause.
The greatest water withdrawal refers to the two buildings, where the 
changing  rooms  also  reside.  Consumption  during  2019  increased 
significantly following a hidden leak in the section of pipe that feeds the 
washbasins of a changing room. The underground line was intercepted 
upstream and bypassed externally in November 2019.
