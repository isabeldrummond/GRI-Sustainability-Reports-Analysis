actually hides a great volatility, made of blank sailings on the Med/
Middle East line, of spot vessels, especially in the second half of the year, 
and services that left the terminal (e.g. MD1) on short notice.
The  excess  of  terminal  offers  in  the  Genoese  area,  combined  with 
aggressive commercial policies of competitors, penalised the terminal, 
whose service in any case continues to be considered of excellent 
quality, as evidenced by the high number of spot vessels calling at the 
terminal for issues generated in other structures.
During 2019, various operations were then completed, including those of 
the maintenance dredging in the area in front of the quay, so that the 
14,000-TEU vessels can therefore be operated with even greater safety. In 
addition, at the end of the year, the construction of the new PIF (Border 
Inspection Point) was completed, a cutting-edge construction for the old 
port basin, which will be operational in the second half of 2020.
