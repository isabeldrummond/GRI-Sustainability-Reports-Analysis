5.1 DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
The direct environmental impacts derive from ship/rail/truck unloading and loading 
activities and from upstream and downstream accessory ones.
They are flanked by indirect environmental impacts, connected to the activities of 
internal and external suppliers and customers and on which the terminals have an 
indirect and variable power of intervention.
In light of the above, we can consider the following significant direct environmental 
aspects related to the terminal activity:
• Resource consumption;
• water discharge;
• waste production;
• discharges to the ground;
• noise emissions;
• emissions in the atmosphere:
» 
diffuse emissions;
» 
conveyed emissions;
• electromagnetic emissions;
• light emissions;
• visual impacts;
• ionising radiations;
Y
• odorous emissions. BILIT

It should be recalled in this regard that the terminals are not subject to the constraints  AL S
deriving from the Kyoto Protocol or to emission trading schemes. NT

5.1.1 Resource consumption
The resources mainly consumed within the terminals are:
• Energy resources;
• water;
• material derived from raw materials of various kinds (e.g. paper, office equipment, 
installations, etc.).
