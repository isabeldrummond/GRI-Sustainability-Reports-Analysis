achieved respectively, also thanks to the calls of two spot vessels of the former AL6 
service, there was a sudden drop in August, the month in which two cancellations and 
even two blank sailings occurred, on the IMEX and MD1 services. These losses were in 
fact only partially offset by a call from the IME service, which made both loading and 
discharge operations, as well as a spot call from a vessel of the MGX service operated 
by Hapag Lloyd, normally operated at another Genoese terminal. The final result for the 
month of August reached therefore just 14,000 movements.

Besides, in the last quarter of the year there were other changes following to the  NI

migration of the MD1 service to another Genoese terminal, implemented with only one  MP

week’s notice and with the last vessel of the service operated at SECH at the beginning  C

of the month of October.  H

Despite the situation in which THEA left the terminal - that is, in the total impossibility of 
timely designing a new action plan, given the absolutely incongruous times with which 
the notice concerning the cancellation of the service was received - the months of 
October and November were closed with approximately 15,200 and 13,000 movements 
respectively.
These are not comforting numbers when viewed in absolute terms, however it must be 
taken into account that the terminal is operating only two ocean services (IMEX and 
ME2), in addition to the feeder and the irregular MedCan service operated by Melfi 
Marine; in addition, the loss of the MD1 service alone led to a decrease in volumes in 
the order of approximately 4,000 movements per month, on average.
It should be mentioned that the numbers indicated above were also achieved thanks 
to the handling of five spot vessels in the months of October and November and four in 
the first half of December, allowing in part to offset the loss of the MD1 service: namely, 
one MGX vessel, four of MSC's Turkey-Canada service for which the reference terminal 
had difficulty managing the reefer load, two of the Bossanova service operated by 
Maersk and CMA and two, ironically, of the MD1 service, which served, however, to 
compensate for the cancellation of the ME2 service operated by Maersk in week 50 for 
delays accumulated in previous ports.
The latter ships were worked at our terminal due to the difficulties encountered in the 
city’s west side terminals in the management of traffic, after the total closure of the two 
main motorways, which add to some difficulties already existing on another big artery; 
this following the tragic and unfortunately well-known events creating hydrogeological 
instability that occurred during the red alert at the end of November 2019.
