The contents of the report and the level of detail have thence been defined by SECH 
and TDT considering:
• The expectations and interests of the Stakeholders: the report is addressed to all the 
parties involved in the terminal activities, a preventive assessment was therefore carried 
out, identifying the Stakeholders and their interests, in order to consistently define the 
reporting of the indicators required by the GRI, selected on the basis of their relevance 
to the terminal activity and their information capacity towards the Stakeholders;
• the context of sustainability and the relationships between sustainability and the 
organisations’ strategy: in the discussion of the topics SECH and TDT exposed their 
understanding of sustainable development and the connections with the business 
strategy, explaining how the organisations contribute, or aim at contributing in the 
future, to the improvement or worsening of conditions, developments and economic, 
environmental and social trends, at a local, regional and global level;
• the materiality of the indicators and of the topics covered: for each topic the 
materiality of the same was assessed in terms of relevance in the decision-making 
process of the Stakeholders and sustainable effects generated by the activity of the 
two terminals in the economic, social and environmental sphere;
• the completeness of the information: in order to allow readers to evaluate the 
performance of the organisations in the reference period and the related impacts 
at the economic, environmental and social level, additional information and data 
were included with respect to the requirements of the GRI guidelines, reporting the 
reasons in case of unavailability of data (see paragraph 7.4 “Standard contents 
and GRI indicators”).
