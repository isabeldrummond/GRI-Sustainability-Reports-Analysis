For SECH and TDT it is crucial to establish, implement and maintain 
processes aimed at the continuous identification and elimination of 
hazards, so as to minimise the risks to the health and safety of operators 
(in terms of probability of occurrence or potential severity of the damage 
achieved). These processes take into consideration, in addition to routine 
business  activities,  also  non-routine  activities,  accidents,  emergency 
situations and organisational changes.
Once the hazard identification and risk assessment phases have been 
completed,  the  terminals  adopt  effective  preventive  and  protective 
measures, to guarantee the protection of the health and safety of 
workers and all those who access the companies’ premises.
Furthermore, SECH and TDT implement a system of controls aimed at ascertaining the 
compliance of the health and safety management system with the mandatory and 
voluntary standards of reference and at verifying the implementation and effectiveness 
of the prevention and protection measures planned based on the risk assessment 
activity, as well as the preparation of resources and adequate means to maintain and 
continuously improve the management system. It should be noted that, in 2019, cases 
of non-compliance with laws and/or regulations were not ascertained or reported for 
both terminals.
