SECH AND TDT
MEET THE EXPECTATIONS
OF THE STAKEHOLDERS 
 FRUIT LOGISTICA 2019 
AND TOC EUROPE 2019
In 2019 SECH and TDT were present with their own booth 
at the Fruit Logistica event, held in Berlin from February 
6th to 8th, and at the TOC Europe event, held in Munich 
from June 4th to 8th.
Fruit  Logistica  is  the  world’s  leading  platform  for 
innovations  in  the  fruit  and  vegetable  sector,  with 
over 3,200 exhibitors and 78,000 visitors from over 130 
countries. The two terminals promoted the services linked 
to the sea transport logistics of the fruit and vegetable 
sector and hosted various shipping companies and 
port operators in their booth, providing spaces reserved 
for B2B meetings and presentations.
TOC  Europe,  on  the  other  hand,  in  which  the  two 
terminals took part for the first time, is the only global 
commercial  and  network  event  that  has  brought 
together the port and terminal industry for over 40 years, 
offering suppliers of port equipment and technologies 
a platform to sell products and services to terminal 
operators around the world.
