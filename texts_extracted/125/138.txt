During 2019 the total number of training hours carried out at SECH remained in line 
with the previous years and concerned almost all the resources in force.
It is useful to highlight that the hours of managerial training and professional updating 
are an expression of the company’s will, while the hours of safety training are also 
mandatory. In fact, for the year 2020, various training activities are planned, some of 
which deriving from the obligations established by the State-Regions Agreements on 
health and safety in the workplace.
In 2019, a potential assessment process began, aimed at a small group of figures 
belonging to SECH and TDT, with the aim of identifying strengths, areas for improvement 
and the possibility of developing their human resources to enhance their growth paths. 
The first training courses in this regard, as far as SECH is concerned, started in October.
Continuing a journey that has been going on for years now, SECH’s commitment to 
training and prevention has continued. The number of emergency workers has grown 
and it has become more necessary than ever to carry their path in terms of first training 
or compulsory updating.
Also with regard to safety, SECH, after the purchase of three external semi-automatic 
AED10, organised a course for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation with 
AED for 36 people, three of which are workers’ safety representatives (RLS).
