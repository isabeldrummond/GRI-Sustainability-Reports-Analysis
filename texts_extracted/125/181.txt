6.9 SECURITY
Security management in SECH and TDT has always been of paramount 
importance, in consideration of the fact that the terminals are exposed 
to potential thefts as well as attempts to cross the threshold by illegal 
immigrants.
Following the tragic event of September 11th, 2001 and the issuing in 2004 of the 
International Security Code - ISPS Code, the terminals further raised their level of 
attention, also aimed at managing potential terrorist attacks.
SECH and TDT terminals provide specific training to all internal personnel with security 
duties,  in  compliance  with  the  provisions  and  requirements  of  international  and 
national regulations, and carry out familiarisation interventions with all the rest of the 
company personnel, in order to obtain the greatest awareness possible of the issues 
for all employees.
The guidelines to which SECH and TDT refer to for the provision of the aforementioned 
EL - 10 ANNI Rollup GG x SOCI.indd   1 21/05/19   15:06
security training activities are the IMO Model Course 3.24 and 3.25 - designed to 
facilitate the adoption of the International Convention on training, certification and 
performance standards Marine Guard (STCW) of 1978 - and ISPS Code sheet 6 of the 
National Maritime Security Program (PNSM).
As a company rule and as required by the reference standards, also the companies 
providing security services must operate at the terminals with staff duly trained under 
the ISPS Code.
It should also be noted that the code of ethics of the two organisations, in addition to 
identifying the set of values   that represent corporate social ethics, contain the guiding 
principles that must be complied with by all those who directly or indirectly establish 
relationships with SECH and TDT.
In fact, these individuals, each within the scope of their responsibilities, according to the 
principles of sound and prudent management and in compliance with national and 
EU laws, as well as policies, plans, regulations, and internal procedures, must contribute 
to the achievement of the corporate mission and must also report to the supervisory 
body, set up together with the adoption of the organisational model pursuant to 
legislative decree 231/2001, all useful information on any deficiencies in the controls, 
reprehensible behaviour or founded suspicions of “bad management”.
By way of example, some of the ethical principles adopted by the terminals and 
specifically referable to the exercise of security activities are cited: responsibility and 
compliance  with  laws,  impartiality,  integrity,  protection  of  privacy  and  individual 
personality, repudiating any manifestation of violence, especially if aimed at limiting 
personal freedom.
In particular, as regards security checks on people and their personal effects, these 
are carried out respecting the fundamental rights and dignity of the human person, 
respecting gender and different cultural and religious sensitivities.
The supervisory bodies existing in both terminals perform periodic assessments on the 
company work, so that the applicable and internal voluntarily adopted rules, such as 
the code of ethics, are always respected.
With regard to the SECH terminal, to date, the percentage of personnel performing 
specific security duties and trained in human rights matters is 100%.
