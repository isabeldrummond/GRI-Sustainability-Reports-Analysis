The measured sound pressure levels, relevant to both day and night periods, are lower than Class VI 
limits. Since these are measurement stations which are located not far from the borders, respectively 
with Class IV (P1) and Class V (P2, P3), it is important to underline that the limits of the two lower 
classes are also respected. The verification will be repeated in 2020 in compliance with the four-year 
periodicity, on the occasion of safety measures relating to the exposure of workers to noise.
