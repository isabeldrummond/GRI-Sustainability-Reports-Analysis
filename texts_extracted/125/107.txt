For both terminals all energy performance indicators are affected by the number of 
temperature controlled containers stored, whose units are kept at certain temperatures 
by means of electrical columns, partly connected to the electricity network (plus 
rented diesel generators added for this purpose). In the three-year period 2017-2019, 
the plugging registered significant variations, with a consumption that depends on the 
energy efficiency of the reefer, on the quantities and on the dwell times and therefore 
hides the reductions obtained with the energy saving measures adopted.

For TDT, emission intensity has decreased over time thanks to the energy efficiency 
actions listed in paragraph 5.3 “Impacts reduction”. Any non-reduction values are due 
to logistical/operational aspects. The consequent GHG emissions are therefore also 
decreased, both in absolute and normalised terms. Please note that emissions from 
electricity are calculated with the ISPRA database for GHG factors and the composition 
of the national energy mix, equal to 43% of renewable energy in 2019, even if TDT 
electricity is 100% from renewable sources. Therefore emissions and emission intensities 
would be close to zero.
