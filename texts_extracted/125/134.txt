At SECH, the previous value of personnel turnover was confirmed, which remains at 
absolutely low values. It is believed that this is a positive element and an index of a 
good corporate climate, also due to the possibility of internal staff growth.
At TDT, the three-year period 2017-2019 saw a peak in the increase in positive turnover in 
2017 which gradually decreased significantly over the following two years. The negative 
turnover rate, stable in the first two years of the three-year period, fell significantly in 
2019 (-1 percentage point), until it almost halved; this not so much due to a strong 
slowdown in exoduses, rather it is owing to a lower impact on the overall workforce, 
already reduced by the leavings of the previous years.
