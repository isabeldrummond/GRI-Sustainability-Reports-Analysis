5.1.2.1 SECH WATER DISCHARGE
Water  discharges  originating  from  activities  carried  out  within  SECH 
terminal are similar to domestic and industrial waste water, as they are 
obtained by mixing water from toilets, including showers. The washing of 
the vehicles takes place in a dedicated area served by a closed-cycle 
treatment plant, which does not generate any discharge in the receptor 
bodies. SECH does not produce discharges to the sea: it uses four 
“Imhoff”10 type tanks downstream of the treatment process.
SECH uses the area on the basis of a concession stipulated with the Port 
Authority on April 29th, 1993 and subsequent amendments. At the time 
of signing the concession, two “Imhoff” pits were already in the area, 
serving the administrative and operational buildings and to date the Port 
Authority has not yet transmitted the required authorisations, despite the 
various reminders. To these the following two add up, of which evidence 
of the authoritative situation is provided.

The washing system consists of an underground collection tank, which conveys the 
washing water to a first oil-removal tank. Through successive passages in other tanks, 
the material is increasingly purified, separating the solid components and neutralising 
the polluting substances. At the end of the purification cycle, the purified water is 
introduced into the circuit that feeds the vehicle washing system. The sludge deriving 
from water purification is automatically pumped into a special separate tank for the 
transfer as well as the purpose of their subsequent disposal. The area affected by the 
washing operations is subject to cleaning by specialised personnel from an external 
company. Maintenance and control over the operation of the plant are entrusted with a 
regular contract to a specialised company, which carries out the assessments monthly.
