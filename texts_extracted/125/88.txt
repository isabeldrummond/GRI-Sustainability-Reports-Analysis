5.1.2.2 TDT WATER DISCHARGE
The water discharges originating from the activities carried out inside TDT 
terminal are both domestic (toilets) and industrial (vehicle washing).
The  wastewater,  previously  treated  within  the  five  purification  plants, 
is released into the sea (surface water), except in one case, with the 
introduction into the soil.
In 2015 all the authorisations were included in the Single Environmental 
Authorisation (AUA) with a fortnightly expiry. The company is required to 
ensure the correct operation of the plants and, in order to communicate 
any changes and to this end, enters into a contract every year for the 
maintenance of the treatment plants and waste analysis, every four 
months, as well as for interventions in the event of malfunctions and 
extraordinary assessments.
Possible malfunctions and deviations from the quality objectives have 
been  managed  with  extraordinary  maintenance,  outdoor  emptying, 
washing and adjustments.
