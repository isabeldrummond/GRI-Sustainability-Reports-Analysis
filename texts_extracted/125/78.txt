At TDT, on the other hand, 60% of total energy needs are covered by electricity and the 
remaining 40% comes from diesel. Of the electricity consumption, 46% is due to the 
supply of temperature-controlled containers (stored at the terminal, awaiting loading 
or withdrawal), 33% from the quay cranes consumption and the remainder from the 
sum of the yard lighting and office activities, as shown in the graph below. In 2019, 
electricity consumption for lighting was reduced by 46%, thanks to the replacement of 
the sodium lights of the light towers with LED lights at the end of 2018.
