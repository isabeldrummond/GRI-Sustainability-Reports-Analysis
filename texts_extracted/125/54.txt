The equity structures of SECH and TDT and their economic health are  C 
MI
essential for their sustainability. Companies are born to create profit and  O

there can be no sustainable development without creating value and  CO
E
economic solidity.
In this regard, it is useful to highlight that, on December 4th, 2017, 
SECH  and  TDT  joined  the  national  tax  consolidation  pursuant  to 
articles 117/129 of the Consolidated Income Tax Act (TUIR) with the 
parent company Gruppo Investimenti Portuali S.p.A., which acts as a 
consolidating company and determines a single tax base for the group 
of companies participating in the national tax consolidation and which 
thus benefits from the possibility to offset taxable income with tax losses 
in a single declaration. Each company participating in the national tax 
consolidation transfers the tax income (taxable income or tax loss) to the 
consolidating company. Gruppo Investimenti Portuali S.p.A. recognizes 
a credit towards companies that provide taxable income, equal to the IRES (i.e. 
corporation tax) to be paid. On the other hand, towards companies that make tax 
losses, Gruppo Investimenti Portuali S.p.A. records a debt equal to IRES on the part of 
the loss actually offset at group level.
The group of companies participating in the tax consolidation consists of:
• SE.BE.R. Srl with registered office in Genoa (GE), Calata Sanità Palazzina Uffici, 16126;
• Terminal Contenitori Porto di Genova S.p.A. (SECH) with registered office in Genoa
