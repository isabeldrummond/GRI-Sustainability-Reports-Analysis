5.1.4.2 LEAKAGES
The leaking containers are immediately housed in containment tanks, 
which prevent the pouring of substances into the sensitive receptor 
bodies. At TDT, since 2010 management costs are charged to the owner 
of the goods, as often the causes are insufficient or incorrect packaging. 
This allowed a recovery of management costs and greater attention 
during the preparation of the load, with a significant reduction in the 
occurring of such events, as shown in the table below. The starting 
incidence was 0.0148% against the current 0.0022%, going from about 
20 cases per year to <10 today. Also at SECH the cost incurred for the 
management  of  any  leaking  containers  is  borne  by  the  shipping 
company, without charges for the terminal. Obviously this does not apply 
in case of damaged containers during the handling phase, for which an 
internal cost is generated.
