6.6.1 SECH approach
For  2019,  with  a  view  to  continuously  improving  health  and  safety 
performance, SECH has undertaken the following initiatives:
» 
WORKERS’ COMMUNICATION,  
PARTICIPATION AND INVOLVEMENT
• In November 2019 a new monitor was installed 
in  the  dining  room  below  the  office  of  the 
operations  superintendents,  which  adds  up  to 
the two monitors installed in the dining areas of 
both terminal buildings. In this way, the company 
communication  channels  aimed  at  workers  have  been  further 
enhanced, as it is now also possible from this area, crowded by 
employees and third party workers, who in various times intervene in the terminal, to 
view the contents projected within the company schedule. The display of the wind 
conditions status always appears on a second monitor, which has been integrated 
into the corporate network, an aspect that should guarantee better reliability in the 
event of breakdowns and blackouts, since the IT department can also intervene 
remotely;
• the meetings of the “improvement groups” took place from December 2018 and 
February 2019, an initiative requested by most of the resources, who expressed their 
willingness to be more involved and informed on the different aspects

different departments to meet and create synergies favouring 
collaboration, with the aim of obtaining better performing 
business  results,  in  a  context  that  becomes  increasingly 
challenging and competitive. In this sense, each resource 
participated in the activities envisaged by the “improvement 
groups”, within which everyone had the opportunity to share 
information and ideas, to bring solutions aimed at improving 
productivity,  climate  and  organisation  in  the  departments

the participants was positive, in fact the unanimous request was to keep up the 
meetings, but, above all, to follow up on the proposals that emerged during the 
classroom works, through an activity of collecting and organising all the comments  Y

PPE
Always with a view to continuous improvement, in 2019 the purchase of safety shoes 
was re-evaluated with the company RLS, directing the choice towards a more durable 
and robust model. The electrical maintenance personnel was also equipped with 
better gloves for protection during work under voltage or in the vicinity up to 500 V. 
A pneumatic verifier was purchased for these devices, in order to carry out their six-
monthly testing.
