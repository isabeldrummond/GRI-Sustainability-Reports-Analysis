5.1.4 Discharges to the ground
The aspects of the business activities of SECH and TDT which may have an impact on 
the ground and subsoil are mainly related to:
• Possible oil/gas spills from tanks of vehicles or their components;
• leaking containers;
• spills of diesel fuel in the phase of fuelling from the tank (only for TDT);
• spills of additive for reachstackers (only for SECH);
• leakage of acidic liquids from batteries;
• spills of liquid waste stored on the waste separation area (only for SECH).
The management of these events is defined by instructions and system procedures and 
is aimed at avoiding contamination of the environmental matrices (soil and water). 
The spill and pouring source is signalled and segregated in various ways. Immediately

a non-conformity and a remediation treatment is opened. BILIT
