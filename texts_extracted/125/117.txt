5.1.11 Odorous emissions
For both terminals, the activity carried out does not give rise to significant 
olfactory impacts, as they are limited to the emissions of motor vehicles 
and heavy vehicles. More significant odorous emissions may instead be 
due to the presence of vessels at quay and railway locomotives.
For TDT, the activities of the adjacent petrochemical centre, which affects 
all the nearby residential area of Stagno mostly in windy conditions 
from the ground (N-NE) or in the absence of winds, represent the most 
significant source of odorous emissions in the area. The number of 
sources estimated for this sector is more than 500, some with a significant 
olfactory impact, others of little relevance, but an important emission 
source, being close together. The petrochemical sector alone constitutes 
94% of the emission sources surveyed.
In  the  absence  of  a  specific  national  legislation  and  therefore  of 
mandatory limits to odorous emissions, the preparation of a “Monitoring 
and Control Plan” was indispensable. The municipal administrations of 
Leghorn and other municipalities therefore entrusted ARPAT 33 with the 
work order and in October 2016 a monitoring plan and control of odorous 
emissions for that area was presented, which set the goal of achieving the 
maximum possible reduction in the levels of odorous emissions coming 
from industrial and service sources, through the adoption, for many 
companies in a voluntary form, of targeted and effective interventions to 
achieve a positive impact on olfactory pollution.
