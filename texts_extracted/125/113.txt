As far as TDT is concerned, the last technical evaluation was carried out in 2017 and 
was addressed as exposure of workers to electromagnetic fields.
Here are the conclusions:
 TDT OUTCOMES
 The measurements carried out at the company “TERMINAL DARSENA TOSCANA S.R.L.” 
were carried out in all workplaces considered to be potentially exposed to magnetic 
and/or electromagnetic fields, by extension to the previous assessments.
Both the measurements of magnetic induction at mains frequency (50 Hz) and those 
of radio-frequency electromagnetic field (100 kHz - 3 GHz) have been carried out - 
as specified by the Standard - by placing the measuring instrument, unless otherwise 
specified, at a height of 1.5 metres from the ground, measuring the emissions for a 
period of 6 minutes and recording the maximum value, the minimum and the average 
RMS value. Inspection measurements were made keeping the instrument at a height 
of 1.5 metres and at a distance from walls and metal objects greater than 1 metre, and 
moving it slowly into the room or area under investigation.
The measuring points were 56 and concerned: terminal facilities (electrical substations, 
reefer  towers,  access  point  towers,  offices,  etc.),  external  areas,  equipment  and 
operating vehicles in use.
From the surveys and measurements carried out, with the active sources analysed, 
THERE ARE NO EVENTS FOR TDT WORKERS OVER THE ACTION LIMITS ENVISAGED BY THE 
LEGISLATION.
