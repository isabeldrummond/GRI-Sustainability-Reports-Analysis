Furthermore, at an European level, Genoa and Gioia Tauro are among the first fifteen ports, with 
Genoa in seventh position, behind Le Havre between the ports of final destination and in twelfth 
position if we also consider the transshipment ports.
In Italy container traffic in ports remained stable at 10.6 million TEUs in 2019, but highlighting two 
different trends. The ports of final destination saw their numbers slightly increase (around 8 million 
TEUs), while the transhipment ports experienced another year of decline.
Genoa, considering the preliminary data, closed the year with over 2.6 million TEUs, an increase of  ES

0.2% compared to the previous year, despite the constant flaws in the road system and the still living  A

consequences that arise from the aftermath of the tragedy of the collapse of Ponte Morandi.6 O

The numbers of Leghorn also grew, going from 748.024 TEUs to about 790.000 TEUs, considering that  H

together the two major terminals in the port moved 789.833 TEUs.
