6.1 HR EVOLUTION AND COMPOSITION
SECH workforce, which has remained more or less stable in recent years, 
suffered a slight decrease since 2018, due to the exits of some employees 
not compensated by as many hires.
Over the past three years, TDT’s workforce has undergone a slight decline 
(- about 3%), mainly due to leavings to achieve retirement requirements 
(17 out of 21 exoduses), which two voluntary resignations and two layoffs 
add up to. 
In both companies, permanent contracts represent - currently - the main 
contractual form used, representing almost 100% of the total contracts 
in force. Y
