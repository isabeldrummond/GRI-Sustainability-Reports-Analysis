4.5 DISTRIBUTION OF VALUE  
– ECONOMIC IMPACTS
The economic impact of SECH and TDT does not end with the production and 
distribution of added value; the focus of the two companies is not, in fact, only to 
produce profits for the shareholders, nonetheless also to create job opportunities and 
economic growth for the local community.
As  regards  infrastructures,  the  two  organisations  concentrated,  in  particular,  on 
interventions aimed at improving productivity and raising safety levels within the 
terminals, improving the working conditions of the personnel.
