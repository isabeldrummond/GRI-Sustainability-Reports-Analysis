5.1.6.1 DIFFUSE EMISSIONS
The entire area of   the terminals is affected by the presence of diffuse 
emissions, mainly attributable to:
• Exhaust gas emissions from handling equipment;
• methane,  sulphates  and  other  emissions  from  purification  plants 
(only for TDT).
To such emissions the following ones add up from neighbouring activities 
upstream and downstream of the process (treated in the indirect aspects 
section, paragraph 5.2), like:
• Exhaust gas emissions from vessels, trucks and trains in transit;
• diffuse dust emissions from the filling operations of the reclaiming tank 
with dredging sludge (TDT only).
CO  emissions related to diffuse direct and indirect emissions due to

diesel  and  electricity  consumption  are  quantified  and  reported  in 
paragraph 5.1.6.1 “Diffuse emissions” (air pollutant).
Emissions related to diffuse direct and indirect emissions due to the 
consumption of diesel and electricity can be quantified in terms of 
emission of tons of CO equivalent and greenhouse gases.

nitrogen emissions at the exhaust, through the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) 
system, which works by adding urea to the exhaust gases.
Below are some tables showing the quantification of pollutant emissions deriving from 
the combustion of diesel engines of yard equipment. The calculation of the emissions 
was estimated using standard emission factors reported in “EMEP / EEA - Emission 
Inventory Guidebook 2013” published by the EEA18.
