2.1 GIP MISSION
GIP is a holding company founded in 1993 by four Genoese families, with the aim of 
becoming an active part of the logistics chain for containerised cargo.
Over the years, GIP has grown, focusing on its core business to become one of the first 
terminal operators in Italy, thanks to its majority stake in SECH, Genoa and TDT, Leghorn.
Furthermore, GIP holds minority shares in other important Italian container terminals 
(VTE - VECON).
In February 2017, Infracapital and Infravia, specialised infrastructure funds, acquired 
95% of GIP from the previous owners, aiming to further develop it through an ambitious 
expansion programme.
 GRUPPO INVESTIMENTI PORTUALI (GIP) 
Gruppo Investimenti Portuali (GIP) strives to develop and consolidate its presence in 
the competitive scenario of the Mediterranean terminal operators.
The companies under GIP carry out their activities with the aim of ensuring and in-

partners, collaborators, suppliers and port communities.
They operate according to the principles of transparency, efficiency, fairness and sen-
se of responsibility, having the primary objective of safeguarding the health and sa-
fety of workers, always with a glimpse to protecting the environment.
