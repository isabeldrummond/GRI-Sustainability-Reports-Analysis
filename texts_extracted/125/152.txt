HEALTH SURVEILLANCE
Health surveillance is one of the preventive measures for workers exposed 
to health risks which may be caused by physical, chemical, biological or 
ergonomic agents.
Health checkups are carried out according to a schedule defined 
by the competent physician in agreement with the employers of the 
terminals, who is in possession of the requisites foreseen by the law, 
carrying out medical examinations in suitable environments equipped 
for the checkup of the various aspects of physical and psycho-attitudinal 
functionality of workers.
The outcomes of the medical examination are attached to the health and risk record 
and according to them the competent doctor expresses a judgment relating to the 
specific task, which may be: suitability; partial, temporary or permanent unsuitability, 
with prescriptions or limitations; temporary unsuitability; permanent unsuitability.
The activity of the competent physician does not end with the health surveillance of the 
workers, in fact he/she collaborates with the employer and with the HSSE department 
for the risk assessment and the implementation of the measures for the protection 
of health and psycho-integrity of workers; they also collaborate in the organisation 
of the first-aid service, with particular regard to the definition of medical-surgical aids 
available to the first-aid workers in charge.
The competent doctor also participates in the information and training of workers 
and is the only one authorised to provide information to workers about the results of 
diagnostic tests and health surveillance and the delivery of medical documentation, 
upon request or upon termination of the employment relationship. It is important to 
underline that the risk health record contains sensitive data and must therefore be 
treated in compliance with professional secrecy and the provisions of Legislative 
Decree 196/2003 regarding the protection of personal data.
In addition to the health surveillance activities described above, both terminals signed 
private insurance, to guarantee all workers access to health services, even outside of 
work, with the aim of preserving health thanks to programmes of annual checkups and 
further visits and examinations for diagnostic tests.
