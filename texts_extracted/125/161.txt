 
   TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF ... 
         YOU ARE A WORK OF ART 
On the occasion of the 2019 World day for Safety and Health at work, TDT promoted a 
campaign entitled “Take care of yourself ... You are a work of art”, created by Unigum 
as part of the “Educating to safety” project, which has the objective of conveying the 
message of safety in a diverse way from all the already existing campaigns on the 
subject.
The purpose of the campaign was to promote and encourage the use of personal 
protective equipment, through unconventional images that do not rely on fear, but 
on beauty, uniqueness and the desire to love each other.
Two  totems  were  exhibited,  postcards  were 
distributed, some T-shirts and themed posters 
were displayed in the areas mostly visited 
by the personnel.
In addition to the awareness campaign 
on the topic, the security office took 
the  opportunity  to  distribute  to 
all  employees  a  questionnaire 
on “The  perception  of  security 
in  port”  created  by  ASL1,  Port 
Authority  and  INAIL2,  as  part 
of  the  wider “Prevention  plan 
aimed at improving job security 
in companies operating in the 
ports of Leghorn and Piombino”.
