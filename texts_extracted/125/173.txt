• carrying out alcoholic checks on employees in the company during the evening 
shifts;
• carrying out specific checks on all the gangways of the cranes to ascertain the 
presence of any loose element on the fixing bars, in order to prevent any fall of 
materials from above;
• planning the periodic verification of the anchorage points of the safety signs posted 
on the cranes, as they are exposed to the risk of falling in case of strong wind;
• verification, together with the manufacturer, of any design or manufacturing defects 
in the cables of the spreader of the cranes;
• construction of a traffic light system on the quay aimed at indicating the correct 
position in which to park the prime movers during vessels’ operations, in order to 
prevent any accidents;
• integration of the fire-fighting equipment with an extinguisher for vehicles, mostly 
used by emergency workers, in order to always guarantee prompt intervention;
• insertion into the system of periodic verification of the entire spreader fleet, to 
ascertain any anomalies or loosening.
As for TDT, the most significant actions resulting from the 2019 nearmiss records are the 
following:
• Integration of a section of fence in the gate area-visitor area, to avoid new jersey 
overpasses during operations;
• replacement of the original pads of quay cranes with other more performing and 
resistant ones;
• integration of non-destructive controls on spreaders with penetrating/ultrasound 
liquids on an annual basis;
• distribution of information, by the HSSE department, to make the operators more 
aware of always reporting to the offices in charge cases of strong impacts to the 
spreader, ropes and anomalies in general on the equipment;
• implementation of a daily check on the spreader of the operating cranes during 
the shift change between the first and second shift;
• additional  control  introduced  on  the  “full”  tyres  of  the  scissors  lift:  monthly 
measurement of the distance of the centre of the wheel axis from the ground on a 
level surface with the machine always in the closed configuration;
• in addition to the above, during 2019, against certain events, ad-hoc written 
reminders  were  issued  and  specific  training  reminders  were  provided,  where 
necessary.
