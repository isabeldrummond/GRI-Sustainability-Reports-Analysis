6.4 SUPPLIERS’ QUALIFICATION, SELECTION 
AND ASSESSMENT
The  companies  prepared  and  maintained  active  documented 
procedures  regarding  the  qualification  of  suppliers,  i.e.  their  initial 
assessment,  selection  and  periodic  re-evaluation,  with  particular 
reference to the aspects of quality, environment, safety and anticorruption, 
in order to guarantee the capacity of the same to meet the supply 
requirements. On the strategic or common purchase categories, the 
qualification of a new supplier is subject to the approval of the holding’s 
purchasing department, which has the task of verifying the coherence 
of the proposal with the defined purchase strategies.
The initial qualification consists in verifying the possession of the basic 
requirements to be able to work with the terminals, so that the process 
may take place in compliance with the criteria of transparency, equal 
opportunities of access, professionalism, reliability and cost-effectiveness, 
without prejudice to the prevalence of the requirements of legality. These 
assessments allow the keeping of a list of suppliers approved by the 
terminals, which purchase orders can be issued to.
A monitoring activity is subsequently developed for the suppliers, mainly by monitoring 
the quality of the supplies and services provided, and by periodically revaluating the 
suppliers, modifying and supplementing the list of qualified suppliers.
The criteria for choosing supplies include an overall assessment considering the 
following parameters:
Compliance with the functional specifications defined in the purchase request and

diligence.
