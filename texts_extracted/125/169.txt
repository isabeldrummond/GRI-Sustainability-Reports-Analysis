6.7.1.2 TDT INJURIES ANALYSIS
Compared to the previous year, 2019 recorded a slight increase in the number of 
accidents at work: 10 events against the 5 occurred in 2018.
The figure is in any case in line with the positive trend that has been established since 
2012, the year from which an average of just under 11 accidents per year was recorded, 
an already improving value compared to the previous period 2006-2011, in which the 
average was 28 accidents per year and for the period 2009-2011 (first three years of 
certification, more undeviating in number of employees and hours worked), in which 
the average was 25 accidents per year.
Also as regards the number of days of absence from work, an appreciable improvement 
of 34.4% was recorded, if compared with the average for the decade 2009-2019 (going 
from 691 average days of injury to 453 in 2019), and an improvement of about 11% 
compared to the period of the previous three years (2016-2018).
The improvement trend over the years is shown in the following graph: frequency 
(22.23), incidence (34.17), severity (1.01).
