6.7.2 Nearmiss
The attention of the terminals is also constantly addressed to the identification of the so-
called nearmiss, that is, of those accidents for which, due to a fortunate circumstance, 
no damage to people occurred, but that if these favourable conditions had not 
occurred, they could have had consequences, sometimes even of a certain severity.
The analysis of the nearmiss represents, therefore, an important prevention tool, as it 
provides the terminals with significant information regarding the signals of malfunction 
of the HSSE management system. It should also be considered that not only losses from 
accidents are economically significant for the company, but also productivity losses 
resulting from interruptions in the work process, caused by those events that do not 
cause accidents or material damage.
The terminals therefore analyse and deal with nearmiss, with the aim of identifying new 
potential dangers and providing adequate and effective measures, that can avoid the 
recurrence of these events.
In particular, in the face of nearmiss occurred in 2019, SECH has initiated the following 
corrective actions:
• Recall of some employees or external workers, through their respective reference 
figure,  in  order  to  raise  awareness  about  compliance  with  the  correct  work 
procedures;
• sending communications to invite maintenance work to be carried out on the 
ship’s deck;
• operators awareness, through the campaign on safe behaviours, also focussed on 
the correct use of PPE, and monitoring, so that operators wear the protective helmet;
