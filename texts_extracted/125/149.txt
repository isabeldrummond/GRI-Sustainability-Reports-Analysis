 SAFETY CAMPAIGN
In 2019, the Safety Campaign ended, launched in 2018, to sensitise workers and 
permanent suppliers to adopting safe behaviours that can prevent accidents.  As part 
of this initiative, classroom meetings were organised with workers, films and themed 
panels and posters were affixed, with the slogan “PROTECTION ISN’T ENOUGH 
IF YOU DON’T USE YOUR HEAD” (concept of the whole Campaign) and others 
on the risks covered, relating to: safe driving, use of PPE, compliance with the rules, 
correct perception of the risk, activities on board the ship and dangerous goods. To 
create greater involvement in relation to the message to be conveyed, some SECH 
and TDT workers who, under the patronages of GIP, participated in the creation of 
posters and videos were chosen as testimonials of the Campaign. Furthermore, new 
information and brochures have been printed, containing the rules of safe behaviour 
for visitors and transporters. The same rules of conduct have been affixed by means 
of suitable vertical signage, at the waiting rooms for acceptances and installed at 
the visits and general cargo areas. At the end of the Campaign, a questionnaire 
was administered to all the participants in the training course, some of whom were 
interviewed to better understand the meaning and scope of the answers provided in 
order to highlight any critical issues and strengths that emerged.
