As emerges from the data analysis, over the years, the most frequently occurring case 
history is linked to the “ascending, descending, walking” macro-category, followed, in 
2019, by the “falling/tumbling” cases, that is, the cases of accidents which occur while 
the victim walks, descends a stair or an operating vehicle or climbs up there. It should 
be noted that it is precisely in this area, mostly linked to the behavioural aspect, that 
the management system focusses its interventions; over the years, the reduction in 
accidents is linked precisely to the clear improvement that the workplace health and 
safety management system has brought to this area.
