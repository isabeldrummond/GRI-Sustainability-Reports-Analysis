Current taxes include all taxes calculated on the company’s taxable income by 
applying the tax rates in force on the balance sheet date. Current income taxes and 
deferred taxes are recorded in the income statement, with the exception of taxes that 
derive from transactions charged directly to equity or from business combinations.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined with the tax rates established by the tax 
legislation in force at the balance sheet date. Deferred taxes are allocated according 
to the global liability allocation method applied on the temporary differences at the 
balance sheet date between the tax value of assets and liabilities and the book value 
at which they are entered in the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets on unused tax 
losses and tax credits that can be carried forward, as well as on deductible temporary 
differences, are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income 
will be available such as to allow the realisation of such deferred tax assets. The 
deferred tax asset is reviewed on the balance sheet date and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be achievable to allow 
the recorded asset to be recovered in whole or in part.
In greater detail of the above, this part highlights the economic performance of the 
companies, providing the main balance sheet and economic data of the financial 
statements for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years.
