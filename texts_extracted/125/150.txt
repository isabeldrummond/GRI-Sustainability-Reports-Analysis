 WORKERS’ PARTICIPATION, CONSULTATION AND 
COMMUNICATION REGARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY
SECH  and TDT  establish  processes  to  promote  the  communication, 
participation, consultation and involvement of workers in health and 
safety matters, both directly and indirectly through the company RLS; the 
company communication methods take place respecting the diversity 
of gender, language, culture, literacy and disability.
Through  the  communicative  processes,  organisations  prescribe 
appropriate behaviours in matters of health and safety towards internal 
and external subjects, such as, for example: direct and indirect workers, 
suppliers, contractors and visitors.
The corporate communication processes of SECH and TDT ensure that 
workers acquire the necessary awareness relatively to:
• Policy and objectives relevant to health and safety in the workplace;
• the importance of their own contribution to the effectiveness and improvement of 
the performance of the health and safety management system and the implications 
and potential consequences arising from not complying with the legal and system 
requirements;
• the active participation of workers in the analysis of the accidents concerning them

that workers at all levels are encouraged to report dangerous situations, so as to be 
able to take preventive measures and take corrective actions;
