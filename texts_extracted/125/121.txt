5.3 REDUCTION OF IMPACTS
5.3.1 Reduction of impacts at SECH
SECH, in 2015, commissioned externally and voluntarily (the company 
does not fall within the scope of application of the reference legislation) 
the execution of the energy diagnosis required by Legislative Decree 
102/2014, also in order to identify possible measures to improve their 
energy-environmental  performance.  The  outcome  highlighted  some 
measures and the relative margins for improvement, listed below:

Consumption monitoring
In order to keep energy consumption under control and to be able to consciously 
evaluate  any  corrective  and  energy  efficiency  activities,  SECH  checks  the  diesel 
consumption  of  all  owned  vehicles  through  daily  surveys:  the  activity  allows  to 
have indicators that can serve as a bell alarm in case of undetected malfunctions.
