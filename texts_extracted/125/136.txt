Training has become an increasingly important element for businesses 
to achieve success and it is clear that, in any work and production 
environment, it is necessary to be interconnected and to ensure that all 
workers, from the first to the last, feel they are taking part in a common 
project, so as to operate in a cohesive and efficient manner.
It is believed that, even from a psychological point of view, company 
training fulfills an indispensable task, in terms of utility and benefit, on 
a dual axis: for the workers, since they feel valued and essential for the 
performance of the company, and for the company itself, as in this way 
the workers will work with greater commitment and motivation.
Human resources are undoubtedly the tool with the most influence for the 
growth of companies and the importance of corporate training is clear 
as, through the personal and professional development of individuals, 
improvements are made on the whole working line.
Owing to training activities, creativity and spirit of initiative benefit from it, the ability to 
find cooperative solutions increases and workers acquire greater awareness about the 
meaning and importance of their role in the company; therefore the importance of 
corporate training should not be underestimated, as it allows a positive growth of SECH 
and TDT workers as well, which translates into a general development of the companies.
