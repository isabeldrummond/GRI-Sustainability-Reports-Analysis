6.7.1.1 SECH INJURIES ANALYSIS
Over the last decade, analysing the data relevant to SECH employees, they went from 
19 cases in 2009 to 10 events in 2019, with a 50% decrease in the accident phenomenon.
Further proof of the good statistical performance can be deduced from the strong 
contraction of the general phenomenon over the longer term, of more than 75%, 
obtained in the 10 years of activity (36 accidents with 210 employees in 2009 and 
10 accidents with 236 employees in 2019) as well as inferred from the chart below. 
Although in 2019 there was a decrease compared to 2018 (from 13 to 10 cases), in 
the last three years, however, the trend has shown a slight increase compared to the 
minimum point reached in 2013 and 2016, corresponding to 7 accident cases, also 
coinciding with less terminal operation.
