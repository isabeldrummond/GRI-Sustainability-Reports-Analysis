The transshipment was, in fact, in the last year, the pre-eminent cycle (42.25% vs. 29.10% 
of the export cycle and 28.65% of the import cycle), thanks to the transfer of Hapag 
Lloyd volumes from Cagliari to Leghorn (for instance, on Med Gulf Express, Med Pacific 
Express and Levante Express services) and to ZIM’s ZCA/AL7 service again operated 
at TDT, which allowed the reinstatement of part of the transshipment volumes lost in 
December 2018 due to insufficient draft (Ocean Alliance and THE Alliance had joined 
the AL6 and Amerigo services by introducing larger ships, 9,000 TEUs, thus unable to 
enter Leghorn and thence moved to La Spezia). ES

The year therefore began to score a growth, recording a rise of 28.18% compared to  MP

the first quarter of 2018, thanks to an increase in volumes for consolidated services  C

at the terminal and the acquisition, in March 2019, of the MedCan service operated  H
T
by Melfi Marine. This service, then, underwent a reorganisation during the year, first 
extending its service to Mexico with a fourth ship to maintain a fair navigation average, 
then returning to serve Mexican ports through transhipment at Cuba.
The second quarter also continued with the same positive trend, recording the peak in 
volumes handled during the year in May (35,000 units).
During this period Unimed Feeder Services (UFS) changed the coverage between 
Malta and western Italy, Sicily and Sardinia by replacing the Malta-Tyrrhenian service 
with a service dedicated to Italy, called New Tyrrhenian, and with the connection for 
Malta offered through slots on the Tyrrhenian Express Service operated by CMA CGM. 
This led to an increase in the average volumes per call for both the services involved.
