6.6.2 TDT approach
For  2019,  with  a  view  to  continuously  improving  health  and  safety 
performance, TDT undertook the following initiatives:
» 
WORKERS’ COMMUNICATION, PARTICIPATION 
AND INVOLVEMENT
TDT’s  commitment  to  continuously  improve  internal  and  external 
communication  processes,  participation  and  involvement  of  staff 
working at TDT is ongoing. 
As regards employees, the following initiatives are highlighted for 2019:
With a view to obtaining an ever greater and effective participation of 
workers in the analysis of incidental events involving them, since 2019 the 
HSSE workers have further improved the participation procedure of the RLS, so as they 
are pooled for each event analysis of the causes to agree on corrective actions.
In the second half of 2019 several specific meetings were convened between the HSSE 
workers and the RLS for the collection of reports and feedback on issues impacting on 
health and safety, for the sharing of ideas, projects and improvement proposals; the 
HSSE department keeps track of these meetings, sometimes even informal ones, in the 
management system, drawing up specific meeting minutes.
As regards the external users of the terminal, the main TDT activities aimed at improving 
the communication, participation and involvement area follow:

• Vertical signals and safety information
A  new  and  wider  signal  was  installed,  with  both  Italian  and  English  versions, 
containing the safety rules and the behaviours to be followed in the areas of the 
terminal with greater attendance by external staff as well as in the area dedicated 
to  the  storage  of  hazardous  containers.  Brochures  holders  containing  safety 
information sheets have also been positioned in some of the company’s busiest 
areas.
