SECH has prepared an analysis and an assessment of the environmental aspects 
and impacts, preparatory for the implementation of the environmental management 
system and the definition of adequate procedures for the control and prevention of 
environmental crimes, pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001; SECH periodically 
assesses the degree of compliance achieved with the medium-term objective of 
obtaining the certification, according to the UNI EN ISO 14001:2015 standard.
SECH  and  TDT  have  identified,  described  and  assessed  all  direct  and  indirect 
environmental aspects. The two terminals, although operating in different contexts, in fact

carry out very similar activities and, therefore, have largely assimilable environmental
