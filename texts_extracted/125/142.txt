6.5 TERMINALS’ PRIVACY PROTECTION 
AND DATA SECURITY  
 
The  issue  of  privacy  protection  and  personal  data  protection  is  of 
paramount importance for GIP. Throughout 2019, the group engaged in 
the consolidation of the internal culture in the privacy field and in the 
organisation of the activities started in previous years, in execution of the 
provisions of the European regulation on the protection of personal data 
(EU Regulation n.2016/679 - GDPR).
The main interventions on the topic, coordinated by the DPO - group data protection 
manager - concerned:
• A constant updating of the treatment register;
• updating of documentation, through:
» 
sending information and requests for consent to employees;
» 
sending information to visitors;
»

the preparation of documents for the exercise of the rights of the interested party 
and other affiliated activities;
• updating of the signs relating to video surveillance;
• the implementation of the data breach procedure;
• updating and distribution of company IT regulations to all staff;
• the audit on the GDPR, IT management and corporate business processes from 
which, following to the investigations, improvement actions arose;
• periodic meetings between the managers of the IT, HR, privacy, safety & security 
and compliance areas and the DPO, in order to constantly evaluate the state of 
compliance of the company with the regulations currently in force;
• the annual performance of the anti-intrusion tests in the systems, in order to monitor 
the effectiveness of the protection of the IT system with reference to possible 
unwanted access. In the last test, the result was positive and without observations;

Information security in the activities carried out by the two terminals also consists in 
establishing and maintaining a uniform standard, which allows the port cluster to move 
as a unicum and in the most efficient way possible, thus trying to minimise waste and 
correcting all those drifts that the use of different systems brings along.
