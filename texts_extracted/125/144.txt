6.6 HEALTH, SAFETY AND SECURITY 
AT WORK
WORLD DAY FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
 
The World Day for Safety and Health at Work is held on April 28th of each year, which 
is part of a campaign to promote safe, healthy and dignified work and is managed 
by the International Labour Organization (ILO) since 2003. A culture of safety and he-
alth at work is one in which the right to a healthy and safe working environment is re-
spected at all levels, where governments, employers and workers actively 
participate in the safety of a healthy working environment and safe 
through a system of defined rights, responsibilities and duties, 
and where the highest priority is accorded to the principle of 
prevention.
