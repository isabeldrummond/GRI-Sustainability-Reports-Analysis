5.1.7 Electromagnetic emissions
In both terminals the emissions of electromagnetic radiation are linked to 
the presence of electrical systems, transmitting antennas, servers and 
two-way radios for communication between people employed in the 
operations departments, when they are working at yard and between 
the internal planning and operations management offices.
At SECH a survey was conducted in July 2017 aimed at assessing electric 
field strengths and magnetic induction. The monitoring concerned the 
following sources: transformers, motors, equipment and control panels. 
The high-frequency electromagnetic field was also monitored, in order 
to highlight any contributions determined by the radio-communication 
system inside the terminal and any sources of external origin (radar and 
radio and tele-communication systems). A broadband field analyser 
equipped with three isotropic probes was used for this purpose, to make 
measurements both in low frequency ELF31 (1Hz – 400 kHz) and in high 
frequency RF 32 (100 kHz – 40 GHz).
The assessment results are as follows:

 SECH OUTCOMES
Measurements performed at SECH were made after identifying the points where the

equipment and electrical panels. The measurement points were then selected based  N

on the geometry of the spaces, the location of the sources and by a field level screening  UST
for the two components of the electromagnetic field. In total, 13 areas were identified  AL S

consisting of tools for daily use (grinding wheel, miter saw, welding machine, etc.) and 
were carried out with the operator in activity and positioning the probe near the head 
and the trunk. The results of the analysis carried out testified the compliance with the 
current regulations. The values   measured in low frequency (ELF) were always below the 
most precautionary threshold values, indicated as “General Public 1998” and those 
identified for the protection of workers and indicated as “2013/35/EU”, for workshop 
equipment. As far as the high frequency sources (RF) are concerned, the values   are 
often at the limit of the sensitivity of the instrument, or well below the regulatory limits.
31. ELF: Extremely Low Frequency.
32. RF: Radio Frequency.
