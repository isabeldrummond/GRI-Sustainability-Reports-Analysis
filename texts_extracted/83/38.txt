we  ask  each  counterparty  to  sign  them,  so 
that they morally commit to carrying out our 
own  values  for  respect  for  the  environment, 
human rights and communities. 
Each  stakeholder  must  therefore  actively  work  in  line  with  our  policies.  Our  staff  are 
constantly updated on internal compliance procedures, which are progressive and aim to 
continuously improve in line with industry standards. The collaboration between the various 
departments  is  constantly  valued  as  a  fundamental  tool  to  guarantee  continuous 
monitoring for each potential and already active counterpart. Our awareness of each of 
our counterparts is also constant in adhering to and applying the same standards that we 
have followed, to contribute to creating greater awareness of the possibilities we have to 
concretely improve our supply chain.
