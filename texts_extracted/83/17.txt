PROCESS
At  Italpreziosi  we  are  aware  of  the  centrality  of  all  17 
IDENTIFICATION Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and that is why we 
consider  the  need  to  treat  them  holistically  and  not 
individually.  Each  objective  influences  the  other,  and  it  is 
therefore  necessary,  within  the  limits  set  by  our  range  of 
action, to include the 17 objectives in all our activities. 
PRIORITISATION
The Materiality Assessment process is central to the drafting 
of  the  Sustainability  Report.  The  methodological  process 
integrated the following phases: 
IDENTIFICATION:  significant  issues  are  identified  by 
VALIDATION performing an analysis of the business context and 
our Business Plan;  
PRIORITISATION:  the  issues  that  more  than  others  will 
have a fundamental impact both inside and outside 
the company activities have been identified. In doing 
this,  the  involvement  of  our  stakeholders  and  the 
REPORT
inclusion of their visions in ours is fundamental; 
VALIDATION:  all  themes  and  aspects  identified  and 
prioritised  in  compliance  with  the  principle  of 
"completeness".   
REVIEW All these values, in addition to having been fundamental in 
the preparation of the Report, were crucial issues for the 
development of the 2020-2025 Business Plan.
