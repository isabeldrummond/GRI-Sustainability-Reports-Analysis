D ear collaborators and partners, 
for the first time Italpreziosi presents its sustainability report, a document that wants to summarise our values and 
our vision of the world and that illustrates what we have done and what we will do to pursue sustainable 
development in order to guarantee harmonious growth of our business not only in economic terms, but also socially 
and environmentally creating relationships based on transparency, trust and paying particular attention to the 
involvement  of  its  stakeholders,  shareholders,  employees,  collaborators,  customers,  suppliers,  governments, 
authorities and local communities. 
I have always made of the sustainable journey and humanistic capitalism, the guide of my career as an entrepreneur.  
With our sustainable path we want to promote a fairer and more harmonious future, respectful of the environment, 
of  the  planet's  resources,  of  human  dignity  by  enhancing  education,  training  and  awareness.  I  believe  that 
sustainability is a social pact with future generations as with this path, in our small way, we want to meet the needs 
of  the  present  generation  without  compromising  the  ability  of  future  generations  to  meet  their  own  needs. 
Sustainability, in our sector in particular, is a complex path and it takes a lot of determination and courage to find 
new solutions. 
Talking about ethical gold is a very dear topic for me and I would like to remind you that through GoldLake IP, 
already in 2007, we were among the first in the world to address these issues and above all to put them into practice 
with total traceability of gold from extraction to the finished jewel, having concluded an exclusive contract with 
Cartier. 
Ethics is that branch of philosophy that studies the conduct of human beings and the criteria on the basis of which 
behaviour and choices are evaluated. Ethics represents a way of acting, a concrete doing in everyday life, ethics is a 
word often used inappropriately because it is much easier to pronounce it than to put it into practice.
