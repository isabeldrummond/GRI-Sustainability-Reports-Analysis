 
We are committed to promoting sustainable and ethical businesses that allow the creation of 
a more inclusive market for everyone and respecting the environment in which they operate. 
This is why we are active in associations and organisations to improve sustainability in the 
precious metal industry and to reduce environmental, social and health impacts. 
For us, a sustainable approach means that we care about who, where and how this material is 
produced. Because every single actor is important in the supply chain. 
From  2019  we  joined  the  Program  Advisory  Group 
(PAG)  of  the  GEF  Gold  project,  (which  stands  for 
"Global Opportunities for Long Term Development in 
Artisanal  and  Small  Scale  Mining  Programme"), 
promoted  by  Planet  Gold.  The  project  includes 
multistakeholders, including International Organisations 
such  as  OECD,  UNDP,  UNEP,  UNIDO,  specialised 
associations,  the  private  and  public  sector, 
governments and authorities. The project involves eight 
countries with a high percentage of artisanal miners 
who  in  many  cases,  for  disinformation  and  lack  of 
support,  process  gold  with  chemicals  that  are 
extremely  dangerous  for  their  health  and  for  the 
environment that surrounds them, i.e. mercury. In line 
with  the  Minamata  Convention,  the  project  aims  to 
train and help these communities to avoid the use of 
mercury  by  replacing  it  with  better  techniques.  In 
addition, formalisation processes will also be supported, 
which  will  allow  access  to  the  legal  market  and 
improve their living conditions.
