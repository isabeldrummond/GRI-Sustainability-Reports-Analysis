EQUALITY
 
Our commitment to gender equality is constant. Our CEO, Ivana 
Ciabatti, has always been at the forefront to support initiatives 
that  enhance  women's  rights,  their  potential,  their  genius  and 
above all initiatives against violence (Women for Women).  
Our CEO is also a member of the international Women in Mining 
association, which involves women in the mining industry from all 
over the world. 
 
 
Our strength is consistency. In line with the SDGs, we 
  +13%

empower women, starting with our team: from 35% in 
2015, today women represent 48% of our workforce.
