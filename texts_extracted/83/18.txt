NVOLVEMENT
 S  
OF TAKEHOLDERS  
Involving our stakeholders represents a fundamental and constructive step for Italpreziosi to 
understand  its  current  and  future  performance,  but  also  to  seek  solutions  for  all  those 
challenges that our industry is facing.  
The evaluation of our performances together with an updated evaluation on common 
fundamental themes and dialogue are the basis of our daily work and the creation of a 
shared value in the long term. 
  
We regularly involve our stakeholders, from staff, to suppliers, customers, local communities, 
institutions, associations, industry groups, the press, with the aim of transparently transmitting 
our values and establishing relationships of trust and promoters of sustainable development in 
our sector.  
A  survey  was  carried  out  which  involved  all  our  stakeholders,  in  order  to  identify  and 
concretise the common objectives.

STAKEHOLDERS
PROTECTION OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE LIVE 
CONSTANT ENHANCEMENT OF 
OUR PEOPLE
TRANSPARENCY AND 
SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR SUPPLY
