Choosing responsible consumption and production is a crucial step  KYC
that every single actor in the supply chain must take for a safer future 
for our planet. 
In our Know Your Counterpart (KYC) onboarding procedures within the 
Compliance  Department,  careful  analysis  of  all  environmental 
documentation is carried out: all our suppliers, based on their activity, 
must present specific documentation attesting their commitment to 
maintaining adequate environmental standards. In addition, we always 
ask  for  additional  information  on  any  plans  to  reduce  or  totally 
eliminate impacts on the environment. We are also interested in detail 
of all the chemicals used in the process, which determine an important 
evaluation of the counterpart. We guarantee the highest standards of 
quality  and  sustainability  through  documented  verification  work 
followed  by  on-site  visits  to  certify  the  veracity  of  the  information 
obtained.
 
 
 
In 2019 we joined the GEF Gold Program Advisory Group (PAG), 
promoted by Planet Gold, which includes multi-stakeholders among 
the United Nations, NGOs, associations, private sector companies 
and public authorities. The project will be active in eight countries, 
and the goal is to work together to create projects involving small 
communities of artisanal miners and help them eliminate the use of 
mercury, one of the most harmful substances for the environment 
and human health, in line with the Minamata Convention.
