A   
SUSTAINABLE APPROACH
For over 37 years our mission was to be the point of reference for our customers within the precious 
metal chain by offering excellence, quality, safety, innovation and reliability. 
We are inspired by the principles of compliance, ethics, transparency, confidentiality and integrity, 
adopting the highest international standards and guidelines in managing our activities in all the 
contexts in which we operate.  
We consider sustainability as the engine of a continuous improvement process that guarantees results 
over time and the strengthening of economic performance and our reputation.  
The protection of the environment, the protection and promotion of human rights, the respect of safe 
and fair labour standards, also through technological innovation, represent the founding principles of 
our way of operating, in line with the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations.  
The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was presented in 2015. It represents an 
important awareness of the entire international community that has finally committed to collaborating 
and working every day to achieve the 17 common goals.  
For this reason, we immediately supported the initiative, in line with the values of our company. The 
objectives are the basis of the new 2020-2025 Business Plan which will accompany Italpreziosi on a 
path towards excellence thanks to its Sustainable Business Model.
