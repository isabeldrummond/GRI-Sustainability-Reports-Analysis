LOOKING AT THE
PRESENT
WE HAVE PHOTOVOLTAIC 
PANELS IN THE UPPER PART OF  Our systems are of the latest generation and high 
OUR BUILDING technology,  in  order  to  maximise  efficiency  and 
minimise  environmental  impact,  with  emissions 
close to zero. 
WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE 
Minimising  the  environmental  impact  is  a  crucial 
LOCAL ENERGY NETWORK 
WITH   goal for our company: considering that greenhouse 
gas emissions are one of the main causes of global 
warming and climate change, we have decided to 
avoid using one of the main causes of emissions, or 
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 
fossil fuels. This is the reason why we have chosen 
ARE ONE OF THE MAIN CAUSES 
OF CLIMATE CHANGE not to use coal and diesel in our refinery, but "cold" 
chemical  processes,  to  considerably  reduce 
emissions. 
WE THEREFORE USE COLD 
We also installed photovoltaic solar technologies in 
CHEMICAL PROCESSES 
INSTEAD OF FOSSIL FUELS the upper part of our building and this was the first 
step towards the use of increasingly clean energy 
resources.
