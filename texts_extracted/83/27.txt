ROTECTION OF THE
     
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH
     
WE LIVE AND OPERATE 
We pursue a model of sustainable development and consider the 
protection  of  the  environment  in  which  we  live  and  operate  a 
fundamental  aspect  for  our  business.  We  do  everything  that  is 
reasonable and effective to minimise the negative effects of our 
activities  on  the  environment  and  comply  with  environmental 
protection laws and directives.  
Our headquarters are located in one of the most beautiful regions in 
the  world  for  its  landscapes  and  biodiversity:  Tuscany.  Here,  the 
environmental heritage is a fundamental actor towards which we 
have always had great respect and care. During our operations we 
support  the  protection  and  promotion  of  sustainable  practices  in 
order  to  avoid  the  loss  of  biodiversity  and  the  degradation  of 
ecosystems.
