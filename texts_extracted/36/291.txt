since they are reported under Scope 2.
(7)  In terms of minor pollutants, mercury emissions in 2019 amounted to 109 kg, associated with thermoelectric generation for Italy, Spain, Russia and 
Chile, which account for almost 100% of coal-fired thermoelectric generation throughout the Group. This is in addition to the mercury emissions 
from the geothermal sector amounting to 403 kg. In Europe, mercury emissions are declared to the competent authorities for registration in the 
European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) in accordance with EU Regulation no. 166/2006 and are subject to the relevant checks 
in terms of completeness, consistency and credibility (Article 2 of Regulation no. 166/2006).
(8)  The 2019 and 2018 data was classified according to a different method from that applied in 2017. The figures are therefore not comparable.
(9)  The increase recorded in 2019 is mainly due to penalties imposed on the distribution company in Spain.
(10) Following the adoption of the new standard GRI 303 in the 2018 data reporting, the figure previously indicated as specific consumption now 
refers to specific requirements. Requirement means the total amount of water withdrawn, including the re-use of external wastewater, which is 
necessary for the plants to operate. This figure does not include water used for open-cycle cooling, since the water is then put back into the original 
water body.
(11) Specific requirements for thermoelectric generation are calculated considering the total consumption of water from thermoelectric generation, in 
proportion to the total thermoelectric generation (including the contribution of heat in MWh).
(12) Specific requirements for nuclear power generation are calculated considering total water consumption from nuclear generation, in proportion to 
the total nuclear power generation.
(13) Specific requirements for total generation are calculated considering the total water consumption for thermoelectric and nuclear generation, in 
proportion to the total thermoelectric (including the heat contribution in MWh), renewable and nuclear generation.
(14) Following the adoption of the standard GRI 303, since 2019 the figures relating to the withdrawal classes by water source are divided into fresh 
water (= < 1,000 mg/l total dissolved solids) and other water (> 1,000 mg/l total dissolved solids). This division is not available for previous years.
(15) The difference in the 2019 figure from the previous year is due to a different data collection method following the introduction of a new environmen-
tal data tool. The figures were gathered by adopting the withdrawal classes and discharges according to the new standard GRI 303.
(16) Following the adoption of the new standard GRI 303, as of 2019 the figures relating to discharges were collected by destination. This division is not 
available for previous years.

(18) The cabling ratio is calculated by proportioning the km of cabled lines (both underground and aerial insulated cables) to the total km of lines. The 
increase in the cabling ratio over the years is due to a general increase, in terms of length, of aerial and underground cable sections at the expense 
of the bare conductor line.
