Circular economy
The Enel Group has begun to implement a “Circular Procurement” strategy for the purchase of goods, works or ser-
vices to minimise and/or avoid negative environmental impacts and waste creation during their life cycle.
The strategy is based on three key pillars: 
1) involving suppliers: developing a reward system by adopting speciﬁc instruments in the tender phase to encourage 
a commitment to the circular economy;
2) establishing metrics and KPIs: quantifying, evaluating and validating environmental KPIs resulting from a product’s 
manufacturing cycle; 
3) co-innovation: launching co-innovation projects together with suppliers in order to review production processes 
and/or amend purchase methods in accordance with circular economy models.
The “Circular Economy Initiative for Suppliers’ Engagement” project involves about 200 suppliers globally in 12 mer-
chandise categories, which currently account for more than 60% of spending for the purchase of materials. The ini-
tiative is based on adopting the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) with the aim of quantifying, certifying and 
objectively communicating the impacts generated throughout the supplies’ lifecycle (water consumption, CO, impact 
2
on soil, etc.). 
Lastly, by adopting a dedicated IT tool (the Circular Supplier Tool), it is possible to aggregate data and set industry 
benchmarks and improvement targets.
