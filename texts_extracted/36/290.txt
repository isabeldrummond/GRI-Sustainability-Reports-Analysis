(1)  Avoided emissions are calculated as the sum of the emissions avoided in the various countries. The resulting figure is the product of the generation 
of electricity obtained from a renewable or nuclear source and the specific CO emissions from the thermoelectric generation of the country where 
2
Enel operates (source: Enerdata - http://enerdata.net).
(2)  For all combustion processes from fossil sources, the production of NO (GWP = 265) and CH (GWP = 28) expressed in CO equivalent are inclu-

ded. These values, not present in the 2017 and 2018 reporting, were recalculated for the previous two years. The calculation of the other activities 
also includes CO  emissions from the combustion of diesel fuel in the generating sets, from the fuel of the company fleet, from the fuel used in 
2eq
the offices for heating and canteens, fluorinated gases and ODS, SF and NF.

(3)  This indicator is calculated as the ratio between total emissions from thermoelectric generation and the total from renewable, nuclear and thermo-
electric generation (including the contribution of heat in MWh ).

(4)  “Scope 2”, emissions from energy taken from the grid: indirect CO emissions relating to 2019 due to the consumption of electricity for moving 
2
fuel, electricity distribution, property management and electricity purchased from the grid by hydroelectric plants are calculated as the product of 
the electricity consumption multiplied by the respective weighted specific CO emission coefficients of the whole generation mix of the countries 
2
where the Enel Group operates (source: Enerdata - https://www.enerdata.net/). The data for 2019 also includes the total share of energy taken from 
the grid for power generation for Italy. The 2018 and 2017 data has been recalculated to include this figure. Scope 2 is calculated according to the 
“location based” method (based on the company’s location). It is the result of the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from electricity 
generation in the area where the consumption takes place. This figure is obtained by multiplying a company’s electricity consumption (expressed 
in kWh) within the borders of the country in question and the average CO emissions per kWh at the specific country level. Scope 2 is calculated 
2
according to the “market based” method (based on the market where the company operates). For companies operating in European countries, 
the reference market is the European one (EU). Companies can obtain this figure by calculating the emissions caused by the power plants that 
supply them. The electricity’s origin must be certified by “contractual instruments that meet the minimum quality criteria”. In Europe, the only way 
to prove the electricity’s origin is the Guarantees of Origin. Companies that use electricity whose origin is not certified by these Guarantees must 
perform the calculation by referring to the emissions associated with the residual mix (source: Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, 2015).
(5)  “Scope 2”, emissions from energy losses from Enel’s distribution grid and the electricity system transmission grid: as of this year, this category 
includes indirect emissions deriving from technical losses from Enel’s distribution grid, calculated for all countries of operation for 2017-2019. With 
its business, the Group covers the entire generation and sales chain in Europe (Italy and Spain) and in five Latin American countries (Argentina, 
Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Peru). To calculate emissions, it has been assumed that the vertical chain of activities takes place within the country. The 
emissions caused by the losses were calculated based on the part of energy that exceeds the quota produced in the considered country, to avoid 
the double accounting of emissions already included in Scope 1. An additional division was made for the fraction distributed and sold by Enel in 
the retail market – a share for which transmission losses were also calculated – and for the share distributed on behalf of other market companies. 
(6)  “Scope 3”: indirect CO emissions for 2019 resulting from the transportation of coal by sea are estimated based on the quantity transported (equi-
2
valent to 66.6% of the total coal used), taking into consideration the Panamax ships with a 67,600 t capacity, which cover average distances of 700 
nautical miles in 22 days, consuming 35 t of fuel oil a day, and an emission coefficient of 3.2 kg of CO per litre of oil consumed, considering also the 
2
3-day stopover for unloading for which there is a consumption of 5 t of fuel oil. Indirect CO emissions from rail transportation of coal are estimated 
2
based on the quantity transported (equivalent to 33.4% of the coal used) and taking into consideration trains with a capacity of 1,100 t, which cover 
average distances of 1,400 km with consumption of 6.9 kWh/t for every 100 km transported and an average Enel emission coefficient worldwide. 
Indirect CO emissions from the transportation of consumable materials, fuel oil, gas oil, solid biomass, WDF and waste are estimated based on 
2
the quantities of raw materials transported, taking into consideration trucks with a capacity of 28 t, which cover average (round trip) distances of 75 
km with a consumption of 1 litre of diesel for every 3 km travelled and an emission coefficient of 3 kg of CO for each litre of gas oil consumed. The 
2
figure is a rough estimate of the fugitive methane emissions (CH) from coal imported and used by the Enel Group for thermoelectric generation.

The figure does not take into account emissions due to the transportation of lignite. In terms of the use of the product sold by end customers for 
the gas market, the figure for emissions from the combustion of natural gas is calculated based on the energy amount (TWh) of gas sold multiplied 
by its emission factor (source: IPCC for CO, NO and CH); to calculate emissions from the use of the electricity sold, it has been assumed that 
2 2 4
the vertical chain of activities takes place within the same country. The emissions of the share sold and produced by the Company have not been 
included in the calculation since they already fall under Scope 1. The share for the fraction sold but not produced by country was calculated by mul-
tiplying the energy amount by the specific country-level emission (source: Enerdata). Emissions from grid losses are not included in the calculation
