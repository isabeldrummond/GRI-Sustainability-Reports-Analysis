Enel Green Power: GIS - the hydroelectrical portal  
Hydro-electrical technology is amongst the renewable energy sources which can signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from using a 
platform and geo-location analytical tools given that energy production is closely linked to geographical parameters, 
to meteorological data, to the overall management of water resources, including for emergency scenarios, and to the 
context of civil and territorial works.
Enel Green Power has developed the ﬁrst GIS Portal (Geographic Information System) to implement and maintain its 
hydroelectric power stations. This creates a uniﬁed geographic framework to store, process, analyse and submit various 
types of data with geography as the key information variable. This portal will be able to assist decision-making processes.
All the data is organised into thematic “layers” in relation to the position and the geometry of the digitalized asset and 
correlated with the GIS information collected through well-established technologies such as satellites, drones, lasers, 
scanners. Notably, the GIS portal for O&M Hydro is grouped into four categories:
>  assets: here the applications are for the digital mapping of the power stations, providing a revision functionality of 
the power plant components, cadastral data and geographical analyses;
>  Hydro Plants Monitoring: the applications developed here are specialised and operational and carry out monitoring 
based on the parameters for hydroelectric power plants. Specialist applications serve to facilitate the correlation of 
the geo-service data into “theme” layers with the hydroelectric assets and they are mainly focused on: management 
of emergencies, risk evaluation, geology, hydrology, environmental information and meteorological data. 
The operational applications are: geo-data processing to calculate and map water courses and their hydrographic 
basins, to collect and analyse the data of the basins and a personalised application to record changes – “Change 
Detection” – for the purposes of comparing the satellite images with various timestamps provided by the European 
satellite service Sentinel, correlated with the position of the water resource asset;
>  drones: used to collect and process the data collected from drone inspections. This data is then published on 
the GIS portal for further analysis and for the “Change Detection” techniques to be applied in consecutive ﬂights 
in order to identify any changes in the assets themselves or on the ground, and to pre-empt any potential risk 
scenarios;
>  specialist inspections: to collect GIS data from speciﬁcally innovative projects such as GPR inspections (Ground 
Penetrating Radar), geological data monitoring of landslides in real-time using IoT sensors in the ﬁeld as well as laser 
scanner data.
An online GIS software is in the process of being developed and will be dedicated to production process planning, in 
addition to managing emergency events 72 hours in advance using predictions to calculate incoming volumes into the 
hydrographic basins where the Group’s hydroelectric power stations are located. This speciﬁc module will be able to both 
model the terrain in terms of type, levels of humidity and other relevant variables, using the Enel Green Power inﬂow/
outﬂow model, as well as providing projections on the availability of the water resources using hourly meteorological 
forecast data.
