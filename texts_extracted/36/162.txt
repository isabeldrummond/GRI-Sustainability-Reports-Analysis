so-called “Library” which lists the “sustainability Ks” to be

used in tender processes by the different purchasing units in 
line with the various MCs. There are three main categories

Integrity requirements
Since 2016, new operating practices have been established and adopted at Group level in terms of checks on sup-
pliers’ “integrity requirements” with the aim of consolidating the existing control system through more rigorous 
action to tackle corruption, particularly by: setting out speciﬁc documentary check criteria for legal and integrity requi-
rements that are homogeneous and applicable to the procurement process (from the assessment phase through to 
awarding individual contracts); identifying the operating modes for checks to enhance the preventive tools available 
and have a rational, organic and determined impact on any cases of corruption or on factors contributing to its spread; 
promoting a widespread culture of compliance and ethics. An Artiﬁcial Intelligence System was later integrated into 
the system as a tool to analyse and mitigate reputational, environmental and social risks, etc. in order to select and 
constantly monitor suppliers by checking open sources.
