Direct and indirect GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions
The trend of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions over the past years, in line with the GHG protocol, is provided below.

1 The methodology and sources considered for calculating greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, 2, 3) are detailed in the following paragraph. The values f  or 2018 
and 2017 were modiﬁed by adding the new calculation categories introduced in 2019. The Scope 2 emissions for electricity purchased from the grid were 
recalculated due to the expansion of the calculation basis. Regarding the year-over-year data comparison and the relative sums, the ﬁgures shown in the table 
regarding year-over-year data comparison and subset additions are calculated considering decimal digits that may not be disclosed in the table.
2 For all combustion processes from fossil sources, the production of NO (GWP = 265) and CH (GWP = 28) expressed in CO equivalent are included. These 
2 4 2
values, not present in the 2017 and 2018 reporting, were recalculated for the previous two years. The calculation of the other activities also includes CO equi-
2
valent emissions from the combustion of diesel fuel in the generating sets, from the fuel of the company ﬂeet, from the fuel used in the ofﬁces for heating and 
canteens, ﬂuorinated gases and ODS, SF and NF.

3 The values do not include the emissions from technical losses of the Enel distribution grid, which were calculated only as location based.
4 Avoided emissions are calculated as the sum of the emissions avoided in the different countries where Enel is present. The resulting value is the product of 
the generation of electricity obtained from a renewable or nuclear sources and the speciﬁc CO emissions from the thermoelectric generation of the country in

which Enel is present.
