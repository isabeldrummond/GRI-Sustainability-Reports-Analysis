Enel X Circular Economy Client Report
During 2019, the first seven Circular Economy Client Report were finalised.

For public administration, Enel X has developed a new assessment model aimed at assessing the level of energy  en
p

circularity of municipalities on two levels: at city level and specific site level.  A
& 
For cities, the assessment covers five areas: circular economy, energy, mobility, waste, emissions. Each of these  d

areas is assessed on the basis of four dimensions:  n 
e
>  governance & policy (existence of local targets and plans to promote the circular economy and related issues);  Gre
>  support tools (promotion of municipal initiatives and incentives aimed at promoting circularity towards citizens and 
the private sector);
>  digitalization (integration of digital tools to enable, promote or facilitate the adoption of circular behaviour by citizens 
and the private sector);
>  status quo (assessment of the current status and targets achieved on items related to the circular economy).
For the specific site, the assessment focuses on the energy aspects of the building under analysis. In particular, the as-
sessment areas are: renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy management, circularity enablers (for example, 
network services, electric mobility solutions).
The first complete Circular Economy Report pilot dedicated to public administration was the one produced for the 
Municipality of Serrenti (South Sardinia) and its school; a small Sardinian municipality that won the Cresco Award 
in 2018, as it is rated as one of the Italian municipalities that is investing most in the renewable energy and smart grids 
sector. In addition to the Report the municipality was also supplied with a citizens’ annex, a booklet containing a simple 
summary of the main findings of the Report.
