Enel X: a constantly evolving circularity laboratory 
At a Glance
  
Enel X is a circularity accelerator within its ecosystem of suppliers, partners, installers and customers. The aim is to 
speed up circularity through the Circular Economy Boosting Program, which is not only applied to portfolio solutions, 
generating a verified score, but also provides for industrial and public administration customers to obtain an Energy Cir-
cularity Report, which measures energy circularity and identifies a structured roadmap to increase it by implementing 
a series of innovative solutions. 
More information about the process is available on the dedicated website at: https://www.enelx.com/it/en/circular-econ-
omy.
The starting point for the Circular Economy Boosting Program is the Circular Economy Score, which allows the degree 
of circularity of the solutions in the portfolio to be measured. 51 solutions have already been evaluated in 4 countries 
relating to: public lighting in Italy, Spain, Chile and Colombia; public and private recharging, juice lamp, residential photo-
voltaic, storage systems, residential boiler and solar thermal in Italy; residential air conditioning in Italy and Chile. Sample 
results are available at www.enelx.com and www.enelxstore.com.
In 20 cases, based on these assessments, specific “circular intelligence” activities were carried out (analysis of the 
market context, scouting of innovations and startups) in order to identify opportunities to enhance the circularity of the 
various solutions, effectively completing the Circular Economy Boosting Program.
Furthermore, in 2019, Enel X undertook to start various projects related to the circularity pillars, including:
>  “product as a service” - Second Life Platform as a Service: Enel X offers its customers in Italy innovative energy 
service solutions linked to the reuse of photovoltaic panels previously partially used in the Enel value chain; 
>  “extension of useful life” - regeneration of juice pole replacement parts: working with its suppliers, Enel X has 
introduced recovery and regeneration processes for the functioning spare parts of juice poles, with the aim of reus-
ing them for maintenance and repair both in Italy and Spain; similar processes will also be applied in Latin America.
