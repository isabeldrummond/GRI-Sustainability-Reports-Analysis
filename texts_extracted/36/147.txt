1 This rate is calculated by establishing the ratio between the number of injuries (all injuries, also those with 3 days of absence or less) and hours worked/1,000,000.
2 Sum of: injuries that resulted in more than 6 months’ absence from work as at December 31, 2019; injuries that are still open and considered severe (initial progno-
sis > 30 days) as at December 31, 2019; injuries categorised as “Life Changing Accidents” (LCAs), regardless of the resulting days of absence from work.
3 The Lost Time Injuries Frequency Rate is calculated by relating the number of injuries (all accident events, also those with 3 days of absence or less) with hours 
worked * 200 thousand.
4 Considering all areas in which the Group operates and the activities managed, including companies consolidated using the equity method and companies for which 
the BSO (Build, Sell and Operate) mechanism has been applied, the total number of fatalities is 8.
