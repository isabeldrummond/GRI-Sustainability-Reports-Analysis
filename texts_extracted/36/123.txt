determine and classify the Company’s contribution towards the 
development of the communities where it is present.
In particular, according to the LBG standard, the expense for the 
contributions to the communities can be divided as follows:
>  donations: pro bono contributions and without obliga-
tions for the beneficiaries, except that they have to use 
the donation for charitable purposes and for non-profit 
associations. For Enel, this item includes all the mone-
tary and “in kind” charitable donations, including those 
for philanthropic and solidarity activities;
>  investments in the community: medium-long term involve-
ment in community support projects, also in partnership 
with local organisations, targeted towards facing signifi-
cant problems both for the local area as well as for the 
Company. This category includes, for example, projects 
related to a wider strategy to the benefit of the commu-
nity, such as “Access to electricity”, or specific initiatives 
dedicated to the communities near the power plants;
>  commercial initiatives with a social impact: contributes to 
activities connected to the core business, in which the 
Company promotes its own brand and its own corporate 
identity. Examples of these initiatives are the marketing 
campaigns that also provide benefits for the community, 
or that include contributions for charitable purposes.
