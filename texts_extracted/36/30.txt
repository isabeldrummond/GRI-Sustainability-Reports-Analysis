Alliance for the Circular Economy 
A circularity-based business model implies the utmost collaboration among all actors involved; that’s why we considered it to 
be essential to open up to dialogue with parties that share our vision, involving the chains and promoting common initiatives 
to safeguard natural resources and boost competitiveness of the country. In 2017 Enel launched the Alliance for the Circular 
Economy and signed a Declaration of Intent with companies in the Made in Italy sector, occupying leading positions in a range 
of manufacturing sectors. The goal of the Alliance is to guide a global evolution of the manufacturing scenario from a circular per-
spective that promotes the unique features of Made in Italy products, focusing on innovation, aiding the sharing of experiences 
and best practices and stimulating constant dialogue with the entire ecosystem. In 2019, an increasing level of interest for the 
initiative allowed the Alliance to achieve ever greater participation in terms of the number of companies involved and sectors 
represented, in such a way as to increase the level of support for the development of circular business models.
