1 Target prior to redeﬁnition and certiﬁcation by the Science Based Targets initiative, which took place in September 2019. Following this redeﬁnition, the new 
target for reducing CO emissions by 2030 is equal to 125 gCO/kWh . 
2 2 eq
2 The value only considers the consolidated capacity. In relation to the overall value of the capacity managed, CO emissions amount to 284 gCO/kWh .

3 This includes acquisitions amounting to 0.2 GW and 0.4 GW of managed capacity.
4 Target redeﬁned based on only the scope of Enel X.
5 Includes the contribution of the Global Power Generation Business Line.
6 The target for reducing CO emissions by 2030 was redeﬁned and certiﬁed by the Science Based Targets initiative in September 2019. Following this redeﬁni-
2
tion, in 2022 the speciﬁc emissions of CO will be lower than 220 gCO/kWh .
