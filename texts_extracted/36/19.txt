>	 Economic and financial value cre-
ation – The creation of economic 
value is essential for the Group’s 
enduring survival and its long-term 
sustainability. In this context, the 
Company’s  financial  performance 
is among the material issues for 
both stakeholders and the Group. In 
2019, Enel posted a gross operat-
ing margin of 17.7 billion euros and 
distributed a minimum dividend per 
share of 0.33 euros, representing 
an increase with respect to 2018.
>	 Decarbonization  of  the  energy 
mix  –  The  fight  against  climate 
change has become one of the key 
challenges  facing  companies.  In 
particular, in the utilities sector this 
has led to the development of regu-
lations and public policies aimed at 
promoting a global zero emissions 
economy, in which electrification of 
the energy demand plays a key role. 
Institutional investors are devoting 
ever greater attention to the man-
agement and results of companies 
in relation to climate change. In this 
context, Enel has defined specific 
objectives to reduce emissions of 
greenhouse gases (GHG), focusing 
on growth of renewable capacity 
and gradual closure of coal pow-
er plants. Details of the goals and 
actions  implemented  are  shown 
in the sections dedicated to Enel’s 
commitment to combating climate 
change in the Sustainability Report.
