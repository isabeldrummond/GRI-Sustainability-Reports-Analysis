1 Includes the replacement of smart meters.
2 Includes 13.1 million 2.0 smart meters
3 Since 2019, digitalization investments have been included within total capital expenditure destined for operational efﬁciency. They are therefore no longer repor-
ted separately. 
4 Public and private charging points installed. 
5 Excludes Eletropaulo. The 2019 result including Eletropaulo is 60.1%.
6 Includes the technical losses (Joule effect) and non-technical losses (energy theft) of E-Distribuzione (Italy).
7 Includes 28.8 million 2.0 smart meters
8 Target redeﬁned following the inclusion of Eletropaulo.
