1  Following the adoption of the new GRI 303, from 2018 the values   shown to date as a speciﬁc consumption are indicated as a speciﬁc requirement.
2 Following the deﬁnition of the emission reduction target by 2030, certiﬁed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), these targets were recalculated and 
based on 2017 values to ensure correct consistency and alignment. The 2022 targets compared to baseline year 2017 for SO, NO and dust are respectively 
2 x
-80%, -45%, and -90%.
3 The target set by each country is calculated in relation to the volume of single-use plastic used and refers to 2018.
4 This does not include ofﬁces with less than 20 employees.
