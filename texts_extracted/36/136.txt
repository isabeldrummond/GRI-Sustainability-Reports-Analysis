A printing service has been operating in all Enel ofﬁces for some  d 
n
o
time now. In addition to using new-generation printers, designed  B

for more environmentally friendly use, the service was con- e
Gr
ceived on an advanced business model that has allowed Enel 
2019 136 to evolve from the concept of product to that of service. The 
unique aspects of this service, together with a more rational use 
of printed documents and digitalization, have led to a reduction 
in paper consumption over the years and consequently a lower 
tCO produced impact on the environment. In particular, based on the number 
2
of printed pages and the printers’ technical speciﬁcations, the 
2017 19.0 quantity of CO associated with the electricity consumption of 
2
printers while printing is calculated by applying each country’s 
emission coefﬁcient (data source: Enerdata), which takes into 
2018 15.7
account the speciﬁc mix of energy sources present1.
