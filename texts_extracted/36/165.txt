Suppliers of solid and liquid fuel are selected through the  Fuel purchases (mil euros)
“Know Your Customer” process, which evaluates each 
party’s reputational and financial aspects and possession  2017 1,611
of the appropriate technical and commercial requirements. 
It is also checked that the suppliers are not on any specif-
834
ic “Black Lists” of the United Nations, European Union or 
OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control).

sociated with terrorist associations, organisations under

nated Nationals (SDNs) which are subject to United States  2018 (1) 2,024

To assess the sustainability aspects of coal sources, an 
internal process has been established to prove that the 
1,698
requirements in line with the Group’s standards on occu-
pational health and safety, environment and human rights 
have been fulfilled. 
Purchase contracts agreed with each supplier are subject  2019 1,952
to the principles adopted by the Group with regard to the 
Code of Ethics and Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan, with 
970
which suppliers must comply. Enel reserves the right to 
terminate contracts in severe cases of non-compliance 
976
with said principles. 
Lastly, to mitigate risks arising from shipping fuels, Enel 
has adopted a tool to vet the carriers it uses. Vetting is 
a recognised industry standard for oil transportation; but 
for a few years now, Enel and an increasing number of  Gas Oil Coal
operators have already begun to apply this method also for 
transporting bulk cargoes. 1 2018 value was recalculated to reﬂect a methodology update.
