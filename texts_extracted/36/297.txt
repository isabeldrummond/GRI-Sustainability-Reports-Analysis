(1)  The 2017 and 2018 data has been updated following a change in methodology. The final figure as at December 31 in the year in question has been 
reported in place of the average figure published in the 2018 Sustainability Report. 
(2)  The park efficiency was calculated assuming the operation of the plants at load level, where there is maximum efficiency for those plants for which 
the load curve is available. This assumption has not been applied to the heat component since it is already high efficiency; the availability was 
calculated by reducing the causes of internal unavailability.
(3)  Some 2017 and 2018 figures have been updated.
(4)  The figure is calculated on a scale of 1 to 100. For 2019, the values have been estimated on the basis of established trends. Following a change of 
methodology, as of 2018, the CSI (Customer Satisfaction Index) amount is determined annually rather than half-yearly as it was in 2017. 
(5)  The increase in the 2019 amount compared to 2018 is related to the migration of data to SAP, which took place at the beginning of 2019. The com-
plexity of the process generated backlogs.
(6)  The figure is calculated on a scale of 1 to 100. The fall recorded on the free market in 2019 relates to the replacement of the customer management 
IT platform with a more advanced one (SAP platform). The learning curve of the telephone operators was reflected in the quality of service provided.
(7)  The 2017 and 2018 figures include a more specific determination of the amounts.
(8)  The fall recorded in 2019 relates to the replacement of the customer management IT platform with a more advanced one (CRM Sales Force). The 
learning curve of the telephone operators has been reflected in the quality of service provided.
