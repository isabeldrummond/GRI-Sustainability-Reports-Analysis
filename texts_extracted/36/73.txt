1   Following Enel’s adoption of the new GRI 303 in 2018, requirements refer to the total amount of water withdrawn, including reuse of wastewater, necessary for 
plant operation. The speciﬁc requirement for total generation is calculated considering the total water consumption for thermoelectric and nuclear generation, 
compared to total thermoelectric (including the heat contribution in MWh), renewable and nuclear generation. This value does not include the water used for 
open-cycle cooling, which is returned to the original body of water. Consumption is calculated as the difference between the water withdrawn and the water 
returned.
2   The World Resources Institute (WRI) has deﬁned a “Water Stressed Area” as an area where the annual amount of water available per capita is less than 1,700 m3.
