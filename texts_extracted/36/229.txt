Enel performs a speciﬁc human rights due diligence process 
on the entire value chain in the various countries where it op-
erates. Speciﬁcally, the process was developed in line with 
best international practices and includes four phases:  
PHASE MAIN RESULTS 2017-2019
Analysis of risk perceived by key stakeholders, at individual country  The analysis showed that issues relating to bribery and environmental im-
level, with regard to labour rights, local community rights and envi- pacts are a “high priority risk” assessment, that requires companies to 
ronment rights adopt advanced monitoring and management mechanisms.
Gap assessment to identify and analyse organisational and risk con- The policies, procedures, systems and practices in place in the Group in 
trol systems each area of the value chain have been assessed by analysing over 100 
indicators. The results showed that Enel has a set of robust mechanisms 
and management systems, which ensure respect for human rights and 
adequately manage existing risks.
Development of improvement plans Around 160 actions have been planned, covering 100% of operations and 
sites.
Monitoring improvement plans At the end of 2019, over 90% of actions were completed. For the remain-
ing 10% approximately, some actions will be completed in 2020 as part 
of larger processes or due to external factors (such as the social crisis in 
Chile), while others have been removed as they are no longer necessary 
following organisational changes.
