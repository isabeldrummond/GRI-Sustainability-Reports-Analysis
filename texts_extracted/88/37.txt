SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS 
(SDGS) 
In this document, it was deemed appropriate 
to link the SDGs that could be related directly 
to the main topics presented, from the 17 
Sustainable Development Goals defined by 
the United Nations in 2015 and contained in 
the Sustainable Development Agenda. 
These objectives contain the Guidelines that 
commit  governments  and  international 
economic  actors  to  achieving  specific 
environmental, social and economic targets 
by 2030.  
These links were established by analytically 
comparing the 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) with the material topics and the 
Group's characteristic activities and services.   
The  following  11  sustainable  development 
objectives were identified on the basis of this 
analysis.
