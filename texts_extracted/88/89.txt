Sustainability Report 2019 - Mediaset Group – 4 ▪ Effectiveness and sustainability of the broadcasting and commercial offering 
In  order  to  avoid  any  proceedings  for 
misleading  advertising,  Mediaset  España 
voluntarily  submits  any  doubtful  case  in 
advance  to  the  Association  for  the  Self-
Regulation  of  Commercial  Communication 
(Autocontrol). 1,419 requests for an opinion in 
advance were submitted to Autocontrol in 
2019. 
The  internal  monitoring  process  of 
advertising  content  also  provides  further 
verification, even after airing (in the event of 
disputes or claims for compensation). 
The  Mediaset  Group  in  Spain  performs 
further reviews to regulate televised content 
for  children;  this  monitoring  and  control 
includes issues regarding the advertisement 
of  certain  food  products  (to  prevent 
obesity),  messages  on  the  environment, 
advertising  toys,  and  the  promotion  of 
medicinal products or alcoholic beverages. 
Further compliance checks are carried out 
with  regard  to  advertising  spots  for  the 
gambling and betting sector.
