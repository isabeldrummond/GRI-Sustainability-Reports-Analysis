36 The specific provision has been confirmed in the new Code of Ethics adopted by Mediaset S.p.A. and its subsidiaries in 2019: Art. 26 (Environmental protection) "1. The Mediaset Group considers protecting the environment 
to be a key factor in the company and is inspired by the principles of respect for and protection of the environment and the local territory, due both to their intrinsic value and their impact on the health of humans and other 
living species. To this end, the Mediaset Group is committed to observing the regulations in force and works so that all its business activity complies with the highest standards of environmental safety and compatibility.  
2. Particular attention is dedicated to the collection and disposal of waste produced by the company, which wherever possible is treated according to the principles of selective separation and recycling of waste, to reduce the 
impact on the environment to a minimum and as required by current laws and best operating practices."
