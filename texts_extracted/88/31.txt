MAPPING OF STAKEHOLDERS AND 
MATERIALITY ANALYSIS 
In  keeping  with  the  reporting  principles 
drawn up by the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI),  the  first  Sustainability  Report  was 
drawn up, involving the principal company 
departments,  using  a  structured  analysis 
designed  to  identify  the  key  stakeholders 
and  the  most  material  topics  for  the 
preparation of the Report. 
For the purposes of sustainability reporting, 
topics deemed material, or significant, are 
those  of  an  economic,  social  and 
environmental nature on which a business 
has a significant effect (positive or negative) 
and  which  may  substantially  affect  the 
assessments and decisions of stakeholders. 
The materiality analysis therefore takes into 
consideration not only the perspective of the 
organisation but also that of the stakeholders 
 
themselves.
