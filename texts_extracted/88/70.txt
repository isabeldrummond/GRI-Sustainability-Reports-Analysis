Every year, the audit function performs risk 
analyses linked to corruption within the most 
important business lines of the Group. These 
activities are an integral part of the Annual 
Audit Plan. To this regard, in 2019 all the 
corporate  structures  of  the  Group  were 
examined.  Specifically,  the  Internal  Audit 
function  performed  various  audits  on  the 
most significant processes whose results did 
not reveal any issues. In 2019, just like in 2018, 
there were no episodes of corruption that 
involved the Group, and it was not therefore 
necessary to undertake any action in this 
field.
