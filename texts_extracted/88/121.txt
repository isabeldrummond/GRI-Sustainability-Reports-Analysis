 Sustainability Report 2019 - Mediaset Group – 5 ▪ People 
Based  on  the  objectives  set  out  in  the 
prevention plan, each year the SPM defines 
the activity plan. The Risk Officer has the task 
of approving and monitoring the plan on a 
quarterly basis together with the Health and 
Safety Committee. The committee therefore 
does not carry out preventive activities but 
rather  represents  all  employees:  the 
committee consists of approx. ten people 
belonging  to  the  different  professional 
categories. Moreover, the SPM can perform 
extraordinary activities to meet or adapt to 
new regulatory needs or changes in business 
activities.  3  cases  of  accidents  involving 
external personnel were identified in 2019, 
resulting in an occupational rate of injury of 
8.8.    
In 2019, as in the two previous years, there 
were  no  cases  of  injuries  or  cases  of 
occupational illness in other foreign Mediaset 
Group companies.
