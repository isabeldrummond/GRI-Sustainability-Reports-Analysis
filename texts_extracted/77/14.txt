Having identified its significant stakeholders, the Group conducted a materiality analysis in compliance with the “G4 
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines” established in 2013 by the GRI – Global Reporting Initiative. The materiality 
analysis has brought numerous benefits to the organization, such as a greater awareness of the environmental and 
social issues considered significant and the opportunity to set new objectives for the future, reflecting on how to 
fully integrate sustainability issues in its strategy and growth.
The results of the analysis are summarized in the materiality matrix shown below. In particular:
•  each point on the matrix represents a material issue to be reported in this document;
