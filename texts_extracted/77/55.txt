Energy consumption
For a production-based organization like Isagro, energy consumption is a particularly important aspect, closed linked 
to its business activities. In relation to this, the Group strictly respects the national and international legislation in 
force and undertakes to monitor the consumption of energy in its production processes periodically, with a view to 
achieving a continual improvement.
Isagro’s energy consumption in 2016 was almost 208,000 GJ13 , recording a decrease of 13%14 with respect to the 
previous year. This decrease is, in part, attributable to some projects implemented by the Group at the plants of Panoli 
and Bussi, with a view to reducing their energy consumption and improving their manufacturing processes in terms of 
energy efficiency. In Panoli, for example, new water cooling technologies have been implemented and the installation 
of new technical devices has reduced the losses in the remote cooling process.
As can be seen from the chart below, the largest part of the Group’s energy consumption comes from the use of 
natural gas, as a non-renewable fuel for its manufacturing process, which, in 2016 represented 60% of its overall 
consumption, as against 31% attributed to the purchase of electricity.
With regard to the Group’s electricity consumption, it is pointed out that over 70% is attributable to the electricity 
requirement of the Italian plants while the remaining amount is attributable to the Indian plant of Panoli.
Finally, it is pointed out that the reduction in energy consumption between the two years analysed, is also attributable 
to the production downtime at the Italian plant of Bussi in the last few months of 2016.

As can be seen from the chart, a limited amount of energy, equivalent to 0.3% of total consumption, is attributable to 
the use of a local district cooling system at the Indian plant.
