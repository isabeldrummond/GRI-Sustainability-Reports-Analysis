 
Atmospheric emissions
In 2016, the Group produced a total of 16,640 tonnes of CO15, with a decrease of about 12% with respect to 2015.

These carbon dioxide emissions can be broken down as follows:
Scope 1 – Direct emissions associated with proprietary sources or under the control of the companies in the Group, 
such as fuels used for heating and for the work vehicles necessary for the Group’s activities.
Scope 2 – Indirect emissions associated with the generation of energy purchased and subsequently consumed at 
the Group’s plants. 
In 2016, the direct CO  emissions (Scope 1 emissions) were 8,175 tonnes, recording a decrease of over 15%16 with 
2
respect to the previous year. The indirect CO  emissions (Scope 2 emissions) amounted to 8,465 tonnes, again with 
2
a reduction compared to 2015, albeit lower, equivalent to about 8%.

emission factors (approach adopted for India).
