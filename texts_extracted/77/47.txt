The supply chain
58% of purchases represented by  99% local purchases in India and 
active pharmaceutical substances 45% local purchases in Italy 
The Group’s main activity is the innovative research, development, production and marketing on a worldwide scale 
of Agropharmaceuticals and nutritional products, both belonging to the Group and to third-party organizations.
The organizational model adopted by the Group for carrying out these activities (called the “value chain”) consists 
of the following main phases, listed in short below, separate from, but linked to one another:
•  innovative research
•  development
•  production
•  distribution

In relation to this, the Group uses high-quality raw materials  and ingredients, including Active ingredients and 
Co-formulants conforming to adequate quality specifications and purchased regularly from selected suppliers. 
In order to avoid supply problems due to this supplier selection, with a consequent increase in purchasing costs, the 
Group continually selects new suppliers with a view to identifying a larger number of sources and thus stimulating 
competition between them. In particular, Isagro S.p.A. and Isagro Asia qualify new suppliers on the basis of criteria 
concerning their reliability and the formalization of a supply contract with a safeguard clause in compliance with 
the Model 231. With the same supply conditions, however, Isagro S.p.A. gives priority to suppliers that have HSE 
certifications and/or adopt Responsible Care programmes even if these procedures do not imply actual screening
