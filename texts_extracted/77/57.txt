 
Water consumption
Like all other production plants, Isagro’s plants take the water they need to transform raw materials into finished 
products from nature.
The Group’s water consumption in 2016 reached an overall value of 1,209,909 m3, of which more than 70% is 
attributable to the Bussi plant alone. The main supply source, accounting for over 95% of the water consumed, is 
represented by local watercourses and, to a far lesser extent, by wells (2.4%) and water supply systems (2.1%), 
whose consumption is closely linked to the presence of staff on the sites. 
On the farm complex at the Galliera site, there is also an Artesian well but the water drawn from it is not monitored. 
This well is occasionally used to irrigate the farmland.

95,5%  Once  the  water  has  completed  its 
function in the production cycle of the 
Group’s plants, it is released mainly in the form of surface water and, to a lesser degree, through sewage and 
treatment systems. In 2016, the total amount of wastewater produced was 1,157,377 m3, of which 96.6% was 
destined to the surface, 3.3% to treatment and just 0.1% to the sewer19.
