Panoli
The  Panoli  plant  synthesizes  the  most  important  active  ingredients 
manufactured by the Group, and produces intermediates for subsequent 
use  at  other  plants.  In  time,  the  plant  has  developed  a  consolidated 
environmental management strategy, which lies at the basis of numerous 
projects, such as the “Zero wastewater project” for a complete overhaul of 
the liquid effluent treatment systems. The plant obtained ISO 9001:2008 
certification in 2001 and ISO – 14001:2004 certification in 2005. The plant 
also obtained OHSAS 18001:2007 certification in 2011, thus equipping itself 
with an international occupational health and safety system.
In addition to the production plants and the Research Center, there is a field testing site in GALLIERA (BO). The 
Galliera center is an experimental testing center where field tests are carried out to determine the biological efficacy 
of new active ingredients and formulations. It is a center recognized by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry 
Policies for the production of agronomic efficacy data (GEP) and, together with the Department of Environmental 
Fate and Metabolism and the Department of Residue Analysis in Novara, is recognized both by the Ministry of 
Health and the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies for official tests on agropharmaceutical residues.
