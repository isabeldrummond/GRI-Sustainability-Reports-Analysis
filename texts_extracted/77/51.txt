The production flow of each of the Group’s production plants consists of the transformation of raw materials into 
finished products. In managing these activities, Isagro pays particular attention to environmental aspects, from the 
consumption of natural resources to their impact on the surrounding environment, taking the measures and actions 
necessary to monitor the activities potentially harmful for the environment carried out by the Group and to prevent and/
or limit any environmental impacts of the aforesaid activities, and, where necessary, to remedy any damage caused. 
In relation to this, the Isagro Group’s activities are subject to both Italian and European environmental legislation and 
regulations, and those of the non-EU countries in which the Group operates.
