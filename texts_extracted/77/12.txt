The Group’s mission
The Group’s mission is to offer innovative solutions of chemical and biological origin, for the health of crops, with 
absolute respect for the environment and the users and consumers of farm products. Isagro focuses its innovation 
and development projects on farmers and agricultural companies, and their requirements and need to satisfy 
the agricultural food chain with high-quality products. The Group’s ambition is to guarantee food safety through 
sustainable use of our planet’s resources, to produce more and better.
Isagro considers sustainability a value and a commitment that is reflected in behaviour and activities managed 
efficiently and economically so as to guarantee maximum safety, the protection of health and quality of the 
production process with full respect for the environment. In a world in which it has become important to reconcile 
development and the available resources, growth and needs of the future generations, Isagro commits itself every 
day to combat the shortage of food and nutritional problems above all in densely populated countries with limited 
economic resources.
