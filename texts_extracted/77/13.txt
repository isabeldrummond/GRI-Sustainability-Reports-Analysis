Stakeholder mapping and Materiality analysis
Isagro considers sustainability an integral part of its business strategy, based on a responsible approach that takes 
account of the balance between the organization, the areas in which it operates and the local communities.
•  The strategy adopted by Isagro has the objective of creating value for the Group’s stakeholders, meeting the 
market’s needs and taking advantage of the new opportunities that arise from a correct management of people 
and the environment.
•  To this aim, in 2017, Isagro conducted its first materiality analysis, which involved the main corporate functions, 
in order to strengthen its responsible approach by identifying and giving priority to sustainability issues that 
are important for the Group and its stakeholders. In particular, Isagro identified the material aspects that 
reflect the significant impacts for the organization from the economic, social and environmental points of 
view and substantially influence the assessments and the stakeholders’ decisions. In fact, Isagro believes 
it to be fundamentally important to establish relationships based on trust, respect and collaboration with its 
stakeholders, so as to be able to meet their needs and expectations adequately. In the dynamic and competitive 
scenario in which the Group operates, the ability to predict and anticipate changes in interest or needs is an 
indispensable condition for creating value.
