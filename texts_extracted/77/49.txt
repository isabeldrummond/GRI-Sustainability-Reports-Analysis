The origin of the purchases is particularly important. Where possible, Isagro purchases locally so as to create value for 
the local communities where the Group operates. The data is significant considering that the two companies Isagro 
S.p.A. and Isagro Asia are those that purchase the most raw materials and can be considered the most significant 
operating sites. In 2016, out of a total of € 68.4 million, over half the purchases come from suppliers considered local 
(€ 38.4 million).
