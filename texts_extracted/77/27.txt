Isagro S.p.A. believed in the event right from the beginning for its high intrinsic value and for an objective: to 
promote the Italian culture in the world.
In 2011, the tenth edition of the Festival was celebrated by the President of the Republic conferring a plaque for 
the high cultural value of the event. In 2013, Isagro S.p.A.’s twenty years of business and ten years of listing on the 
stock exchange were celebrated with a concert by the pianist Restani accompanied by La Scala String Quartet: 
the Festival was previewed in the “Salone delle Grida” of the Milan Stock Exchange, in Palazzo Mezzanotte. The 
Festival obtained the Effe 2015-2016 (Europe for Festivals, Festivals for Europe) label, an award given to 761 
festivals in 31 European countries.
