We have established a structured quality management system based on 
procedures that establish the companyâ€™s principle strategic activities, such as 
the  selection  and  qualification  of  suppliers,  key  stakeholders  for 
guaranteeing the quality of our products.
The  selection  parameters  for  suppliers  evaluate  production  quality  and 
capability, geographical area, regulatory compliance and the integrity of their 
working practices. We are committed to maintaining the highest product quality 
standards and to improving them where possible or necessary.
The QP logo that we use in our communications and on packages is 
intended to represents what Quality means to us in practical terms.
The  administrators  together  with  the  technical  director  are  responsible  for 
managing  these  topics.  In  the  following  pages,  we  describe  the  actions, 
projects undertaken and goals for improvement over the next three years.
