STAKEHOLDERS RELATIONS
ur focus on people translates into a relationship approach which respects the 
O
identify  and  nature  of  individuals  and  leads  us  to  build  transparent, 
professional, enduring relationships based on trust and mutual respect.
Engagement is therefore part of our corporate culture to draw value and 
content from the relationships we care about, redistributing these in the form of 
products, company organisation and information we can share.
The activity of involving people (stakeholder engagement) is ingrained and over 
time we have built our company identity on it.
We have therefore identified the groups of stakeholders we consider to be 
significant and with whom we interact, also declaring the method and frequency 
of engagement.
For this 2019 report, we removed publishers and sports people from the list of 
stakeholders, as they are no longer deemed relevant.
We are committed to maintaining two-way relationships with stakeholders to 
make the company more sustainable and competitive; we formalised this 
activity in an official policy drafted in 2018.
The directors managing the involvement of stakeholders relative to this report 
are the BoD and the “Supporters Group”.
In the following pages, we describe the work and the projects undertaken for 
every category of stakeholders.
In  Focus  on  Sustainability  we  report  the  goals  for  improvement  over  a 
three-year period and the progress made to date.

Based on a questionnaire sent in October 2013 to numerous people on our database 
and belonging to various categories, we identified the list of stakeholders we are interested 
in.
This list was revised by the owners during a meeting at the beginning of 2017, bringing it up 
to date according to company needs.
