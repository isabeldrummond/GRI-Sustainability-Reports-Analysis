As a consequence, we pay particular attention to our employees, fundamental 
resources to promote a culture of wellbeing. Some of the services we offer our 
workers are not dictated by regulations and contractual obligations but by 
good will and the knowledge that a comfortable working climate contributes to 
individual wellbeing:
A liveable and stimulating work environment.
Technical and personal training to boost expertise.
Group work to develop a company culture based on shared values and 
transparency.
Smart Working for all employees.
Projects for a work-life balance, above all for maternity leave and the 
family commitments of working mothers.

based on trust and responsibility, with employees no longer required to clock in 
and clock out at work.
