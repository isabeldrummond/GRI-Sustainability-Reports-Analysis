LETTER FROM THE BOD
o be able to meet the challenges of the future facing our market was the goal 
T
we had set ourselves for Pegaso in the latter half of 2018.
2019 was a year of profound, significant changes, given our decision to transfer 
our company shares and seize the opportunity to become part of a major 
German pharmaceutical group: Schwabe.
This decision, taken with the support of our father, the company founder, was 
communicated from the outset to staff at company HQ, who appreciated our 
desire to ensure continuity, development and therefore a sound future for the 
company.
The merger between Pegaso and Schwabe Pharma Italia, the Groupâ€™s Italian 
affiliated company, with two complementary business models and a synergistic 
products catalogue, allowed us to envisage the development of a strategy for 
expanding distribution and strengthening the presence of both brands on the 
Italian market.
Thus, the sustainability process developed over the years by Pegaso will soon 
also  involve  Schwabe  Pharma  Italia  with  a  new  materiality  analysis,  the 
identification of stakeholders and the creation of a new report for the two 
company facilities at Arbizzano (Verona) and Egna (Bolzano).
BoD in office until 6th June 2019
