WATER
e  use  100%  water  from  public  sources  primarily  for  office  utilities  and 
W
sanitation and to water the garden around the company premises; we therefore 
use a limited amount of water and do not impact any source in particular. 
Nonetheless, we do monitor consumption and the factors that influence it, in a 
bid to remain mindful of our impact.
When we originally built the headquarters, we had the foresight to install a 
softener for the water supply, which operates constantly, removing calcium from 
the water. Maintenance is simple and requires the use of salt only. The only pipes

excluded are those for watering the garden.
As we do not use water for production processes but for sanitation only, 
waste water is not recycled nor is it reused or metered.
CONSUMPTION 2019 QUANTITY m3 % 2018 COST â‚¬ % 2018
WATER 1662 +213.6% 1,723.25 +44.5%
The table shows an annual increase in the amount, attributable to various 
factors:
Increased workforce at headquarters.
Increased  washing  of  cups  and  crockery  due  to  introduction  of 
company canteen service.
For 2020, we have decided to base reporting directly on the water meter 
reading, as the water utility bill lacks transparency due to the inclusion of 
adjustments and rebates.
WASTE
he number of pieces handled saw a reduction of 5.88% due to a drop in sales 
T
as well as a further increase in the number of sales of larger size packs; the latter 
improved the ratio between volume handled and net weight of product.
We can report a further downward trend in the volume and weight of waste 
handled. From analysis of these data, it is clear that the high-impact elements 
which  we can  work  on are  those  related  to packaging  and  the waste 
generated by the latter, and this prompts even greater care in the choices we 
TARGET 12.4, 12.5 make.
