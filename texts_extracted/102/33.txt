MATERNITY LEAVE: we keep female employeesâ€™ positions open for their return 
after maternity leave, in accordance with their personal needs after having a 
baby, and breastfeeding requirements: the rate of return to work after parental 
leave to date is 100%.
COMPANY CANTEEN SERVICE: the arrival at headquarters of new colleagues 
from the Egna facility made it necessary to organise a company canteen service. 
The company thus began a collaboration with the Azalea Cooperative, a local 
organisation which works for the greater good of the community. The preparation 
of meals and growing of vegetables is entrusted to disadvantaged people who 
need help to get back into the workplace.
