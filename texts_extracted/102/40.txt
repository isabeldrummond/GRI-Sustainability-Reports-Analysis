MONITORING ACTIVITIES.
This is done in a structured way for medical devices (strictly governed business, 
post-market monitoring) and for dietary supplements. It is done passively - i.e. 
through collection of customer feedback using special forms - and actively 
(for medical devices) through interviews with trade and physicians using 
online questionnaires and telephone calls.
TARGET 12.4, 12.5
PRODUCT ACCESSIBILITY.
Our price policy is aimed at sustainability to make high-quality products 
accessible to the greatest number of people possible. One example of this is 
the introduction of larger size packs, in keeping with the policy of offering 
products at sustainable prices.
LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION. TARGET 3.8
Logistics guarantees the proper storage of the product at every step in the 
supply chain (from the production site to the retail outlet and the final consumer).The 
controlled temperature is kept between 8-25°C while more heat-sensitive products 
are stored in cold rooms at a temperature of 2-8°C, pursuant to art. 16, paragraph 
1, of [Italian] Presidential Decree of 27 January 2012, no. 43.
In summer months (April - September) to protect heat - sensitive products, we 
have introduced controlled-temperature transportation (8-25°C).
CLINICAL TRIALS.
 Clinical studies on final products (in humans) enable the gathering of 
evidence on product efficacy and lead to the publication of trial results in 
specialist scientific journals, which is a valuable and irreplaceable tool in 
our relationship with healthcare operators.
COMPLAINTS-CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.
Checks introduced on packs containing glass vials and on package filling 
% complaints
materials have led to a further reduction in the number of complaints compared 
2019
to 2018. The percentage of complaints, considering the number of pieces sold, 
0.063%
is very low.
