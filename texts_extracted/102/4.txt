aking  up  the  baton  of  an  innovative  and  qualifying  project  such  as  the 
T
Sustainability  Report,  and  succeeding  in  valorising  it  at  both  local  and 
international level is a challenge I am delighted to accept!
At a local level, we used the second half of the year to implement a company 
reorganisation with a view to ensuring a frictionless integration between the two 
companies which will lead to the merger by incorporation during 2020. The 2019 
Report also took into account this forthcoming development, as a result of which 
the Report itself was greatly simplified, paving the way for the inclusion, in the next 
edition, of new data deriving from Schwabe expertise.
At an international level, since our objective will be to suitably convey the value 
of the Report to all our colleagues, we will start drafting it in English too and we will 
present it as a qualifying project for Italy at the Corporate Social Responsibility 
Awards  held  each  year  by  the  Schwabe  Group  to  reward  the  best  social 
responsibility activities run by branches over the past year.
As we await the opportunity to draft a new, more extensive Report for 2020, letâ€™s 
read and consider the Pegaso Sustainability Report for 2019.
