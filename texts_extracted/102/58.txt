We attribute paramount importance to optimum storage of products and their 
stability and this is reflected in our choice of glass, for example: a material 
which impacts the overall weight but which is fully recyclable.

LARGER SIZE PACKAGES: AN ADVANTAGE FOR USERS AND FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT.
The sustainability process brought to the fore the issue of waste generated by 
products and highlighted the high percentage of the impact of packs against 
their net content. As a result of this, over the years we have responded by 
creating larger size packs or using lighter and more eco-friendly materials.
In 2019 we brought to market larger size packs of AxiMagnesio powder 
(180g tub), Enzitime (pack of 48 tablets), PegaStress (pack of 28 
sachets).
We  guarantee  product  quality  and  help  the  consumer  dispose  of  the 
containers, using jars and vials in glass, pouches in paper and recycled 
plastic accessories.
