The packaging used does not come from recycled materials but is, for the most 
part, recyclable as long as it guarantees the safety and proper storage of the 
product.
We have chosen to use paper from FSC certified forests for all disclosure 
and information material supporting our communications.
TARGET 12.4, 12.5
Suppliers used are therefore certified to guarantee continuity in the FSC chain.
The materials used in our offices are not from recycled sources.
CONTAINERS AND PACKAGING.
We  use  materials  like  glass,  PE  plastic  (guaranteed  BPA  free)  and 
cardboard, some of which comes from non-recycled renewable sources. Our 
packaging is made from recyclable, easily separated materials.
Blister packs are not recyclable, as they are bonded, and are used for 
tablets  or  capsules  that  are  particularly  sensitive  to  external  atmospheric 
conditions,  to  ensure  optimal  product  storage.  Aluminium  blister  packs  are 
currently not economically sustainable.
For  secondary  packaging  (shipping  of  finished  product)  we  optimise 
recyclable  materials  such  as  cardboard,  biodegradable  packing  peanuts, 
Airplus air pillows and polypropylene adhesive tape.
In the last three months the company sold Schwabe products whose packaging 
materials are not reported and whose containers will be included in the next 
2020 report.
