The current logistics organisation provides efficient services ranging from 
warehousing and storage to shipping of goods.
During shipping by third parties to our logistics department, heat-sensitive products 
which travel at controlled or refrigerated temperatures are tracked throughout and 
their temperature checked upon arrival at destination.
The technological quality control system used in the order preparation stage has 
enabled errors in packing to be reduced to virtually zero.
For packing and shipping of goods, we use Air Plus recyclable plastic air pillows and 
biodegradable corn peanuts to prevent breakages or damage to goods.
Shipping to clients is entrusted to transportation companies with refrigerated vehicles 
during the summer months.
The online tracking service allows us to request a text message to be sent to 
the recipient of the goods, providing notification of the date and time of 
delivery. Since November, delivery of new products by third parties have been 
sent directly to the warehouse in Egna, in preparation for the complete transfer 
of all goods there by the end of the year.
