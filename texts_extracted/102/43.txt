products but also through sharing and growing our culture of “Here's another 
way to wellbeing”, a way that starts with taking responsibility for our own health 
and self-awareness.
We consider this activity to be strategic because by expanding the culture 
and knowledge of health-related topics, we automatically boost the ability 
of all those in the supply chain downstream (physicians, trade, consumers) to 
make informed choices, which increases interest in the product and in turn 
expands the market. Offering a quality product also means investing in quality

These actions are both strategic and all about sustainability for us because 
they offer content and value that goes beyond the product, for the good of

Building valuable relationships with Universities and Academic Institutions is 
essential  for  our  sector,  because  it  leverages  innovation  and  boosts  the 
company’s standing. Although we do not have a written policy for management 
of  relations  with  scientific  and  academic  partners,  we  devote  time  and 
resources  to  maintaining  these  initiatives,  which  fall  under  the  remit  of  our 
Scientific Division and Marketing Division.
