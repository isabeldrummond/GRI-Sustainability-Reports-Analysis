Clients and Physicians
We use various methods of engagement in the distribution of our products with 
regard to intermediary figures, depending on the set objectives. The first type of 
engagement  is  put  into  practice  by  medical  representatives  and  agents 
through regular promotional visits throughout the area.
Area meetings (Medical Meetings attended by the Scientific Information 
Director).
Participation at events organised by third parties.
"Post market monitoring" service: process of management of complaints, 
adverse  reactions  and  reporting  of  various  types  through  an  on-line 
survey (mandatory for medical devices but not for supplements).
Final consumers: in areas temporarily without an agent, HQ staff keep 
customers up to date on new developments and the commercial offering 
currently available.
Foreign  clients:  The  Foreign  sales  manager  visits  clients  regularly  to 
maintain close business relations.
Final consumers
A direct channel has been in place for many years with the final consumers of 
our products, providing feedback through:
Personalised online consultation service.
"Customer care" service.
Publishing activities on the Facebook page.
"Post-market monitoring" service (mandatory for medical devices but 
not for supplements): process of collection, analysis and monitoring of 
complaints, adverse reactions and any other reports.
Training centres
We have an ongoing, quality relationship with some training centres that has 
led to some of our highly-qualified speakers presenting professional training 
and refresher courses.
Frontis:  we  have  collaborated  for  many  years  to  promote  wellbeing 
medicine to patients and health operators through interventions and 
meetings.
