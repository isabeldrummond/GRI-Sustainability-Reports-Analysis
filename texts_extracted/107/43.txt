3.2 RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
Among the ones mentioned above, there are four which have introduced research, experimentation and innovative 
technologies development: 
  a)   galvanic chrome-plating with high environmental sustainability, based on the use of  Trivalent Chromium;
  b)  metallization pvd for components aimed at aesthetic and functional covering of road radar equipment;
  c)  induction heated molds and high definition laser cut texture; 
  d)  or aesthetic Polypropylene radiator grilles: glass filled and Poly-methyl-meta-acrylate modified. 
Two projects are aimed at research and testing of new materials and productive technologies for lighter structural 
components; in the first case, with the use of recycled materials for standard mold components in the automotive 
industry and, in the second case, following chrome-effect painting.
The seventh project provides for research and test of the Vacuum Wrapping process for aesthetic components of cars 
exterior. Finally, the last one was dedicated to research and development of the three-coat painting cycle Aluoptik for 
future replacement of chrome finishing on vehicle external parts.
Sole Pontedera used tax credit for research and development activities in 2018, as well. In this context, three projects 
were set up; the first, aimed at a new conductive primer study and development, having unique characteristics of 
“universality” of use and redefinition of process solutions for its application. The second one investigated and developed 
innovative technological solutions and increased efficiency and environmental sustainability following overspray 
dejection. Finally, the third project focused on developing new formulation, technological and process solutions, 
regarding the treatment and reuse of internal waste in the production process.
Sole Suzzara is among those which, in 2018, got benefits from tax credit in the research and projects development, by 
carrying out three initiatives. The first one concerns the study of a new line for sheet assembly, with mixed graphic-
