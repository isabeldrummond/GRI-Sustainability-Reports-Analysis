The production process that has the greatest impact from VOC emissions’ point of view is painting. For this process, the 
total quantity of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) emitted has been reported, which are conveyed into post-combustors, 
very high-efficiency equipment able to break down these substances, present in the outgoing stream of spray booths, from 
thousands of mg / Nmc to a few units. VOCs breakdown occurs by thermal oxidation (combustion) of the latter. The heat 
produced by VOCs combustion is recovered either in the same painting plant (heating of drying ovens and so on) or for different 
company needs. 
In the following table, you can find the details of VOC’s emissions for each plant, where the painting process takes place:
