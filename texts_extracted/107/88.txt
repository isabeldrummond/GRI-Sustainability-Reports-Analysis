5.6 WATER RESOURCE PROTECTION
The environmental impact on water resources of PSC production sites is not harsh and there are no factories in water-stressed 
areas with high risk.
In Prima Components sites, this impact is divided in three categories: 
1) industrial water purification tanks (if there is a painting procedure, the water will be used in a closed circuit for the moulding
process);
2) civil wastewater;
3) rain water.
In Sole Components business unit, water is mainly used for the moulding cooling process of the sites, for hygienic and cleaning 
purposes, as well as fire reserve.
In PSMM business unit, there are the same usages as mentioned above whereas in Twice PS business unit, water is used mainly 
for the moulding cooling process. 
In Bergamo plant, the steam needed for machine operating is produced by cogeneration. 
In ISO 14001-certified sites, potential impact on water resource will be identified and the most important ones will be managed 
according to the Deming cycle (plan – do – check – act). 
Environment pillar assesses water resource impact for the factories using Word Class Manufacturing (WCM) method, such as 
Prima Components Anagni, Prima Components Ferentino and PSMM Pernambuco also according to stakeholders interaction, in 
the first place clients and suppliers.
For all the other sites, method of analysis and structured approaches for a proper use of water resource is being developed.
Many sites in the group aim to reduce impacts on the resource by operating through an integrity assessment of  water supply, 
in order to avoid losses. Furthermore, there was an introduction of differentiated discharges and the construction of a first rain 
water treatment plant, for which in 2018 the Unique Environmental Authorisation (AUA) was requested.
All volumes taken and discharged, as described in the tables below, refer to fresh water.
