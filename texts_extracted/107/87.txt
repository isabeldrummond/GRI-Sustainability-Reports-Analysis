In the plants where the Word Class Manufacturing (WCM) methodology is present, such as Prima Components Anagni, Prima Components 
Ferentino and PSMM Pernambuco, the Environment pillar applies the 5R tool for waste reduction projects.

following hierarchy of action:

Reuse a material as often as possible before making it a waste 
Recover waste in order to produce new
