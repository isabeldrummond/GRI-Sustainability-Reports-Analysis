3.4  CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND
  QUALITY OF PRODUCTS
Product safety and non-compliance with legal requirements 
are evaluated in FMEA, by adopting the most stringent 
parameters. During the reporting period, PSC had no cases 
of non-compliance with voluntary regulations and/or codes 
regarding health and safety impact on its products and 
services. 
The monitoring of customer satisfaction, along with the 
supplied product, is a constant process. Such process is 
also made quick thanks to online platforms, popular in 
the automotive field, where reports, such as complaints 
and rejects, are given in real time. Moreover, monthly 
assessments are made by taking into account the quality of 
products and the services provided. 
Each production site is functionally responsible for the 
management of possible customerâ€™s complaints. Monitoring 
and timing review of assessments received by customers, 
instead, are subject of management committees of business 
units and our Group.
