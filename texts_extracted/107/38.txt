3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT
The activities in line with PSC strategic guidelines are defined by the business holding: each production site adheres to them, 
according to the following process:
· PSC analysis of the business plan: each business unit finds solutions complying with its own standards, so to apply the 
guidelines established by the Group.
· Identification of the relevant factors thanks to the S.W.O.T. Analysis (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats): it 
is therefore possible to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the internal context, as well as the external risks and 
opportunities. These elements are subsequently related to the parties concerned.
· Evaluation and identification of significant factors: in particular, the probability of occurrences and their impact on market 
share, alongside competitive advantage and reputation. 
· Definition of operational planning, taking into account the risks involved, in particular:
  √  Avoid risk by deciding not to start or to continue the activity in the event of its arising
  √  Take or increase risk, in order to pursue an opportunity
  √  Remove the source of risk
  √  Change the probability
  √  Change the consequences
  √  Share the risk with a partner (also through contractual formulas for financial risk control)
