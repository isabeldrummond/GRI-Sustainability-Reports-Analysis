3.3 BUSINESS PARTNERS RELATIONS
The partnerships that PSC builds with its customers have always been remarkable for being solid. To support this, several 
production sites of the Group are located in the same areas as a point of reference. Some examples are: Sole Suzzara, which is 
located in the IVECO plant district, as well as Sole Pontedera, which is located in the Piaggio district. 
PSC has two joint ventures with Magneti Marelli: one (50%) in the Pernambuco plant in Brazil.
In the reporting year, no company of the Group was affected by legal actions in anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust or 
monopoly operations. However, the above-mentioned fields will be particularly highlighted in the new code of ethics and 
conduct. 
The partnership  relations with its suppliers are also characterized by solid bonds.
The strategic purchasing department of PSC defines framework agreements with large groups that produce, for example, raw 
materials and paints. In addition, it promotes the growth of suppliers working in its sites, by supporting them within its facility, in 
order to achieve the highest environmental and safety standards.
