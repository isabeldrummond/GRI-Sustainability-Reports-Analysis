policies and procedures  With reference to the respect and protection of human rights, a subject considered material by 
Legislative Decree 254/2016, the Company refers to two main sources: the Universal Declaration of 
 
Human Rights, approved by the United Nations Assembly in 1948 and the corporate Code of Ethics 
  (which will be implemented in line with D.Lgs. 231) and which will take up the issues most directly 
related to the business activity. These are protected rights in all countries where advanced labor 
legislation is applied and in which a model of modern well-being is developed, as happens in 
European countries where Eurosuole operates. Even though our company has reasonably assessed 
that it is not exposed to risks deriving from the lack of respect for human rights, we are in any case 
developing and implementing a specific policy in this regard, considering that the scrupulous 
application of the legislation in force and the activity exercised by the control management and are 
sufficient to face any risks deriving from this area; the company will have this information in the next 
reporting period.
