                LIABILITIES 
                           (Ref. Art. 2427, first paragraph, no. 4, Civil Code) 
 
The company has availed itself of the right not to use the amortised cost criterion and not to discount 
  the debts, given the insignificance of the relative effects, in order to give a true and fair view. 
The accounting policies adopted provide for: 
 
the non-discounting of payables due in less than 12 months; 
  the non-discounting of payables in the event that the effective interest rate is not significantly different 
from the market interest rate. 
 
the non-application of the amortised cost criterion for payables due in less than 12 months; 
the non-application of the amortised cost criterion in the event that transaction costs, commissions and 
 
any other difference between the initial value and the value at maturity are immaterial. 
  Therefore, payables are stated at their nominal value. 
   
 
 
Variation and due of the liabilities 
 
The maturity of payables is broken down as follows (article 2427, first paragraph, no. 6 of the Italian 
  Civil Code)
