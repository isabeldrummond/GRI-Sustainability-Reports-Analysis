For the water supply we use the well and the aqueduct. The meters at the water collection points directly 
measure the volume of water extracted from the two types of sources. 
The well derives water from the Chienti river bed; the company has been authorized to draw water from the 
Marche Region for thirty years. For some years now, we have had a closed-loop production system that 
constantly reuses the water for cooling.  
This means that the well water is used exclusively for the recharging of the closed-loop system and for the 
irrigation of the company's green areas. The total volume of water taken from the well amounts to 8,210 mÂ³ and 
from the table below you can see that consumption has decreased compared to last year. 
For aqueduct water consumption is not attributable to the production process but to the toilets and therefore 
not related to parameters related to production activity.  
In 2018, the value of water consumption from the aqueduct fell sharply (about 35%), for an awareness of staff 
against waste and some technical measures on sanitary facilities (eg timers in the showers).
