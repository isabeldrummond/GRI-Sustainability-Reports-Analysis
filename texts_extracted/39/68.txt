We are willing to offer full access to information about the characteristics of our products. Our purchasing and 
waste  department  provides  customers  with  the  origin  of  components,  composition  and  destination of 
products. 
For the identification and labelling of our products, we provide: 
 
  The date of manufacture; 
  The lot; 
  Product traceability; 
  The name of the product. 
 
In line with the values of transparency, integrity and responsible sourcing of raw materials, we are able to offer 
a clear assessment of the life cycle of the soles to our customers, if required. It must be stressed that our soles 
are an intermediate product and that therefore it is the responsibility of the shoe manufacturer, who assembles 
the sole to the other parts of the shoe and sells the finished product, to adequately inform the final consumer. 
We are committed to monitoring and evaluating every type of sole we produce and we can say that they do 
not cause significant environmental impacts in the distribution chain.
