   During the year, our company mainly completed the investments concerning the new mixing plant in the rubber 
sector; the investment is technologically advanced and can count on the interconnection such that it has been 
  brought back into the investments called industry 4.0 
To complete the increased production capacity, following the new rubber mixing plant, the Company completed the 
 
purchase and testing of the latest generation of interconnected and functional injection moulding machines for the 
same sector. 
 
During the 2018 financial year, the company began work on the construction of the new office wing, which is 
  expected to be completed during the 2019 financial year. 
In the current financial year, the company has planned to further strengthen the rubber sector by investing in 
 
additional injection moulding machines and preforming machines with high technological requirements, so as to 
minimise the waste of raw materials. 
 
To try to better serve the high-end sector, the Company has planned further investments of a transversal nature in 
  the two sectors in which it operates, rubber and polyurethane, with the intention of establishing a true independent, 
organised and highly specialised division that can contribute to guaranteeing the high quality standards required by 
  this type of clientele. 
The  investments  will  concern  a  machine  for  the  production  of  polyurethane  soles  with  high  technological 
 
characteristics, a mixer with smaller dimensions that can be more flexible and easily converted, guarantee smaller 
  quantities of orders and that can reduce the waste of raw materials to a minimum. 
 
The most important infrastructural investments 
for  the  three-year  period  2017-2018-2019 
   
concern the reconstruction of the demolished 
  Increase in fixed assets  Amount (in EUR)  shed and the putting into use of the industrial 
factory  as  well  as  new  offices  that  were

  completed during the first months of 2019.  
Plant and machinery   5.643.554 
We expect this investment to have long-term 
  Industrial and commercial equipment  806.170  positive  impacts  on  the  local  economy  and 
  Other assets  164.002  society  as  increased  soles  production  will 
increase the work of suppliers and have positive 
In costs with multi-year utility  26.485 
  impacts  on  employment.  This  is  one  of  the 
In assets under construction and  2.011.560 
  reasons why Eurosuole believes it can make a

sustainable and long-term contribution to the
