The table shows the fugitive air emissions from raw materials during 2018. It can be seen that all values are within 
 
acceptable limits.  Each year Eurosuole aims to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  The amount of VOCs caused 
by dyes has decreased although the amount used in production has increased.  In addition, although we have increased 
 
the use of paint to meet fashion trends and the needs of our customers, we have managed to reduce the amount of 
  solvents, which have a greater impact on the environment.

DallFrom the analysis of the internal reports that report the recordings of the ordinary maintenance of the systems for reducing 
  emissions into the atmosphere, no emergency situations emerge at the plants. In 2018, however, the usual preventive 
  extraordinary maintenance operations were carried out on the abatement plants in order to avoid malfunctions during the year, 
in particular:   
  -Engines and impellers: control of all the intake motors and balancing of the impellers serving all the emission chimneys.  
-Compounds department: control of the efficiency of the sleeve plant for the abatement of the dusts of the dosing and mixing 
 
plant.  
-PU moulding: cleaning of the pipes and the precipitation towers for the abatement and recovery of the silicone,   
 
-Finishing: cleaning of the pipes of the paint dust abatement system.   
The indices relating to emissions into the atmosphere relate to solvent consumption and are derived from the raw material 
 
consumption data managed with a four-monthly solvent plan and summary for the entire calendar year.  The comparison is 
  always made with the previous year.   The first index evaluates the quantity of total solvents used compared to the entire 
production volume.  This ratio is slightly higher than in 2017, with a slight upward trend in recent years and below the value of 
  internal acceptability.   The second index concerns the quantity of raw materials used for the formulation of paints and the 
finishing activity compared to the painted pairs.  In 2018 this index shows a further increase compared to previous years.  The 
 
increase in these two indices can be correlated to the fact that in recent years there has been an increase in demand for thicker 
soles, i.e. soles with a larger volume and surface area, which obviously lead to an increase in the painted surface.  These demands 
 
are strongly related to customers and the market, which are often influenced by fashion trends.  The third index is maintained to 
characterise the quality of the raw materials used.  This shows an increase in 2018 compared to 2017, which represents a greater 
 
presence of solvent in the raw material paint used.  The objective over the years has been to be able to apply a water-based paint 
  more in order to lower the VOC content of raw materials, but working the Eurosuole on customer orders, while offering this type 
of finish, can not impose itself significantly on the market, so the fluctuations will always be minimal.  In fact, in recent years the 
  trend has been towards full and fluo colours with several layers that can only be carried out using solvent-based paints.   
The fourth index counts the number of hours worked for maintenance operations.  In 2018, the number of hours increased due 
 
to the shifting of the lines, the modification of the abatement systems (introduction of bag filters in the coating).
