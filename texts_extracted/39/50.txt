                INCOME TAXES FOR THE YEAR 
 
 
Taxes have been recorded on an accruals basis and therefore represent: 
- The amounts of taxes paid or to be paid for the year, determined according to the rates and regulations in force. 
- The amounts of taxes relating to previous years. As already pointed out in the first part of this document, the 
Company, having reached agreement on the "Patent Box", has calculated the estimated benefit for the period 
2015-2017 and allocated it to this item, while the estimated result for the year 2018 has reduced the taxable 
income for the year. 
- The amount of deferred taxes or taxes paid in advance in relation to temporary differences arising or cancelled 
during the year.

The significant reduction in the tax rate is due, in addition to the recognition of the tax benefit associated 
 
with the optional regime of the "Patent Box", to the significant tax benefits of the so-called super and 
   
hyper depreciation, from which the company has benefited by virtue of the heavy investments made in 
 
recent years, most of which fall within the scope of Industry 4.0
