Depreciation  was  calculated  on  the  Vehicles and internal means of transport  20% 
basis of the useful life of the asset and 
General and chemical plants  7,50% 
its  use  in  the  production  phase. 
Rubber plants  10% 
Depreciation  charged  to  the  income 
statement was calculated on the basis  General machinery  12,50% 
of the expected use, destination and 
Office furniture, furnishings and machines  12,00% 
economic-technical  duration  of  the 
Specific machinery and equipment PU  12,50% 
assets, on the basis of the criterion of 
the residual possibility of use.  Rubber machinery  15,00% 
  Electrical and electronic office machines  20,00% 
 
 
For assets whose residual value was lower than the amount obtainable by applying the previous rates, this 
residual amount was expensed. 
Capital goods of a modest unit amount (not exceeding Euro 516.46) were fully expensed during the year, given 
their almost constant repetition over time. 
Land and the areas underlying and appurtenant to the buildings owned were not depreciated as they are 
considered assets not subject to deterioration and have an unlimited useful life. 
Depreciation thus calculated is consistent with the behaviour of our company in previous years and takes into 
account the residual possibility of use of the assets. 
Given the structural changes to the tax rules for calculating depreciation, introduced with effect from the tax 
period following that in progress at 31/12/2007, the depreciation thus calculated and charged to the income 
statement was lower than that fiscally allowed, this lower amount represents a decrease in taxable income for 
IRES with the generation of the corresponding current and prepaid taxes.
