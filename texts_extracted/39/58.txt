            Diversity in the workplace [102-38] [401-2] 
Particular attention, as far as human resources are concerned, is paid to the enhancement of diversity. We 
support equal opportunities for all employees and treat them with respect for diversity. 
The issue of integration and equal opportunities for all citizens is a very topical one, given the many migrations 
across Europe. We are aware that the overall employment situation in Italy is difficult and Italian citizens 
themselves find it difficult to find a job. However, we recognise the need to give equal opportunities and the 
possibility of a dignified life to all. 
Since the beginning of our activity, we have pursued a policy of non-discrimination. As you can see in the table 
below, our team is very international, obviously taking into account the size of our company. Thanks to the 
respectful behavior between employees and management, we have managed to create a very friendly work 
environment, in which people feel almost like a family. We believe that valuing diversity in terms of age, gender, 
culture and physical abilities has many advantages for the working atmosphere and can be a good example for 
 
other companies.

The table of recruitment by age group shows that we have mainly hired young people to whom we have provided 
initial general training on safety that they had not attended before working with us.   
    In 2018 the company benefited from the facilities provided by law 190/2014, on the subject of the hiring of young 
people, for a total of 134,010 euros. The main reason for the lack of balance between female and male employees is 
 
closely related to the type of activity we perform.  The Company provides benefits to full-time employees as well as 
temporary or part-time employees  
 
TURNOVER 
  During 2018, we recorded a turnover compensation rate of 1.25%.
