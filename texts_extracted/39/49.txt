WRITE-DOWNS OF RECEIVABLES INCLUDED IN CURRENT ASSETS AND OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
Trade receivables, with the exception of those covered by insurance policies, were subject to a risk coefficient 
 
of 0.50%, for a total of Euro 37.794, within the limits also of the amount granted for tax purposes. During the 
  year, an amount of Euro 19.727 was expensed for losses on receivables incurred, fully covered by the use of

It is considered that the amounts set aside, also taking into account the residues of previous years, are sufficient 
 
to cover the foreseeable risk of insolvency.
