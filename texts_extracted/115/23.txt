ON THE SIDE 
OF PROGRESS  
There is now international consensus that the fight 
against climate change represents the biggest challenge 
humanity must face in the 21st century.
According to the Global Risks Report 2019, recently published by 
the World Economic Forum, extreme weather events, 
failure to reduce carbon emissions and build climate resilience 
are among the top risks that pose a serious threat to global stability.
Recently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
published a special report describing the dramatic effects 
of climate change and the immediate steps to take to limit global warming 
in the future.
So far, the energy sector has taken significant steps to limit 
the emissions of greenhouse gases from their own operations. 
However, the challenge for this sector will be to meet 
the increasing demand for energy by the global population,
which is estimated to exceed 9 billion by 2040, while tackling 
climate change.
