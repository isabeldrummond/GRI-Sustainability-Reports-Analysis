OUR COMMITMENT 
TO THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT
The United Nations Global Compact is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative which involves almost 10,000 
companies from 160 countries to align strategies and operations with its ten universal principles on human rights, labour, 
environment and anti-corruption. Saipem officially became a signatory in 2016, drawing inspiration from the Ten Principles 
to run a sustainable business that creates value for its stakeholders.
“
I am pleased to renew Saipem’s commitment to support the UN Global Compact in 2019: we have been an active player 
since 2016 and we have worked to make this initiative and its principles part of our business strategy, day-to-day 
operations and organisational culture. Every year we aim to strengthen our effort in all our spheres of influence to 
protect and respect human rights and international labour standards, safeguard the environment and fight corruption. 
Furthermore, since our business partners play an important role in making our business sustainable, increasing attention 
is dedicated to promote the respect for the Ten Principles also along our supply chain, contributing to advancing 
sustainable development together. This renewed commitment is concrete proof of our willingness to be a leader striving 
“
for constant progress while meeting our stakeholders expectations.
