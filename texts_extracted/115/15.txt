OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
The UN Global Compact is also a call to contribute to achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), societal goals 
at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted in 2015 and aimed at ending extreme poverty, fighting 
inequality and injustice, and protecting the planet by 2030.
In working towards these goals, we not only have focused on the ones that relate directly to our business, but also on the 
ones connected to our ability to create value in the areas where we operate. Specific local initiatives have been carried out in 
areas such as socio-economic development, education and professional training, environment and health promotion.
