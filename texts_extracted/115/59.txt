HEALTH AWARENESS AND PROMOTION IN THE WORKPLACE
For the fifth year running, Saipem has taken part in the Workplace Health Promotion (WHP) programme as result of the 
joint efforts of employers, workers and local institutions. Its aim is to improve health and well-being in the workplace by 
adopting best practices in the field of health promotion: Saipem was awarded for reaching the programmeâ€™s goals by the 
regional government of Lombardy. The programme is founded on the principles of promoting health in the workplace by 
encouraging organisational changes that ensure an environment open to the conscious adoption and dissemination of 
healthy lifestyles, contributing to the prevention of the NCDs.
