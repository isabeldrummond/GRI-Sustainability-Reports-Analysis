B. D ata includes also n. 30 claims/complaints/allegations (of which n. 5 pending as of 31/12/2019) which have been reported through channels not fully 
dedicated to whistleblowing and that are sent to the competent function for investigation (e.g. complaint management).
C. P lease note that the categories of closed cases refer to whistleblowing cases with sufficient elements to perform investigations. In 2019 n. 49 reports 
In 2011 we adopted a system implemented at Group level which provides employees with a way to report unacceptable received which were in the scope of the Global Policy on whistleblowing did not have sufficient elements.
conduct (i.e. whistleblowing). By unacceptable conduct we mean any action and/or omission performed during 
the working activity that could in any way affect it. This could be a violation of bank activity rules or any violation 
that causes or could cause damage or bias to UniCredit and/or its employees. Any employee can make use of this 
mechanism to report a reasonable suspicion of unlawful conduct that could be potentially harmful or detrimental 
to the Group or its employees.
The Group’s approach to whistleblowing is set out in a specific Global Policy. In order to promote a corporate culture
based on ethical behaviour and good corporate governance, the Policy governs reports of unacceptable conduct by
employees within the Group.
The Policy is intended to:
•  grant a corporate environment where employees may feel free to make reports on unacceptable conduct
•  define adequate communication channels for the receipt, analysis and use of the reports.
The management of this process is designed to ensure the greatest possible protection and confidentiality of the
identity of the whistleblower and of the accused individual and to prevent any possible retaliatory or discriminatory
behaviour in response to the report.
At local level, for example in Italy, UniCredit SpA has identified the Head of Group Compliance CEE, ABC, 
Governance, Education & Business Management, as the person responsible for internal whistleblowing systems 
and for ensuring that the procedure is followed correctly. If the people referred to above are hierarchically and 
functionally subordinate to the person to whom the whistleblowing report relates or if they themselves are 
accused of violation or if they have a potential interest in the report that would compromise their impartiality and 
independence of judgment, then they may contact Internal Audit directly as the reserve function.
The channels (some of which are available 24 hours a day) provided by UniCredit SpA for employees to make 
whistleblowing reports, anonymously - if desired, are as follows:
•  by phone. The UniCredit SpeakUp line allows the employee to leave a voice message report with an option to 
remain anonymous
•  on the website, where the UniCredit SpeakUp web service allows the employee to submit a written report with an 
option to remain anonymous
•  by e-mail to the UniCredit Italy Whistleblowing e-mail address
•  by letter to the dedicated UniCredit Italy Whistleblowing postal address
•  by physical meeting.
In June 2019 a new Policy was issued which introduces the opening of the whistleblowing channels to Third Parties.
