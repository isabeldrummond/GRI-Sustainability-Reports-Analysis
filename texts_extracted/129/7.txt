The future: what lies ahead
UniCredit clearly shows that pan European banking is the future for our industry to support the growth 
of our clients, and of Europe. We are passionate Europeans, "One Bank, One UniCredit" across all our 
countries, combining central support and local excellence.
With Transform 2019, we have shown we always favour long-term sustainable outcomes over short-term 
solutions, and this is also one of the key pillars of Team 23. This is how we will deliver €16bn of value 
creation during our new plan, €8bn via capital distribution and €8bn from increased tangible equity. 
Beyond purely economic goals serving our shareholders, we will continue to “Do the right thing!” for all 
our other stakeholders, from our clients, our team members, to our communities and the environment.
Let me conclude by reiterating how immensely proud I am of all my UniCredit colleagues who work so 
hard to achieve the success of our Group, making sure we can continue to support the real economy, 
serve our clients, encourage growth across all our markets, transform our Group, and deliver recurring 
value to all our stakeholders. 
Thank you!
