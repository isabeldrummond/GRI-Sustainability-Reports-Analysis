Furthermore, for significant information, considering the Group activities and characteristics:
- at group level
a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the DNF, and in particular
to the business model, policies implemented and main risks, we carried out
inquiries and acquired supporting documentation to verify its consistency with the
available evidence;
b) with reference to quantitative information, we have performed both analytical
procedures and limited assurance procedures to ascertain on a sample basis the
correct aggregation of data.
- for the sites of Puidoux (Switzerland) of CRB S.A. company and Olgiate Comasco (Italy)
of Cosmint S.p.A., that we have selected based on their activities, relevance to the
consolidated performance indicators and location, we have carried out site visits during
which we have had discussions with management and have obtained evidence about the
appropriate application of the procedures and the calculation methods used to
determine the indicators.
Conclusions
Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that the DNF of the Intercos Group for the year ended on 31st December 2019 has not been
prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the requirements of articles 3 and 4 of the
Decree and the GRI Standards.
