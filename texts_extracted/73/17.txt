The materiality matrix 
 
 
In particular, the main results are reported hereafter: 
•  the most relevant topics, both under Corporate and stakeholders point of view, are “Occupational Health 
and safety” and “Waste management”, coherently in line with Intercos’ productive reality;  
•  “Customer health and safety”, “Reponsible sourcing” and “Respect for Human rights” are the most 
relevant topics for Intercos, mostly due to the business activity and the importance of such topics with 
regard to the raw material sourcing process;  
•  the  topics  related  to  “Energy  and  climate  change”,  “Employees’  welfare  and  wellbeing”  and 
“Sustainable consumption of natural resources” are relevant under stakeholders point of view and 
reflect their increasing importance at global level, as well as the relevance of know-how and human capital 
within the business. 
 
The materiality matrix update has not entailed major changes from 2018.
