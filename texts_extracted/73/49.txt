Management of water resources 
Water resources and their prudent management represent an important theme for the Intercos Group. In 
particular, the correct management and disposal of the waters used in the production process, and thus 
require specific chemical-physical treatments before being discharged into the sewer system, are of 
particular relevance. 
Like for the other environmental aspects, there is currently no centralized model for the management of 
water supplies and water discharges, and the operating procedures for the treatment of these aspects is 
left to the individual companies / plants. 
Regarding the management of water supplies, Intercos Europe S.p.A, withdraws its water resources from 
the municipal waterworks, for both civil and industrial uses, or through wells, for irrigation and fire fighting. 
Intercos Europe S.p.A., has adopted a specific procedure for the management of water discharges which 
is mainly based on the provisions of the European and Italian national legislation (D.Lgs.152 / 2006 and 
subsequent amendments) and the provisions of the Single Environmental Authorization issued by the 
Province. Wastewater from production plants can generally be divided into: process water, rainwater and 
sewage. The process waters, deriving from the various cleaning operations, are generally conveyed to a 
chemical-physical treatment plant and subsequently into the sewage system. The meteoric waters, 
including the waters collected in the yards and rainwater, are usually conveyed to a separator well that 
collects the first rainwater in special accumulation / decantation tanks and then send them to the sewage 
system. The black waters, deriving from the toilets located in the factories, are sent into the sewage 
system, together with the wastewater coming from the kitchen. The Technical Services function provides 
for the daily management of the purification equipment and their extraordinary and periodic maintenance 
by qualified personnel, as regulated by the specific contracts stipulated with external maintenance 
companies. 
Information regarding the management of water resources by the Intercos Group in 2019 is provided 
below, including the total volume of water supplied by source and the total volume of water discharged 
based on quality and destination. 
As of December 31st, 2019, the water consumed by the Intercos Group amounted to 439,139 m3 supplied 
almost entirely from aqueduct. It should also be noted that as of 2019, the water consumed at the Dovera 
site is partially taken (5,851 m3) from the aquifer and is used for irrigation and fire prevention systems. 
The highest water consumption was recorded in Italy (49%), followed by China (21%) and the United 
States (21%) in which a concrete reduction has been acknowledged (-30% compared to 2018), thanks to 
the optimization of production shifts in the powder department. On the other hand, the augmentation of 
hydric consumption in the rest of Europe is mainly due to the increase in production volumes during 2019 
in the Tatra Spring site (Poland).
