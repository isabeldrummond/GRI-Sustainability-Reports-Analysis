Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group 
 
4.2  Energy management 
 
During the 2018/2019 financial year, the Piquadro Group's energy consumption stood at about 
27,232 GJ. The main types of energy sources used were: 
  electricity; 
  natural gas, diesel and LPG for heating; 
  diesel and petrol for transport. 
 
The reported energy  consumption  relates  to  the  Italian  offices, the Chinese  production 
establishment and, for electricity consumption only, the 127 direct outlets of the Piquadro 
Group. Consumption fuel by company cars is related to the company Piquadro S.p.A., The 
Bridge, Uni Best and Lancel Sogedi.  
 
Since July 2017, Uni Best has installed an air conditioning system at its headquarters which 
does not use cooling gas but just water to operate.

As regards the increase in energy consumption, it is noted that the increase was mainly due 
to the introduction within the consolidation period of the Lancel Group acquired on 2 June 
2018 with its (approximately) 60 stores. 
As far as the distribution of electricity consumption is concerned, direct outlets account for 
about 64% of the Group's total consumption. 
 
 
                                                
15 The electricity consumption of 10 direct Piquadro stores has been estimated by analogy to other stores, based on their size 
and geographical location. The electricity consumption of 40 stores of the Lancel brand is estimated annually at 300kWh/m2. 
Most of these stores are placed in airports or shopping centres whose contractual conditions do not allow timely reporting of the 
data.   
16 To ensure better reporting of the Group’s energy consumption, the data of diesel consumption has been explicitly reported as 
compared to that published in the previous NFS.
