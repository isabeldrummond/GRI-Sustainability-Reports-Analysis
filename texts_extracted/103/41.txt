Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group 
 
The use of social media allows further customer engagement and guarantees a complete 
experience of the brands, thanks to the creation of ad hoc digital content. 
In addition to traditional communication channels, the Piquadro Group is expanding its digital 
communication strategy, with the aim of broadening the scope of people reached. 
Digital strategies include: 
•  branding campaigns on the websites of the main Italian and foreign online newspapers; 
related to new collections or new products; 
•  campaigns to increase site visitors with sales or discounts; 
•  location-based campaigns by mailing in support of new openings. 
 
 
Finally, to ensure high-quality service at all stages of the product shopping experience, the 
Group pays strong attention to after-sales services through dedicated offices that provide 
a response service to requests and/or any possible customer complaints.
