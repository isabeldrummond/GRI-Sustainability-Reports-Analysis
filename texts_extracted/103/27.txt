5 The "distribution of profit for the year" for the 2018/2019 financial year corresponds to the destination of Piquadro S.p.A.'s operating profit by 
dividend which the Board of Directors will propose at the Shareholders' Meeting. Note that the information for the 2017/2018 financial year has 
been restated to use the same criterion. For the previously published 2017/2018 fiscal value scheme, in which the "Distribution of Profit for the 
Year" represented the value paid in the fiscal year, please refer to the NFS as of 31 March 2018, available on the www.piquadro.it website in the 
Investor Relations/Sustainability Report section.
