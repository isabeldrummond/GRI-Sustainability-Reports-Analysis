Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group 
 
2.7  Sustainable and transparent management of the supply chain 
 
 
The choice of suppliers is made, among other criteria, to maintain the high 
quality of the products. 
The  Group  is  committed  to  carrying  out  sustainable  and  transparent 
management  of  the  supply  chain  and,  to  this  end,  this  includes  the 
adoption of a Supplier Code of Conduct and the implementation of a sharing 
process with the main business partner categories. 
 
 
The combination of traditional Italian leather working, quality, design and innovation has 
always characterised the Piquadro company. 
The Group is constantly searching for services and products distributed by Italian suppliers 
and beyond, which will allow them to maintain high standards of excellence of the final 
products. 
The selection of suppliers and the determination of purchasing conditions are based on 
objective parameters such as, for example, quality and efficiency. 
Following the acquisition of Lancel, the Parent Company is finalising the existing supply 
contracts in order to select the best suppliers of the Piquadro Group and Lancel, creating 
Group synergies. 
 
The Group's product value chain is divided into the typical segments of: 
 
   
  Product research and development 
       
 
  Purchase of raw materials, semi-finished products, finished products and services  
 
 
  Production   
 
 
  Distribution 
 
 
  Sales to the end customer 
 
 
The Group's main types of suppliers 
 
The flexibility of the business model adopted by the Group means it can maintain the 
supervision of all critical phases of the production and distribution chain. The Group, in fact, 
internally carries out the entire phases of design, planning, production, purchasing, quality, 
marketing, communication and distribution and uses outsourcing only for part of the production 
activities, while also maintaining control, in terms of quality and efficiency of the outsourced 
phases.
