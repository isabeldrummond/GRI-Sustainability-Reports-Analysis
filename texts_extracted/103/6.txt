The Piquadro Group operates in the leather goods market and designs, manufactures and 
markets its own brand (Piquadro, The Bridge and Lancel) which are characterised by a focus 
on design and technical-functional innovation, which leads to the creation of bags, suitcases 
and accessories. 
The main characteristics for the three brands are the attention to detail and quality of the 
workmanship and leather: the Piquadro product stands apart thanks to its innovative design 
and  technological  content.  The  Bridge  enhances  the  vintage  flavour  of  the  Tuscan 
workmanship and finally the Lancel collections embody the Parisian allure of a Maison 
founded in 1876. 
At the Piquadro headquarters in the Silla area of Gaggio Montano, on the Tuscan-Emilian 
Apennine, administrative and management activities, design, research and planning, material 
choice and marketing communication strategies take place.  
The production of part of the small leather goods and some Piquadro briefcases is carried out 
internally  through  the  subsidiary  Uni  Best  Leather  Goods  Zhongshan  Co.  Ltd.  at  the 
Zhongshan plant (People's Republic of China). 
In addition, part of the production of the Lancel and The Bridge brands takes place at the 
Scandicci plant in Tuscany.
