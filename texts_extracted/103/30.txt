Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group 
 
 Piquadro also announced the renewal of its agreement with Fisi, Federazione Italiana Sport 
Invernali, the Italian Winter Sports Federation, to support, as official supplier, the men's and 
women's national team of the Alpine Ski 
World  Cup.  The  new  travel  set  that  will 
accompany  the  team  for  the  2018/2019 
racing season consists of a backpack and a 
rigid,  polycarbonate  cabin  trolley.  The 
backpack is the Brief model, 100% leather, 
equipped  with  Bagmotic  technology  that 
allows interaction via mobile phone. Thanks 
to Piquadro's Connequ app, the backpack is 
connected via Bluetooth to the smartphone 
and acts as an alarm in the event of theft or 
loss. The trolley, on the other hand, is from 
the  Seeker  line,  in  resistant  and  light 
polycarbonate. 
 
 
In addition, this year, Piquadro has returned to the motor world, choosing, as its Brand 
Ambassador, Andrea Iannone, MotoGP rider 
currently  in  full  force  in  the  Suzuki  Ecstar 
Team  and,  from  next  year,  Aprilia's  top 
athlete. Andrea Iannone perfectly embodies 
Piquadro's glam sport style due to his sporty 
look even outside the paddock and thanks to 
the choice of high-tech performance products.  
Piquadro's  fundamental  concepts  - 
technology and design – go perfectly with the 
world of engines and motors and its values of 
challenge  and  constant  research  for  the 
highest  quality  standards  through  new 
technologies. 
The Brief backpack carried by Andrea Iannone is particularly innovative, dedicated to those 
who travel for work and have two very precise needs: performance and style. 
As Brand Ambassador, the “pilota” will also have the Piquadro logo on his helmet and will be 
involved in digital activities on his social media pages.
