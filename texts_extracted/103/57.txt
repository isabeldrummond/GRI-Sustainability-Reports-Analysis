Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group 
 
In order to monitor this data relating to recorded workplace accidents, Piquadro believes that 
it is only through creating a shared system that benefits can be multiplied and, therefore, the 
main way of achieving such objectives lies in everyone’s commitment to the safety policies.  
For this reason, the Group continues its commitment to disseminating and consolidating a 
safety culture to all its employees and collaborators, developing awareness of risks and 
promoting responsible behaviour on the part of the personnel. To this purpose, the Italian 
companies Piquadro S.p.a. and The Bridge S.p.a., the Chinese production subsidiary Uni Best 
and Lancel Sogedi S.A. periodically give general and specific training on health and safety.  
Over 5,700 hours of health and safety training were provided during the financial year. 
 
The Group’s Code of Ethics also reminds all employees and workers of their responsibility to 
contribute to the process of risk prevention and health and safety protection for themselves, 
colleagues and third parties, without prejudice to individual responsibility under applicable 
legal provisions. To this end, it sanctions, within the framework of company activities, a total 
general prohibition of alcohol abuse or drug use and stipulates a ban on smoking in the 
workplace, in accordance with legal regulations and nevertheless where smoking may cause 
danger to company structures and company property or to the health or safety of colleagues 
and third parties. 
 
The system implemented by the Group's Italian companies also takes into account third party 
interference risks which may occur within the stores and, in this regard  has also been followed 
up with reports of training requirements in the retail system.
