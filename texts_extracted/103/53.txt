The principles of the individual’s centrality and the protection of equal opportunities provided in the 
Group’s Code of Ethics mean, from a practical point of view, the promotion of several initiatives to 
ensure good company welfare: 
•  to cater for employees, Piquadro has an internal canteen service, while both The Bridge 
and  Lancel  offer  a  relaxation  -  kitchen  room  for  workers  in  addition  to  the  “Ticket 
Restaurant” vouchers to eat meals elsewhere; 
•  directors and most of the Group's managers are given a company car  
•  both Lancel and The Bridge, in order to facilitate the movement of employees, also offer a 
contribution for public transport subscriptions; 
•  Furthermore, The Bridge gives its employees a 100-euro voucher to be freely spent at 
certain affiliated businesses; 
•  to guarantee its employees a high degree of flexibility and a good work/life balance, a smart 
working system is being piloted in some targeted situations in Piquadro; 
•  all companies in the Group are guaranteed maternity leave in accordance with local legal 
obligations; 
•  Uni Best has set up a dormitory facility for all workers with guaranteed board and lodging; 
•  the company's welfare in the Group’s Chinese company is also supported by the activity 
of the so-called "staff union", a team of employees who act as spokesmen of the workers 
and, with top management, promote activities and initiatives for workers. 
As for the Parent Company Piquadro S.p.A., some benefits are provided only for employees hired 
on full-time contracts (e.g. company car, accommodation, insurance).
