Sustainability Report at 31 March 2019 of the Piquadro Group 
 
1.1  The history and values of the Group  
 
The common values which the Piquadro Group pursues and identifies include the 
development, promotion and support of cultural background, talent and the potential of 
its human resources in order to create a working environment which encourages and 
values the contribution of every single human resource. 
 
The Piquadro Group aims to earn the trust, respect and loyalty of its customers on the 
basis of the efficiency and excellence of the work of its employees and collaborators. 
 
  Founded in 1987 by Marco Palmieri, then a young engineering student, it initially 
operated as a small leather goods company for third parties. 
 
  In 1998, after ten years of production for the most 
prestigious  Italian  luxury  leather  goods 
companies, Piquadro launched its own brand. 
The name comes from the combination Palmieri-
Pelletteria  which,  in  homage  to  the  fact  the 
founder likes mathematical terms, becomes P2 , 
(P  squared),  which  in  Italian  is  pronounced 
Piquadro. 
Design,  functionality  and  technology  are  the 
values on which the new leather goods brand 
aims to stand out in the market. 
 
  The first Piquadro boutique opened in 2000 in Via Spiga, in the heart of Milan's fashion 
quarter. Two years later, the first franchise store opened in Via Frattina in Rome. 
 
  In 2006, the new headquarters in Silla di Gaggio 
Montano was inaugurated, a futuristic building 
nestled  in  the  green  of  the  Tuscan-Emiliano 
Apennine,  where  the  research,  development 
and logistics processes are managed. 
 
   In 2007, Piquadro was floated on the Italian 
Stock market in Milan (Expandi segment). 
 
  The growth of the brand continues with the launch, in 2011, of Sartoria, a line of luxury 
and tailor made handmade leather goods in Italy.
