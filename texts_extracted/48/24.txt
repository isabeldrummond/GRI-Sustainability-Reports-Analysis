The Human Safety Net
The Human Safety Net was launched in 2017 with a view - provided in internal guidelines - to focusing on 
a smaller number of more similar and impactful initiatives for the communities where the Group operates 
compared to the past. It aims to activate both financial and technical resources, as well as the network of 
people and the skills of Generali’s employees and agents to meet shared goals, favouring contact with local 
communities and making lasting change in the lives of recipients.
