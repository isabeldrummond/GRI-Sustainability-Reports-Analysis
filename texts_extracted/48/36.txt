In 2016, we launched the Shareholders’ Meeting Extended Inclusion program to facilitate participation in the Shareholders’ 
Meeting to those with motor and sensory disability: some dedicated services are provided to overcome any physical, 
communication and sensory barriers, like simultaneous translation into many languages, sign language and captioning in 
Italian, reception and check-in, as well as professional medical assistance.
The Board of Directors has structured its own organization - even through the establishment of special Board 
Committees - in a manner that meets the need to define strategic planning in line with the Group’s purpose, values and 
culture and, at the same time, monitors the pursuit of this strategy with a view to the sustainable value creation over 
the medium to long term. Our integrated governance also leverages the varied and in-depth professional skills present 
in the Board and ensures effective oversight of management’s activities.
