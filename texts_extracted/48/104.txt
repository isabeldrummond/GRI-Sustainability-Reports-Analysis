To define MCR coverage, stricter Own Fund eligibility rules are applied compared to the ones previously used for the 
SCR11. In the following table, the split by tiers of the Own Funds covering the MCR is reported:

11 The amounts of Tier 2 and Tier 3 items eligible to cover the MCR are subject to stricter quantitative limits. The eligible amount of Tier 1 items shall be at least 80% of the MCR; 
the same limitation on subordinated liabilities and preference shares is set. The eligible amounts of Tier 2 items shall not exceed 20% of the MCR. No Tier 3 items are allowed 
to cover the Minimum Capital Requirement. No capital from sectoral is considered
