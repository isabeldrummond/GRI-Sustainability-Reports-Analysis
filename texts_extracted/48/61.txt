60 Generali Group Annual Integrated Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 2018
During the year, the Group retained its positioning on the market in the product inno-
vation area and in customer services thanks to the Smart Insurance programme, with 
the Generali Vitality programme extended to all of the distribution networks, the offer 
of products in telematics (Generali Mobility), domotics (Generali Domocity), and legal 
protection, and also thanks to digitalisation in health services and claims.
Generali also successfully launched many initiatives in different cities as part of The 
NFS
Human Safety Net programme, which was also presented to the Office of the President 
of the German Republic during Berlin’s Bürgerfest held in September. The programme 
supports refugees and their start-ups by providing co-working space, training courses 
and access to a wide range of trade contacts.
As regards the financial markets, the yield of the ten-year German Bund closed the year 
at 0.2% (0.4 in 2017). The DAX stock market lost 18% due to the economic data coming 
in below expectations in the Eurozone, concerns surrounding the tax policy of the Italian 
government and the Brexit negotiations.
In line with the Group's strategic initiatives, Life premiums show a growth in protection 
Life premiums 
products (+5.8%, supported by the increase in single premium policies), as well as unit-
€ 9,821
linked policies (+5.6%, thanks mainly to regular premium policies), only partly offset by   mln (+4.5%) 
the decline in savings products with regular premiums (-5.8%).
The new production in terms of PVNBP shows a reduction of 5.6% attributable to the  PVNBP
decline in the Life segment (-6.9%), affected mainly by the process to restructure the  € 8,048
 mln (-5.6%) 
sales networks; the protection sector, however, grew by 14.9%. Specifically, there was 
a contraction in savings products (-10.6%), protection products (-6.3%) and unit-linked

products (-3.0%).

New business profitability (expressed as a percentage of the PVNBP) is equal to 2.83%,   mln (-6.2%)
stable compared to 2.85% in 2017, due to the recalibration of the guarantees offered 
and the maintenance of a good business mix in spite of the decline in business. New  Life OR

The P&C segment volumes are driven by the positive performance of the non-motor

 mln (+26.5%)
(+0.2 pps), attributable to the increase in the loss ratio following higher impacts from
