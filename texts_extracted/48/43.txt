1  Changes in Life net cash inflows and premiums are on equivalent terms, i.e. at equivalent exchange rates and consolidation scope pursuant to IFRS 5. Changes in Operating 
result, Asset Under Management and Operating RoE consider, in accordance with IFRS 5, 2017 comparative data restated following the divestment of Belgian, German and 
Guernsey businesses. Investments in these assets were not excluded from consolidation in the financial statements disclosure at 31 December 2018, but were classified 
as assets held for sale, whose total assets and liabilities, as well as the result net of tax effects, were posted separately in the specific items of the financial statements. The 
comparative data was also restated following the disposal of the Dutch and Irish operations completed in February and June 2018, respectively. Please refer to the paragraph 
Changes in the presentation of the performance indicators of the Group in the Note to the Management Report for further information.
