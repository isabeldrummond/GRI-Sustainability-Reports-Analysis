Switzerland
The Generali Group has been operating in Switzerland since 1987, where it has been 
able to consolidate its position through the acquisition and merger of several insurance 
companies. In following the Group strategy, Generali Switzerland focuses on the retail 
business and provides high quality and innovative services through various distribution 
channels: agents, brokers, financial promoters and direct channels.
In 2017, Generali Switzerland ranked as the number two insurance group on the market 
in terms of premium income in the Individual Life segment with a 15.3% market share, 
and was eighth in the P&C segment with a 5% market share. The company does not 
operate in the Collective Life segment.
In 2017, the Life segment insurance market slightly dropped (-1%), also because of 
the low interest rate level, while the P&C market continued to grow (1.3%), although 
weakly.
More generally, the Swiss economy in 2018 showed a positive trend. GDP went up by 
2.9%, driven not only by domestic activities, but also by the positive development of the 
international economic activities. The sectors struck to the greatest extent by the 2015 
appreciation of the Swiss franc - the metal, machinery and tourism industries - reversed 
the trend and made a positive contribution to the economic development posted in 
2018. Nevertheless, the growth rate is expected to slow down slightly in 2019, with GDP 
recovering somewhat in 2020.
Growth of the GDP was particularly solid in 2018, also due to depreciation of the Swiss 
franc that continued up to mid-2018. The yields of the government bonds remained 
negative throughout the year.
Generali's Life premiums in the country were down 2.3% following the slowdown in 
savings product.
New production in terms of PVNBP was down (-1.7%) due to the reduction in the present 
value of future regular premiums (-4.0%), while single premiums show good growth  
(+ 56.4%) despite representing only 6.1% of total production. At business level, there was 
a drop in both unit-linked products (-2.1%) and risk products (-9.5%). The profitability 
of new business (expressed as a percentage of the PVNBP) showed a good increase 
from 3.63% in 2017 to 4.35% in 2018 mainly due to the increase in the profitability of the 
unit-linked business. The value of new business was € 17 million, up 18.0%.
P&C premiums fell by 4% due to the contractions observed both in the motor, due to 
the decline in the in-force portfolio, not offset by the growth of new production, and in 
non-auto, attributable to the AHD line which is affected by the loss of a large contract 
and portfolio cleaning activities in place since 2017.
The combined ratio rose slightly to 93.0% (+0.6 pps), mainly reflecting the increase in 
acquisition costs due to higher commissions.
