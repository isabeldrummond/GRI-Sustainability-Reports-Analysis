The Generali People Strategy, based on four priorities, ensures the execution of the business strategy while 
respecting our values.

Each priority is supported by specific Group initiatives, the results of which are measured and monitored over time 
to ensure continuous improvement.

– keep investing in performance management tools and meritocracy;
– accelerate on efficiency and velocity;
– further enhance a diverse and inclusive culture.
Since January 2018, more than 390 local actions were planned, initiated and 
communicated. At the end of December 2018, 92% of these were already 
implemented, with a view to launching 100% of the actions by the end of June 2019, 
coinciding with the third edition of the Generali Global Engagement Survey.
To create and spread a culture focusing on the empowerment of our people, in 
2017 we designed and rolled out the Managerial Acceleration Program (MAP). MAP 
fosters and strengthens a managerial culture capable of engaging and boosting the 
accountability of our people in line with the eight key managerial behaviours of the 
Generali Empowerment Manifesto (GEM). 
MAP is dedicated to the management population and fully facilitated by Group 
managers who have participated in special training and coaching initiatives (189 
trainers trained in 2018).
In 2018, 4,218 managers participated in the MAP. The goal is to train 8,900 of them by 
the end of 2019.
Increasing the accountability of our people also means boosting a performance 
culture. Through Group Performance Management we focus our efforts on spreading 
this culture while also strengthening transparency and meritocracy in line with what 
our people asked in the Generali Global Engagement Survey.
In 2018, 99%13 of our people participated in a programme involving: defining 
objectives, assessing performance, feedback and individual development plans.
13 The data exclusively refer to Group companies, equal to 54,743 employees (77.4% of the total), within the scope of the Group Performance Management process.
