1  All changes in this Report are calculated on 2017, unless otherwise reported. Changes in Life net cash inflows and premiums are on equivalent terms, i.e. at constant exchange 
rates and consolidation scope pursuant to IFRS 5. Changes in Operating result, Assets Under Management and Operating RoE consider, in accordance with IFRS 5, 2017 
comparative data restated following the divestment of Belgian, German and Guernsey businesses as well as the disposal of the Dutch and Irish operations completed in February 
and June 2018, respectively. Please refer to the paragraph Changes in the presentation of the performance indicators of the Group in the Note to the Management Report for 
further information.
2  Premiums from social and environmental products refer to companies that represent 94.4% of total gross direct written premiums contributing to the analysis. Their amount is 
hardly comparable with that of 2017 due to some methodological improvements made during 2018.
3  RIG is the Responsible Investment Guideline that codifies responsible investment activities at Group level. SRI are assets managed according to Generali Insurance Asset 
Management’s SRI (Socially Responsible Investment) proprietary methodology both on behalf of Group insurance companies and third-party clients (two funds and three 
mandates). Their change considers 2017 comparative data restated following a change in methodology.
