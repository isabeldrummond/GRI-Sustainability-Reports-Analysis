New business profitability (expressed as a percentage of PVNBP) decreased to 7.03%, 
driven by the decline in unit-linked products in Austria and Poland. However, profitability 
remains at an excellent level as it is sustained by protection products, which account for 
around 47.4% of business (in particular in Austria and the Czech Republic).
New business value amounted to € 143 million (-3.2%). 
P&C segment premiums grew by 4.8%, supported by good performance of the main 
lines of business. The motor segment grew (+5.7%), as a result of contributions mainly  P&C premiums

ble to the drop in the loss ratio (-1.3 pps), which benefits from lower impacts related to 
natural catastrophe claims. The expense ratio remained stable compared to the previ-
ous year (+0.3 pps), reflecting ongoing cost reduction measures.

GDP continues its growth trend at rates topping 3%. The ten-year Bonos-Bund spread 
ended 2018 slightly above the level recorded at the beginning of the year, while the 
Spanish stock market closed the year with a 14% loss, in line with the other Eurozone 
stock markets.
With reference to the year's performance, Life premiums fell by 8.0%, reflecting the 
decline in savings products in line with the Group's strategy of re-orienting the business

protection policies and unit-linked products increased.
