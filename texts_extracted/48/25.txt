We have a collection of Group public policies and guidelines which support our operations in a sustainable and 
responsible manner, such as: 
Code of Conduct that defines the basic behavioural principles which all the personnel of the Group are required 
to comply with: these principles are outlined in specific guidelines that refer, for example, to the promotion 
of diversity and inclusion as well as the management of conflicts of interest, personal data protection and 
corruption prevention
Group Policy for the Environment and Climate that contains the guiding principles for the strategies and 
objectives of environmental management
Responsible Investment Guideline that codifies the responsible investment activities at Group level 
Responsible Underwriting Group Guideline that outlines principles and rules aimed at assessing environmental, 
social and governance features of the prospective and insured clients in the P&C underwriting process
Ethical Code for suppliers that highlights the general principles for the correct and profitable management of 
relations with contractual partners

Together, these Group policies and guidelines contribute to ensuring respect for human rights, a topic which we began 
to focus on in 2017. The goal is to identify, prevent and mitigate the main direct risks of human rights violations to 
which the Group is exposed, while also identifying areas and activities for improvement. In line with the principles and 
instruments in place at international level, a due diligence process was initiated to evaluate human rights on the basis 
of direct business risk and country risk, and also allowed for an initial assessment in countries with potentially greater 
exposure. The Group is defining a long-term action plan based on these results.
