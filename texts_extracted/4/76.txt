AdB’s performance assessment policy is based on various systems:  
objective  subjective 
assessment  A performance plan which  assessment 
involves the personnel whose 
role, organisational position  A system aimed at assessing 
and contractual level allow  core competencies company-
them to access variable  wide and then, at an increasing 
incentive plans through the  level of detail, for each 
achievement of specific  department and individual role 
corporate and individual targets 
(MBO/RS) 
 
Through a user-friendly process, the assessment system focuses on observable and easily assessable 
conduct relevant to business goals. The starting point of the evaluation system is the identification of the key 
skills and conduct for the company. Based on AdB’s Charter of Values, a leadership model was designed in 
accordance with the company’s strategic objectives and the company’s core competencies were identified 
accordingly. Subsequently conduct relevant to each specific functional department and to each role were 
defined. The assessment is in qualitative terms, based on a daily, infographic scale with four-monthly 
feedback to develop greater and more continuous awareness of the role and skill requirements.  
In 2019, the system’s department and position Competency Dictionary was updated after organisational 
changes were implemented, and on the basis of initial user feedback. IT system performance was also 
improved, and some interfaces were made available. Among these are a quick guide and some search 
functions. Finally, the Multi-appraiser module is currently in development. This will allow assessments of this 
type to be rolled out to operative groups (currently in testing for Passenger care and Terminal Supervisors).
