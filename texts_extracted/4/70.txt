 
2.6.5 Waste management  
Among airport activities, waste mainly comes from commercial activities (i.e. shops, restaurants) and some 
operational activities, such as airport vehicle maintenance and cleaning. Though the activities do not involve 
production processes through which to reduce waste, the company is committed to maximising waste 
separation and recycling, in collaboration with the municipal administration and the urban waste collection 
services manager.  
For 2019-2020, as per Region of Emilia-Romagna requirements, a plan to minimise the use of single-use 
plastics was implemented, initially to reduce the production of single-use bottles. Among the initiatives 
implemented in 2019, all airport workers were provided with a steel water bottle, which can be refilled at 
water distribution points. AdB also carried out a project to provide water fountains in boarding areas, as well 
as plastic bottle compactors and tubs for water collection.  
The focus on waste management issues is mainly concentrated on responsible waste sorting and disposal. 
This is mainly non-hazardous special waste that cannot be directly reused within the context of such 
activities. Urban waste generated is closely linked to airport users. Waste management policies therefore 
focus essentially on the separation of such waste.  
In order to reduce waste, AdB has implemented regeneration policies, which include initiatives for the reuse 
of some types of waste, such as the donation to schools of unused computers.
