The Memorandum of Understanding for the promotion of accessible tourism at the airport was signed on 
November 16, 2018 by Bologna Airport and the Municipality of Bologna. The memorandum outlines best 
practices for inclusion and open planning at the Airport and lays the foundation for systematic, continuous 
collaboration in  improving services offered to disabled passengers, as  well as the analysis of quality 
performance, and the evaluation of training courses and infrastructural adjustments. The memorandum aims 
to concretely promote airport accessibility for disabled people and improve their travel experience, with 
particular attention paid to accessibility and parking. AdB is the third airport in Italy to sign this type of 
agreement, and is the first private company in the area. The Group is aware of the public services it 
provides, and is consequently committed to working with the Municipality of Bologna on such issues.  
ENAC “Autism - A journey through the airport” project  
Bologna Airport has joined the ENAC project “Autism - A journey through the airport”, which is designed to guarantee 
the right to mobility for everyone. Informational materials in preparation for travel were produced for the project in 
collaboration with Angsa and Asl Bologna (a dedicated brochure, informative web slideshow and video are published 
in a specific section of the airport’s website). In addition, a specific entry route has been created to assist 
passengers with autism, which is “more sheltered” than traditional routes. The project also provides the option for 
passengers with autism and their companions to take a guided tour of the airport in preparation for their flight, in order 
to familiarise them with the departure procedures. The official presentation was given at a press conference held in 
collaboration with ENAC on May 8, 2019.
