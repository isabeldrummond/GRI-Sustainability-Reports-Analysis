 
Net zero 2050: climate change in view of the commitment taken at ACI headquarters  
AdB complied with the sustainability line proposed by ACI Europe - the European airport sector 
association and representing Europe at the International Airports Council, of which AdB is a member - in 
committing to “net zero carbon emissions from airport operations” by 2050. More precisely, ACI Europe 
has drafted a resolution which on the one hand requires the EU and the governments of the member states to speed 
up the transition to clean energy use - guaranteeing therefore airports the possibility of achieving the objective at 
competitive conditions - while on the other hand opening up a dialogue with air sector stakeholders, confirming the 
objectives of the “Aviation Industry Commitment to Action on Climate Change” programme of 2008 and enabling its 
realisation, through common commitment, vision and planning, in order to deliver an overall net zero carbon 
emissions air transport system. 
“Bologna Airport is proud to subscribe to this resolution and unequivocally declares its commitment to the 
cause. Over the years, we have invested significantly in environmental management. We have been 
working on reducing CO2 emissions since 2010, and have received a 'Reduction' certification from the 
Airport Carbon Accreditation programme. We recognise that it’s time to accelerate our efforts. We have 
taken very good note of the recent IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report and the 
change in public perception of air transport. People require governments, companies and means of 
transport to be more resourceful, and we are eager to respond to this need. ‘NetZero2050' is by no 
means a trivial commitment on our part, and we are confident we will be able to identify the best 
possible solutions to decarbonise our airport operations through research, investment, sharing 
expertise, and collaboration.”
