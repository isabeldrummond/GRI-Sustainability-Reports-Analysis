ASQ (Airport Service Quality) 
To analyse passenger satisfaction, the Company uses the ASQ by ACI (Airport Council International) to 
monitor the trend of satisfaction with respect to certain chief parameters and a broad panel of national and 
international airports. Thanks to this program it is possible to compare our approach and results with the best 
practices of other international airports gather ideas and suggestions for improvement. The ASQ is the most 
prevalent worldwide benchmark programme and it involves over 200 airports in 50 countries to measure 
passenger satisfaction (every year there are more than 550,000 passengers involved worldwide).  
In 2019, Bologna Airport further improved its performance levels in terms of nearly all aspects. The overall 
satisfaction index for 2019, calculated on a scale 1-512, was 3.82 and the airport’s strengths were its staff, 
information and wayfinding.  
“Airport Angels” 
From the perspective of improving the quality of service provided, over the last few years AdB has been carrying out a 
project called Alternanza Scuola-Lavoro (Alternating School and Work). In 2018, it employed 120 students, while in 
2019, it employed 217 students from 13 high schools in the local area.  
The students were employed as “Airport Angels,” or passenger facilitators, and carried out various support activities in 
preparation for departure (measuring carry-ons, drop-off of baggage to be stowed in the hold, entry turnstiles at the 
security points) and arrivals (the use of automatic machines for passport control). In general, they improved the 
passengers’ experience in the Terminal by providing information and assistance. Before starting work, the “Airport 
Angels” underwent a one-week training course in the classroom (amounting to 3,260 total training hours), to learn 
about the operative procedures, security, quality of service and assistance to passengers with reduced mobility, which
