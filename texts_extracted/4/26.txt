 
Anti-corruption communication and training  
Training activity focuses on personnel in areas at risk and its contents and form vary depending on the 
addressees and the risk level of the areas in which they operate. The 231 Model and its annexes, including 
the Anti-Corruption Policy, are published on the company’s Intranet and, in simplified form, its website. In the 
event of updates, all employees are notified by e-mail via the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) 
system, which keeps a record of messages sent and read, whereas notice of the most significant changes is 
given in the form of Personnel Communications and Service Communications. All partners with contractual 
relationships with AdB are informed of the Company’s adoption of the Model and all supply, service and 
consultancy agreements include a clause acknowledging and pledging compliance with the provisions of 
Legislative Decree 231/2001 and the principles of the Model and the Ethics Code.  
Anti-corruption training activities are managed by the Training Centre and include the following mandatory 
information for all employees: 
•  an e-learning module on basic training regarding the 231 Model for all Company personnel, with 
refresher courses every five years; 
•  a classroom training course by the Anti-Corruption and Ethics Committee regarding basic anti-
corruption concepts, the Ethics Code and the Whistleblowing Policy. 
The control bodies receive specific training and information following updates to regulations and the Model. 
In fact, in December 2019 the members of the Board of Directors received information in conjunction with the 
approval of the new Organisation and Management Model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01, a session 
in which all members of the Board of Directors participated. In addition, AdB’s anti-corruption policies and 
procedures were circulated to all its commercial partners through publication on its corporate website and 
the inclusion of clauses in standard contracts.
