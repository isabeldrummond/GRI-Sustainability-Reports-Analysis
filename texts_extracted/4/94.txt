In particular, we have conducted interviews and discussions with the management of
Aeroporto Guglielmo Marconi di Bologna S.p.A. and other personnel of Aeroporto Guglielmo
Marconi di Bologna S.p.A. and we have performed limited documentary evidence procedures,
in order to collect information about the processes and procedures that support the collection,
aggregation, processing and transmission of non-financial data and information to the
management responsible for the preparation of the DNF.
Furthermore, for significant information, considering the Group activities and characteristics:
- at Group level
a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the DNF, and in particular
to the business model, policies implemented and main risks, we carried out
inquiries and acquired supporting documentation to verify its consistency with the
available evidence;
b) with reference to quantitative information, we have performed both analytical
procedures and limited assurance procedures to ascertain on a sample basis the
correct aggregation of data.
- for the site of Bologna of Aeroporto Guglielmo Marconi di Bologna S.p.A., that we have
selected based on its activities, relevance to the consolidated performance indicators
and location, we have carried out a site visit during which we have had discussions with
management and have obtained evidence about the appropriate application of the
procedures and the calculation methods used to determine the indicators.
Conclusions
Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that the DNF of the Aeroporto Guglielmo Marconi di Bologna Group for the year ended on 31st
December 2019 has not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the requirements
of articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI Standards.
Other Information
The comparative information presented in the DNF for the year ended 31st December 2017 has not
been examined.
