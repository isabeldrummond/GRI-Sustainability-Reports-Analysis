The figures presented refer to the noise levels recorded by the noise monitoring equipment located in the residential 
areas adjacent to the airport. The values are below the noise limits established by law for the buffer areas and are 
constantly monitored. Data from the Airport Noise Monitoring System, consisting of seven permanent environmental 
monitoring units distributed around the airport grounds. At each of the measuring stations, the LVA index was essentially 
constant, i.e. without significant fluctuations. The indicator is driven by various factors, essentially: the number and type 
of aircraft in transit; the rate of climb and thus the overflight altitude; the trajectory followed; weight at take-off and 
landing; and the time (day or night). The noise level recorded at P6 and P7 were higher than the equivalent values for 
2018. This is due to an increase in the amount of nocturnal traffic at Bologna (runway take-offs 12, runway landings 30) 
during the peak period in 2019, compared to the peak period in 2018. 
2.6.2 Energy efficiency and contributions to mitigating climate change   
In 2013, Bologna Airport introduced an Energy Management System in conformity with the international 
standard UNI ISO50001, guaranteeing a considered use of energy resources and reduced consumption and 
costs through the drafting of an energy policy, systematic monitoring of consumption and performance 
indicators, and optimisation of production processes, corporate conduct and resource management. In order 
to effectively implement the Energy Management System, AdB established the Energy Management Team 
(EMT), a working group coordinated by an Energy Manager. The group establishes objectives at a strategic 
level for energy improvements, preparing energy and cost reporting tools, and

In line with the policies for quality, the environment, energy and safety, Bologna Airport has taken numerous 
steps to reduce consumption and emissions by making its infrastructures more energy efficient and by 
increasing the use of renewable energy sources. For example, regarding energy efficiency, the company has 
replaced low-efficiency bulbs with LED bulbs, thus optimising the lighting systems of buildings, car parks and 
airport roadways. Since 2005, AdB has participated in the voluntary GreenLight Programme promoted by the 
European Commission to encourage partner organisations to upgrade the efficiency of their lighting systems, 
with an aim to reduce energy consumption and climate-altering emissions. AdB has also improved the 
management of its heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, in particular through the use of high 
efficiency heat pumps. Regarding the use of renewable energy, Bologna Airport self-produces a significant 
portion of its electricity needs through its own photovoltaic systems and high-performance trigeneration plant. 
The energy efficiency initiatives permitted a savings of 6,900,0000 kWh compared to consumption before

measurement methodology”, based on the AEL data relating to the three weeks with highest traffic identified in 2019 
(according to a methodology applied since 2014).
