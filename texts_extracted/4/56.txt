The objectives set out for 2019 are fully in line with expectations. The only values that deviate slightly from those shared 
at the beginning of the year are: 
•  No. Voluntary safety report: this figure is slightly lower than predicted, partly as a result of the increased number 
of movements recorded in 2019 (this number was much greater than had been predicted at the beginning of the 
year, and formed the basis for the objective).  
•  Overruns: unchanged from 2018, with a total of six incidents. Despite the fact that these are events without real 
consequences, they are constantly monitored nonetheless. 
•  Spillages from ramp vehicles: the higher number of spillages is chiefly due to the increased use of ramp 
vehicles as a result of a substantial growth in the number of movements. It should also be noted that much 
handler GSE (Ground Support Equipment) is somewhat dated, and therefore more prone to faults. 
                                                
15 During the year, it was decided not to include two categories of events not considered strictly safety-related among 
such reports.
