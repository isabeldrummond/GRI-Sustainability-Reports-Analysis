 
 
The change in composition of the types of electricity consumed is due to the activation of the renewable energy supply 
contract in 2019.  
The assessment of indicator 302-1 refers to energy consumed as defined by Law No.10/91 and Ministry of Economic 
Development (MISE) Circular of 12/2014, i.e. the energy consumed for the production of goods (semi-finished products, 
manufactured products, etc.) or for the provision of services (transport of people or goods, lighting, air conditioning, 
electricity supply, etc.).  
The relevant scope includes the entire Aeroporto di Bologna Group. Consumption relating to the firefighters’ station and 
concessionaires, which is billed directly to AdB S.p.A under the agreements between the parties, but is directly available 
to third parties, has been excluded. Energy accounting for AdB S.p.A and TAG Bologna S.r.l. is carried out separately, 
while the energy consumed by FFM is expressed in its entirety within the energy consumed by AdB S.p.A. Information 
regarding diesel consumption for TAG generators is not available, while fuel consumption attributed to TAG is a mix 
between petrol and diesel.

The energy intensity is calculated as the ratio of gigajoules consumed over the number of passengers in transit.

Electricity – Location-based  t CO2  2,611.8  1,773.5  1,654.0 
Direct  and  indirect  emissions  are  calculated  using  Airport  Carbon  Accreditation’s  (ACA)  market-based  method. 
Regarding emission factors, reference is made to the ‘Airport Carbon Footprint’ Annual Report. The change in emissions 
in 2019 is attributable to the purchase by AdB of certified electricity generated from renewable sources. This difference is 
even more apparent in the change of approach to calculating emissions from the “market-based” method to the “location-
based  method”.  The  location-based  method  involves  the  use  of  average  emissions  factors  characteristic  of  the 
geographical location, whereas the market-based method contemplates emissions factors specific to the energy actually 
supplied by the provider of the service, which may in fact differ from the overall distribution grid. Finally, the change in 
diesel fuel consumption relates to the decommissioning of the diesel power stations in the office building, cargo building 
and COS building.

The reduction in emissions intensity is linked to the reduction in Scope 2 (market-based) emissions, and 
attributable to AdB’s acquisition of energy certified from renewable sources.
