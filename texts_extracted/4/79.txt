AdB considers the welfare of its employees fundamental to ensuring the productivity of the company on the 
one hand, and for making the best use of its resources on the other. For this reason, it constantly monitors 
employee  engagement,  satisfaction  and  compliance  with  the  company’s  strategy  and  values  through 
targeted surveys. Of particular note is the valuable Corporate Spirit Air People Survey programme promoted
