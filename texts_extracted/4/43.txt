 
A consolidated profit of Euro 20.9 million was reported in 2019, up 16.3% on 2018. This result mainly stems 
from the increase in passenger traffic and the knock-on benefit for all the main business components.  
The EBITDA was Euro 44.9 million (up 16.1% on 2018), while the operating result was Euro 31.1 million, 
compared to Euro 25.2 million in 2018 (up 23.2%). The Group strives constantly to create and distribute 
value to its stakeholders and calculates this value based on its reclassified consolidated income statement. 
In 2019, the economic value generated by the Group amounted to Euro 134.8 million, of which Euro 100 
million was then redistributed to the Group’s various stakeholders: suppliers (current purchases of goods and 
services and investments) (38.8%), employees (22.3%), government (12%), community (1%) and lenders 
(0.3%). 
   
*For 2019, in light of the national and international emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board of Directors of the Parent 
Company, adopting a prudent approach in order to protect financial solidity and mitigate future impacts on operating performance, 
proposed to the Shareholders’ Meeting that no dividend should be paid. This represents a break from practice in recent years, when the 
pay-out ratio was 95%.
