 
particularly in some industrial sectors. This is done by encouraging collaboration with the areaâ€™s public institutions, and 
by sharing strategic guidance oriented towards sustainable development and equal opportunities. 
 
TOGETHER FOR WORK 
As part of its social, territorial, and equal opportunity responsibilities, AdB participates in the Together 
for Work project. 
WHAT IS TOGETHER FOR WORK: a project to help those with low job-seeking autonomy enter the 
world of work, by increasing their motivation, supporting their basic and specific education, and guaranteeing them 
specific tutoring within companies. The project was born of a collaboration between the Municipality, the Metropolitan 
City and the Archdiocese of Bologna, and includes associations, trade unions and non-profit organisations.
