Feedback and Complaint management 
AdB’s policy is to stimulate and incentivise the reporting of passengers, as it does in cases of requests for 
information and assistance or potential new needs that may arise through a variety of channels that lead to 
an innovative instrument of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). The CRM project was extended to 
the management of reports and complaints, by designing an efficacious system of collecting reports and 
complaints airport users in accordance with the Quality Management System and the requirements of ISO. 
These reports are managed through the CRM, and the Company undertakes to guarantee a response as 
promptly as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of receiving the report/complaint. 
There are several channels for filing a report: on the website in the section Suggestions and Complaints and 
the App; by e-mail info@bologna-airport.it,  the hard-copy “Reports and Complaints” forms available at the 
two totems located at the information point and in the MBL room, the postcard attached to the Services 
Charter and the QR Code printed on it, and the forms available at the multimedia InfoPoints.  
Reporting and requests received through these various channels go to the CRM, where they are managed 
jointly among the various airport departments in order to reinforce and maximise assistance and information 
to passengers. In 2019, the project launched to integrate the various customer support divisions continued, 
with the aim of increasing efficiency, sharing information and applying internal service standards. Attention 
was also paid to standardising how customer responses are formulated via a course entitled “effective 
communication via e-mail," which was attended by all members of staff working in customer service.
