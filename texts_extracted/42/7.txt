Across our value chain, FCA impacts our stakeholders directly or 
indirectly. The need to transition to a more sustainable future is one 
of the major challenges facing the world today, as expressed in the 
United Nations Transforming our World 2030 Agenda. We operate 
responsibly to contribute to the relevant United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals supporting this Agenda.
The following graphics present a simplified view of the highly 
complex industry in which FCA competes to illustrate how key 
tangible and intangible inputs are converted through the Groupâ€™s 
business  activities,  bringing  value  to  the  Company,  to  our 
customers, to society and to the environment.
