CORPORATE  
GOVERNANCE 
The foundation of FCAâ€™s governance model is the Code of  KEY FIGURES
Conduct and a collection of supporting statements, including 
guidelines, that reflect our commitment to a culture dedicated 
1 
to integrity, responsibility and ethical behavior.
The  Company  governance  model  regulates  the  decision- Code of Conduct
making processes and the approach used by the Company 
and our employees in interacting with all stakeholders.
This model is supported by the whistleblowing process for 
12
reporting situations, events, or actions which may be inconsistent   Principles  
with the FCA Code of Conduct; an advanced risk management  for ethical behavior
system; and an ongoing alignment with international best 
practice and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
