These procedures consisted in verifying its compliance with the principles for defining report content and  
quality set out in the “GRI Standards”, and are summarised as follows:
•   comparing the economic and financial information and data included in the Sustainability Report with  
those included in the Group Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2018, on which  
another auditor issued the independent auditor’s report, dated February 22, 2019; 
•   analysing, through interviews, the governance system and the management process of the matters  
related to sustainability management and its relationship with the strategy and operations of the Group;
•   analysing the process relating to the definition of material aspects disclosed in the Sustainability Report,  
with reference to the methods used for the identification and prioritization of material aspects for  
stakeholders and to the internal validation of the process results; 
•   analysing how the processes underlying the generation, collection and management of quantitative data  
of the Sustainability Report operate. In particular, we have performed: 
−  interviews and discussions with the personnel and the management of FCA Group among the four  
operating regions and components segment to gather information about the accounting and  
reporting systems used in preparing the Sustainability Report, as well as on the processes and  
procedures supporting the gathering, aggregation, processing and transmittal of data and  
information to the department responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report;
−  analysis, on a sample basis, of the documentation supporting the preparation of the Sustainability  
Report, in order to gather the evidence of processes in place, their adequacy, and that they correctly 
manage data and information in connection with the objectives described in the Sustainability  
Report;
•   analysing the compliance and the internal consistency of the qualitative information disclosed in the  
Sustainability Report in relation to the guidelines identified in the paragraph “Sustainability  
organization’s responsibility on the preparation of the Sustainability Report” of this report;
•   analysing the stakeholders engagement process, in terms of methods applied, through the analysis of  
the minutes of the meetings or any other available documentation about the main topics arisen in the  
discussion with them; 
•   obtaining the representation letter signed by the legal representative of FCA Sepin S.c.p.A., on the  
compliance of the Sustainability Report with the guidelines identified in the paragraph “Sustainability 
organization’s responsibility on the preparation of the Sustainability Report” of this report, as well as the 
reliability and completeness of the data and information disclosed. 
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less than those performed in a  
reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, therefore, do not enable us  
to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters and events that might be  
identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Conclusion
Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the  
Sustainability Report of the FCA Group as of December 31, 2018 is not prepared, in all material aspects, in 
accordance with the “GRI Standards”, as stated in the paragraphs “About this Report” and “Definitions,  
Methodology and Scope” of the Sustainability Report.
