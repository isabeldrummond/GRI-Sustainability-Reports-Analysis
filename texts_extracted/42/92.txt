and reuse with minimal waste. We strive to recycle what cannot be

reused. If neither reuse nor recovery is possible, waste is disposed of  169.4 (-14% vs 2010)
using the method available that has the least environmental impact 
(waste-to-energy conversion or treatment) with landfills used only as a 
last resort. In 2018, 63 FCA plants sent zero waste to landfills.

As a result of continued improvements in waste management, FCA 
achieved a 4% reduction of waste generated in 2018 compared 
with 2017. In 2018, these efforts saved about €4 million. In addition, 
revenues of about €72 million were generated by selling recoverable 
waste to companies that use it to generate new products or energy.   2010  2016  2017  2018

Further, the Group carefully manages the amount of hazardous waste it 
generates - in accordance with applicable regulations in each jurisdiction 
- and places particular importance on reducing the generation of such

waste, since by its very nature it is often less suitable for recovery. PER VEHICLE PRODUCED

Through appropriate environmental practices, total hazardous waste 
decreased by 51% compared with 2010 baseline levels.
