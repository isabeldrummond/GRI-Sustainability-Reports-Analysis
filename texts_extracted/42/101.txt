OPERATIONS 
Responsible supply chain practices extend beyond purchasing  KEY FIGURES
and manufacturing automotive parts. Millions of parts and 
finished  products  must  be  transported  efficiently  to  their 
~200
destinations. Whether the destination is around the corner or 
around the world, we identify and implement new and efficient  low-emission natural gas
methods of moving components into plants, and vehicles to  trucks in FCA-owned fleet
dealers.
