FCA withdrawn and discharged water is considered as freshwater.
In addition to any legal requirements, FCA regularly measures and analyzes  certain heavy metals  in its wastewater when present in the manufacturing process, such as nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), cadmium 
(Cd) and copper (Cu). These analyses provide a comprehensive view of FCAâ€™s overall impact on water quality to maintain levels well below legal limits. No incident of non-compliance was recorded in 2018.
