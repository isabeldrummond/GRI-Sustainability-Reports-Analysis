FCA reports direct CO emissions based on direct energy consumption with the aid of the IPCC 2006 conversion factors. We report indirect CO emissions according to the standards and guidance 
2 2
outlined in the GHG Protocol and use the emissions factors updated by the International Energy Agency at the end of 2017 and other regionally published factors such as the eGRID in the U.S.
Indirect emissions were calculated using the market-based method.
Scope 2 emissions were also calculated using location-based methods, and in 2018 resulted in 2,795,995 tons of CO.

Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) other than CO have a negligible impact and are therefore not included. CO represents more than 99% of the Groupâ€™s total GHG emissions.
