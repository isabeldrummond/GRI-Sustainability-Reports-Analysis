(1) Data reported to NHTSA is provided by model year, the year used to designate a discrete vehicle model, irrespective of the calendar year in which the vehicle was actually produced, provided that the production 
period does not exceed 24 months. Fuel economy is based on the most recent NHTSA required submission, which for 2018 reflects mid-model year data. Previous year data in the table is adjusted to reflect final 
EPA/NHTSA reports.
(2) FCA’s import passenger car fuel economy was first reported in 2014, and includes both mass-market and luxury vehicles sold in the U.S., including Fiat, Maserati, Alfa Romeo and Ferrari brand vehicles. The spin-off 
of Ferrari from the Group was completed on January 3, 2016 and is included through 2015.
(3) Vehicles for the transportation of passengers and/or goods with specific characteristics defined by NHTSA (e.g., SUVs, MPVs and pickups).
