6.3  MONITORING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. 
  AN ONGOING COMMITMENT
Since 2015, Fastweb has monitored  franchised stores, the supply chain, distribution and 
its greenhouse gas emissions by  retrieval of equipment, customers’ use of services and 
calculating its carbon footprint. Using  product end-of-life35, assessing:
this methodology, the company can 
record its greenhouse gas emissions  1. Direct emissions due to Fastweb’s and its subsidiaries’ 
each year according to international guidelines, i.e.,  activities (such as the use of fuel for heating/cooling 
the “Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard” of  and use of company cars and car sharing) - Scope 1;
the Global Greenhouse Gas Protocol (the international 
standard for climate-changing emission monitoring)  2. Indirect emissions due to the acquisition of

activities but from greenhouse gas sources that

network infrastructure, Fastweb-owned stores and  organization - Scope 3.
