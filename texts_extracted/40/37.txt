Bari Matera 5G
THE INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE CONTINUES
THE PROJECT 
Bari Matera 5G is the project with which Fastweb, TIM and Huawei jointly submitted in 2017 the 
winning tender in the call by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development for experimentation 
with new 5G technology in these two cities. 
In 2018, the consortia formed by the three companies completed certain case studies using this 
technology: specifically, Fastweb worked directly on the following innovative applications that, 
in addition to demonstrating the technological potential of the 5G network, pave the way for 
new business models that will revolutionize these areas, transforming them into genuine digital 
laboratories.
