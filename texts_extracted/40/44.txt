Fastweb4School
WHEN IDEAS BECOME PROJECTS 
THE PROJECT 
Developed together with the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) and the 
support of the crowdfunding platform Produzioni dal Basso, the Fastweb4School project was 
created to promote and support digital initiatives in secondary schools, enabling students to 
gain hands-on experience in the creation of innovative projects in each and every stage, from 
fundraising, through development and to completion.
2018 saw the completion of the first stage of financing with the “Fastweb4Makers” call for ideas announced in 
December 2017 and devoted to the new digital craftspeople. The call focused on engineering, like the creation of 
electronic devices, robots, 3D printing devices and numerically controlled machines, in addition to objects created 
using digital technologies for the processing of metals, wood or other materials used in traditional crafts.
A commission consisting of Fastweb and the MIUR was responsible 
for the first part of the selection process and examined the proposals 
based on:
  the quality and originality of the ideas;
  the use of innovative and digital teaching methods; 
  the number of people involved;
  potential repercussions on local social and production components;
  the possibility of future development and application in other schools. 
The outcome of the selection process led to the identification of 38    
projects which then advanced to the next stage: crowdfunding on the 
Produzioni dal Basso platform. Of these, 33 effectively participated 
in the initiative, 19 of which managed to raise 50% of the funds they 
needed through crowdfunding and therefore received funding from 
Fastweb for the remaining 50%. 
A total of over €225,000 has been raised on this platform, roughly 
€100,000 of which funded by Fastweb to support initiatives ranging 
from the construction of open source computers and Formula 1 
models using 3D printing, to the development of artisanal robots and 
the creation of little FabLab in schools.
