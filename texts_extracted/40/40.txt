A video-surveillance system has been set up at  expected to help reduce traffic and emissions and 
the National Mount Vesuvius Park, reusing certain  to optimize the search for a parking space, while 
pre-existing video cameras partly integrated with  generating big data on mobility. The data generated 
new infrastructures and video cameras installed  will feed an analytics platform supporting the local 
for environmental control, as well as license plate  authorities’ analyses and decisions, which will in

technological solution, which can monitor 35 sites  car parks and mobility flows in the city.14
linked to three central operating stations, will keep 
the area under control and prevent criminal activity 
and critical situations.
 Presence Analytics 
Designed in partnership with the Turin municipal 
authorities, this solution analyses the data 
gathered via the public wi-fi infrastructure in the 
city of Turin. The data, after having been made 
anonymous, range from people counts to the 
analysis of mobility of flows, walkability indices 
and origin/destination matrices forming a set of 
statistics enabling the municipal authorities to 
analyze irregular concentrations of people that 
could compromise public order and to better plan 
public transport in the city.14
 FastSense 
This testing, the result of a partnership with the 
Turin municipal authorities, consists of monitoring 
the temperature, humidity, wind direction and 
intensity and the concentration of PM10, PM2.5, 
CO, NO2, VOC, ozone and SO2 in the air by installing 
weather stations in certain areas of the city to 
gauge these environmental parameters. It is one 
of the first solutions of its kind in Italy and includes 
noise sensors to measure the level of noise 
pollution. This information will feed an analytics 
platform supporting the local authorities’ analyses 
and decisions.14
14. The project will be realized within the first quarter 2019.
