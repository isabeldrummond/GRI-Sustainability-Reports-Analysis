job interviews and prepare the best curriculum vitae. As 
part of this initiative, the students were also asked to meet 
certain “challenges” relating to corporate welfare, CSR and 
marketing and design and propose their own solutions 
using digital tools and new technologies. In 2019, the 
winners will have internships at Fastweb as part of the 
student work experience program; they will also receive 
the exclusive opportunity to take a course at the Academy.
This project was not only limited to providing advice, but 
put participants to the test in real-life situations, providing 
invaluable training.
Furthermore, again in 2018, Fastweb participated in “Elle 
Active”, an initiative organized by Elle magazine to promote 
women’s talent with two workshops and 60 individual 
interviews with participants to provide suggestions to help 
them integrate digital skills into their training background.
