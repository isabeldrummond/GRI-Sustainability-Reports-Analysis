During 2019, Intesa Sanpaolo supported the first edition of the Global Health Festival, the event dedicated 
to confronting the great challenges of modern medicine on a global scale. The festival took place in Padua 
and focused on three main areas: health, economy and environment. During the sessions of the Festival 
many topics were addressed, like the scientific and institutional situation, the social determinants of health, 
environmental sustainability and the role of civil society and international cooperation. 60 events were held 
throughout the city and 80 speakers took part, including eminent figures from national and international 
scientific research.
In 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo joined "Tour della Salute" e "Crescendo in Salute", a travelling event that from May to 
October visited the piazzas of 14 Italian cities, with the aim of raising awareness of the importance of a healthy 
and balanced lifestyle in order to prevent chronic diseases. For the first year, the Bank is also supporting 
Campioni di Vita (Life Champions), a series of meetings aimed at upper secondary school students that will 
take place in six stages in as many Italian cities between November 2019 and February 2020 with the aim of 
raising awareness among young people of the values associated with sport, and in particular sports activities 
by those who are disabled.
In addition, the partnership with the Juniors Project of Armani Basket Milan and the Level I University Masters 
in Strategies for Sports Business was announced, organised by Verde Sport in conjunction with the Ca’ Foscari
