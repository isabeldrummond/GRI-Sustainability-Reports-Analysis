Indicators*
* The data relating to the 2018-2017 period is not comparable, particularly the indicators relating to Employees and the Environment, since the 2017 reporting boundary did not consider the 
aggregate set of the former Banca Popolare di Vicenza and the former Veneto Banca, included as of the 2018 Statement.
The data reported in the tables and charts may not add up exactly due to rounding differences.
