Letter to stakeholders
Also in 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo confirms its ability to position itself among the most solid and profitable European
banks, capable of generating benefits for all stakeholders and being the engine of inclusive and sustainable 
growth; the Group also continues to be the engine of the social economy in Italy.
In line with the commitments undertaken with the 2018-2021 Business Plan, the Group continues to act as a 
point of reference in social, cultural and environmental sustainability, as evidenced by its positioning within the 
main sustainability indices and rankings. Intesa Sanpaolo is indeed the only Italian bank to feature in the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Indices, in the CDP Climate A List and in the Corporate Knights ranking of the world’s 100 
most sustainable companies.  
In 2019, the Group's commitment to sustainability was further strengthened by joining three important United 
Nations initiatives, which are part of the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals: the Principles 
for Responsible Banking, launched in September 2019 to bring the banking sector closer to the Sustainable 
Development Goals and those set in the 2015 Paris climate agreement; the Principles for Sustainable 
Insurance, with the participation of Intesa Sanpaolo Vita, for the inclusion of sustainability and ESG criteria 
also in the insurance business; and finally the Women's Empowerment Principles, for the promotion of gender 
equality and women's professional development. With the Principles for Responsible Investments, signed by 
Eurizon as early as 2015, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group is one of the few European financial groups to have 
joined all the main United Nations initiatives related to its business in the field of sustainability.  
Intesa Sanpaolo continues to be a driving force in the growth of Italy’s real economy with approximately 58 
billion euro in new medium/long-term loans in 2019, approximately 48 billion euro of which was disbursed in 
Italy, and around 38 billion of which was granted to households and SMEs. The Group is a point of reference for 
all companies capable of overcoming conditions of temporary difficulty: in 2019 about 18,500 Italian companies 
returned from non-performing to performing status, protecting around 93,000 jobs.
The ability to act as the engine of sustainable and inclusive development is also substantiated with the Group's 
disbursements for social and environmental purposes, equal to approximately 6 billion euro in 2019 and 
accounting for over 10% of the total: approximately 3.8 billion euro is comprised of high-social impact loans 
and around 2.2 billion euro is directed towards supporting the green economy and the circular economy.  
The high-social impact loans include microcredit and anti-usury initiatives (75 million), support for social 
enterprises and the non-profit sector (over 200 million), subsidised loans for communities and people impacted 
by natural disasters and emergencies (over 135 million) and loans to vulnerable categories or those who find it 
difficult to access credit (3.4 billion). The commitment to ensuring credit access to excluded individuals or those 
who are unlikely to fall within the traditional financial channels has also translated into "per Merito", the first 
initiative activated by Fund for Impact, with 28 million euro being granted to over 3,200 students. Investment in 
young people, their education and job promotion is also tangible in the Giovani e Lavoro programme, created 
in collaboration with Generation Italy, a job orientation project involving 1,000 companies and training 700 
young people in the classroom.
In the context of the loans for the green economy and the circular economy, 2019 saw the launch of the activity 
envisaged in the 5 billion credit plafond dedicated to the circular economy: out of approximately 250 projects 
analysed, around 60 were funded for a total amount of 760 million, based on criteria developed in partnership 
with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. The first 750 million Sustainability Bond successfully placed by the Bank 
in November 2019 is dedicated to the circular economy, following the Green Bond issued in 2017 for 500 
million euro, entirely allocated for the funding of 77 projects, which allowed an annual saving of more than 
353,000 tonnes of CO  emissions.

Furthermore, Intesa Sanpaolo has continued to pursue its strategic commitments in terms of digitisation and 
multichannel projects, maintaining the centrality of the customer, the care of the relationship and the excellence 
of the service offered as its primary objective, establishing itself as Italy's leading digital bank and among the 
top three European banks with around 9.2 million multi-channel customers, equal to over 78% of its customer 
base. In the belief that the innovation challenge in Italy plays a role of primary importance in the development 
of the new economy, the Group has continued with its start-up development and enhancement programme, 
activating 6 acceleration programmes on over 120 start-ups.
