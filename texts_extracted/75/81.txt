SUPPORTING PRODUCTION AND INNOVATION
Intesa Sanpaolo puts itself forward as a point of reference, and not just financially, to support the country's 
economic system in every phase of the economy, even in the most delicate areas, for the business and 
associative world, helping its customers in a consolidated and long-term model founded on quality, reliability 
and trust.
With regard to over a million of companies and 200,000 SME customers, the Group puts forward solutions 
that support the future of Made in Italy in the world and contribute to sharing their internationalisation, 
capitalisation, innovation and development processes, with particular attention to the topic of economic, 
social and environmental sustainability, as stated in the 2018-2021 Business Plan.
SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES 
In 2019, Intesa Sanpaolo allocated about 58 billion euro of new medium-long term loans to the real economy. 
Around 48 billion euro was granted in Italy, 38 billion euro of which to households and SMEs.
In 2019 the Group facilitated the return from non-performing to performing status of around 18,500 Italian 
companies, with a positive impact on employment through the protection of approximately 93,000 jobs.
The internationalisation process of Italian businesses is supported, directly or through the Group’s main 
subsidiaries abroad, by:
 Group network with presence of branches and offices in around 40 countries worldwide and coverage across 
85 countries thanks to agreements with other Banks;
 a service model that leverages specialised product expertise (trade finance, cash management and 
internationalisation), the presence of specialised desks (Corporate Desk and Multinational Clients Desk), 
with consultancy provided by specialists in financial support and Trade and Cash Management needs;
 an offering of domestic and cross-border products, which, in the purely transactional area, aims to offer 
corporate customers the opportunities (open banking) offered by the entry into force of PSD2.
To promote the international development of businesses Intesa Sanpaolo also organises various types 
of events in Italy and accompanies businesses on missions abroad in cooperation with various partners, 
institutional bodies and trade associations.
The growth of Italian SMEs is also supported by the Intesa Sanpaolo Structured Finance and Advisory units 
and the partnership with Elite of Borsa Italiana, supporting the growth and investment plans of virtuous SMEs 
through innovative financial solutions that give companies high visibility to institutional investors and enhance 
their reputation and financial culture.
In partnership with Confindustria, in 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo brought 67 companies representing Italy and 
economic sectors to three Elite Lounges (an international programme to accompany the most ambitious 
companies in their development phases), one of which was dedicated to women's entrepreneurship and 
another one that saw the involvement of some finalists in the Imprese Vincenti programme.
In 2019, in partnership with Elite, the Intesa Sanpaolo Basket Bond Programme was set up, an operation 
to allow SMEs to issue bonds and subsequent securitisation through "Notes" to institutional investors. The 
Programme, structured in several tranches, provides for the subscription of bonds for a total amount of up to 1 
billion euro and seeks to involve a total of about 200 SMEs throughout Italy. 
With regard to the financing of SMEs we note our efforts in the world of culture, and in particular the film world 
and the advance tax credit, thus giving substance to the important new development introduced by Italian 
Cinema Law no. 220/2016 (assignability of the tax credit) and responding to the pressing demand of industry 
operators.
IMPRESE VINCENTI PROGRAMME
In 2019, the Group launched the first edition of Imprese Vincenti, the programme to promote Italian 
entrepreneurial excellence, i.e. small and medium-sized enterprises that stand out nationally for growth 
and creation of value and jobs. The aim is to provide media visibility and services to accompany growth, 
in collaboration with important partners and with the support of the Intesa Sanpaolo Formazione 
companies, Intesa Sanpaolo Forvalue and Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center. The first edition saw 
excellent results, with about 1,800 companies nominated and 120 companies selected and celebrated 
as winning companies.
