With the aim of continuing to support businesses and respond to the developments occurring within the 
European regulatory context, and with the "Imprese in Ripresa 2.0" ("Recovering companies") initiative, 
operational since January 2019, the new Credit Agreement signed by ABI and the main trade associations 
introduced adjustments to the SME loan suspension and extension measures set out in the previous Credit 
Agreement of 2015.

Furthermore, after 10 years of cooperation with Confindustria Piccola Industria, a partnership born as a

2019 three-year agreement "Designing the future" dedicated to competitiveness and digital transformation of

Within the context of Industry 4.0, in 2019 support for SMEs took the form of over 601.9 million euro of loans 
issued in response to over 2,229 requests processed.
Agreements and partnerships have been established with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the 
European Investment Fund (EIF), and the use of the EIB funds still available and linked to the agreements 
signed – for a total of 1,035 million euro – has continued to be used to support investments by SMEs in 
all sectors, to finance energy efficiency projects in the public, industrial and residential sectors carried out 
throughout the country mainly by energy service companies (so-called ESCOs). In October, two further 
agreements were signed with the EIB for two loans of 100 million euro each, the first for SMEs and Midcap 
companies operating in the agriculture and bio-economy sectors, and the second for the financing of small and 
medium-sized renewable energy projects in Italy in the wind, geothermal, biomass and photovoltaic sectors.
The agreement with the EIF calls for the creation of a portfolio with an InnovFin guarantee for new loans of 
up to 300 million euro for research, innovation and development projects, and continued in 2019 with the 
construction of portfolios of new financing guaranteed by the SME Guarantee Fund. Operations which began 
in 2018 with the admission of four portfolios for a total value of loans of 1.2 billion euro, continued in July 2019 
with a new initiative that benefits from the guarantees of the consortium company promoted by Confcommercio
