within the regional territory. 
In the same way, although the activities carried out by Intesa Sanpaolo employees do not in any way expose 
employees to dust and materials containing asbestos, in 2019 the Safety and Protection Head Office Department 
once again carried out a specific risk assessment for all workspaces. The periodic checks according to the 
timeframes established by law, carried out by a Qualified Expert in the Management and Control of materials 
containing asbestos, confirmed that there is no contamination: all of the values measured are lower than the 
threshold established by the laws in force and similar to those present in the external environment. 
WASTE MANAGEMENT
For the purposes of managing the waste produced at the Group's sites, the Italian territory was divided into 
a number of lots where companies specialised in waste collection, sorting and disposal activities operate. 
These companies are subject to an evaluation process during which the authorisations required to operate 
as transporters (by means of vehicles entered on the relevant register) and recipients are also acquired. The 
various types of special waste are managed on the basis of their specific characteristics, while for separately 
collected waste such as paper, plastic and glass, compliance with the provisions issued locally applies.
Similarly, in other countries, waste collection and management takes place in compliance with the reference 
national legislation. 
In 2019, the special waste produced by the Group totalled 4,290 tonnes (45.1 kg per staff member), a slight 
increase compared with 2018. The increase is mainly attributable to the disposal of properties and consequently 
of IT equipment and archives outside Italy.
Only 6.8% of waste is disposed of in landfills, 0.5% is incinerated with energy recovery, and the remaining 
92.7% is recycled or reused/recovered.
