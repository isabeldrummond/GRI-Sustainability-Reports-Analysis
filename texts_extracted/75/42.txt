The risk management system also involves the identification, understanding and monitoring of so-called 
emerging risks, i.e. risks characterised by components that are scarcely known or rapidly evolving, potentially 
significant in the medium term to the Group’s financial position and business model, even though their effects are 
not easy to assess and cannot yet be fully integrated into the most consolidated risk management frameworks. 
In this perspective, the outlook for global economic growth shows significant vulnerabilities and downside risks, 
primarily relating to the uncertainty of the recovery of global trade and manufacturing and geopolitical tensions 
remaining high. In addition, the spread of COVID-19, with its implications for public health, the economy and 
trade, may have a significant dampening effect on global growth.
MONITORING OF ESG AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS 
In accordance with its approach to Corporate Social Responsibility and the principles outlined in the Code of Ethics, 
the Intesa Sanpaolo Group is aware of the importance of the correct and responsible allocation of resources, following 
social and environmental sustainability criteria. Therefore, it promotes balanced development that can redirect capital 
flows towards sustainable investments that balance interests like the preservation of the natural environment, health, 
work, the well-being of the whole community and the safeguarding of the system of social relations.
To this end, it takes into account social, environmental and governance risks ESG (environmental, social and 
governance) associated with the activities of customer companies and pays particular attention to the study of 
sustainability issues related to sectors considered to be sensitive, i.e. those having a significant risk. 
In particular, the monitoring of these risks provides for:
 their inclusion in the Risk Management framework, with particular reference to the Governance of Reputational 
Risks1 and the Management of the Most Significant Transactions2;
1 Reputational risk is defined as the current or prospective risk of a decrease in profits or capital due to a negative perception of the Bank’s image by customers, counterparties, bank 
shareholders, investors and Supervisory Authorities.
2 Transactions of particular importance, of a proprietary type or with individual customers or counterparties, potentially capable of having a significant impact on the overall risk profile 
and/or the specific risks of the Group.
