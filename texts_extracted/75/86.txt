Furthermore, as part of the activities in support of the acceleration programmes, the partnership continued 
with B-Heroes, an acceleration, mentorship, investment and communication programme aimed at innovative 
start-ups, which reached its third edition in 2019 with the involvement of over 1,000 start-ups and over 500 
meetings in the area.
For digital learning, the "Officine Formative" project provides online acceleration courses for early-stage start-
ups aimed at providing the necessary entrepreneurial skills, free of charge, to create and launch a start-up on 
the market and raise capital from investors. There are 21 courses on the site, with over 100 lessons on various 
topics. So far, over 1,750 hours of lessons have been provided on the website to over 3,900 registered users.
In order to support the growth of start-ups, international expansion programmes with assistance and consultancy 
services are also carried out to support the growth of start-ups abroad. Business development services were 
offered in the analysis of the potential target markets and competitionâ€™s characteristics, as well as identifying 
the most suitable business opportunities and technological solutions.
Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center has created a qualitative assessment model to support the Bank's credit 
granting process to innovative start-ups in the Company Register. The Diligence Assessment Tool Scorecard 
(DATS) associates traditional credit assessment based on economic and financial aspects with a long-term 
vision that harnesses the growth potential of start-ups.
