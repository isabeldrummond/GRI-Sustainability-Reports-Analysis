STRATEGY
Intesa Sanpaolo is aware that a large banking group has a significant influence in terms of environmental and social 
sustainability, both in the short and long term. In fact, in addition to directly managing energy consumption with a 
view to increasing efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in its buildings, Intesa Sanpaolo can exert an 
influence on activities and behaviour that it cannot directly control, in particular those of customers and suppliers.
Intesa Sanpaolo's climate strategy is mainly oriented towards the promotion of sustainable financial instruments to 
support the transition to a low-carbon economic model. Indeed, the integration of climate considerations into the 
provision of financial services can have a significant impact and contribute significantly to the fight against climate 
change.  
Intesa Sanpaolo has a diversified business model – with revenues from financing, investment, insurance underwriting 
and asset management – serving the various sectors of the economy at an international level. This breadth and 
diversification helps on the one hand to reduce the Group's vulnerability to different specific aspects of climate 
risk and to take advantage of a wide range of climate-related opportunities, but on the other hand it increases the 
breadth of analysis and action to be taken with respect to the transition to a low-carbon economy. 
In 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo started participating in the working group TCFD Banking Sector Pilot - Phase II, which 
involves more than 35 international banks coordinated by UNEP FI, with the aim of developing methods for the 
assessment of risks related to climate change through the performance of long-term scenario analysis. In particular, 
this method of analysis is applied to certain sectors of the Group's credit portfolio that are sensitive to climate 
change, in order to quantify the impact of both transition risk and physical risk.
 
RISK MANAGEMENT
Intesa Sanpaolo takes into account the social, environmental and governance risks, associated with the activities of 
its customer companies and the economic activities it invests in and pays particular attention to the in-depth study 
of sustainability issues related to sectors considered sensitive, i.e. those with a significant socio-environmental risk. 
In this context, the Bank pays particular attention to the risk arising from climate change (both physical risk and 
transition risk).
Key activities in climate risk management concern:
 the identification, assessment and measurement of such risks;
 the implementation, development and monitoring of a company-wide risk management framework, including 
risk culture, risk appetite and credit limits.
With the support of a cross-functional working group, the Chief Risk Officer Area and the Chief Financial Officer 
Area are responsible for identifying and analysing the range of risks and opportunities related to climate change in 
order to incorporate them into the ordinary processes of risk assessment and monitoring and credit strategies, and 
for setting objectives and guidelines to implement actions to manage and mitigate these risks. 
Within the Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), the Group has introduced a specific reference to climate risk, working 
to develop its integration into the existing risk management framework with particular reference to credit risk and 
reputational risk.
In 2019 work began on identifying the business sectors in the credit portfolio that are potentially most affected by 
climate risk, both from transition risk and physical risk, in order to quantify the Group's exposure to these risks. The 
work follows the TCFD approach, i.e. the logic of financial materiality (impact of climate change on the value of the 
counterparty and consequently on credit risk). 
The potential impacts, the related time horizon (short, medium, long) and the mitigation and adaptation actions 
taken for each potential risk observed are identified annually, with reference to both indirect and direct risks.
