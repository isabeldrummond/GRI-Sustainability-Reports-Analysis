The highest number of reports came from customers (98), followed by those from employees (31). The category 
having the greatest impact in the area of customer complaints concerns the difficulty of access to branches or 
online services by people with disabilities (18 reports), in particular due to the complexities of access channels. 
There are 13 complaints related to products deemed to be incorrectly offered, which are often caused by a 
lack of understanding of certain products by customers who are increasingly diverse in age, origin and culture. 
There are 31 reports received from employees, 22 of which come from abroad, regarding conflicts at work, 
difficulties in integration for workers with disabilities and – on the foreign front – reports of alleged irregularities. 
Non-discrimination issues were constantly and carefully monitored in 2019 as well.
 The dissemination of the culture of sustainability: the collection of 9 pieces of training modules (videos 
and training fiction) on the values and principles of the Code of Ethics made available in 2018 was further 
expanded in 2019 with 6 new items dedicated to the analysis of sustainability issues within Intesa Sanpaolo, 
like the challenge related to climate change, human rights, financial inclusion and sustainable investments. 
The course on financial inclusion and the role played by the Group had about 29,600 views, while the 
remaining had at least 2,000 views each. Moreover, a new training plan dedicated to CSR Delegates of 
the International Subsidiary Banks Division was launched in 2019 with a specific focus on issues and 
activities related to the integration of sustainability in the organisation. The first two modules were dedicated 
respectively to ISO 26000, GRI Standards and reporting quality requirements. Each session involved a 
total of 15 participants. During the year training sessions also continued for the structures involved in the 
management of complaints and customer satisfaction of the International Subsidiary Banks Division, aimed 
at identifying and reporting potential breaches of the Code of Ethics. The 2019 editions involved Intesa 
Sanpaolo Bank Albania and Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Romania for a total of more than 450 participants.
Compliance with the principles and values of the Code of Ethics was monitored with the support of the Chief 
Audit Officer, so that it could be reported annually to the Management Control Committee and the Surveillance 
Body pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001. Checks were conducted on 15 risk areas that also 
considered social and environmental responsibility aspects and implications including: 
 Transactions with Related Parties and associated entities; 
 Personnel remuneration and incentive systems (in various Group companies); 
 Reporting on the Research and Development Special Fund financing and more generally the disbursement 
of loans (involving an assessment of social and environmental elements) in specific segments or business 
areas (New York Hub - Structured Finance Desk); 
 Checks on the methods of data collection and management for the Consolidated Non-financial Statement; 
 Management of purchasing procedures (i.e. centralised purchasing or for specific companies and activities), 
of monitoring and qualification of suppliers and of processes concerning specific categories of suppliers 
(infoprovider);
 Role and activities of the subsidiaries ISPIC Spa and Neva Finventures Spa, for some aspects related to the 
circular economy;
 Sponsorships and local donations (assessments of some specific entities). 
The audits did not identify any particular breaches or critical issues.
