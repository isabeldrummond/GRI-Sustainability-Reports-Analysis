Governance and management of risks 102-33
 their assessment within the processes related to the implementation of the Equator Principles1 and Reputational 
Risk Clearing;
 a specific focus on reputational and climate change risks within the "Risk Appetite Framework"2; 
 the definition of the list of "sensitive" sectors with reference to ESG and reputational risks and subject to self-
regulatory policies.
Among the sensitive sectors, the production and trade of arms is of particular importance and is subject to 
internal regulation. Specifically, in keeping with the values and principles expressed in the Code of Ethics and 
aware of the need to support national and European defence together with the allied countries in NATO, the 
Intesa Sanpaolo Group, with regard to the activities of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, does not support 
operations that relate to the production and/or trade of military goods, even if permitted by applicable law, in 
countries that do not belong to the European Union and/or NATO. 
Any operations in countries which do not belong to the European Union or NATO shall be submitted for 
approval to Intesa Sanpaolo’s Managing Director and CEO, after consultation with the Chief Compliance 
Officer, who shall assess such requests, having regard in particular to the existence of intergovernmental 
programmes with the Republic of Italy.
The company rules also prohibit the undertaking of any kind of banking or lending activity related to the 
production of and/or trade in controversial weapons and/or those banned by international treaties and in 
particular: nuclear, biological and chemical weapons; cluster and fragmentation bombs; weapons containing 
depleted uranium; and anti-personnel landmines. In addition to the provisions already adopted by Intesa 
Sanpaolo by its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, in accordance with the provisions of Italian Law 185/1990, 
in 2017 specific rules were issued for the Group’s International Subsidiary Banks that provide a ban on the 
support to any operation related to the production and/or trade of military goods, with the exception of military 
supplies provided by the Bank’s customers to the Armed and/or Police Forces of the Country to which a 
Subsidiary Bank belongs. 
The operations of the Group's Branches and International Subsidiary Banks are also subject to local regulations, 
when they are stricter than the Group regulations.
REPUTATIONAL RISK GOVERNANCE MODEL 
The reputational risk governance model of Intesa Sanpaolo envisages that management and mitigation of 
reputational risks is pursued:
 through compliance with standards of ethics and conduct by all employees: the Code of Ethics adopted by 
the Group contains the core values that Intesa Sanpaolo intends to commit itself to and sets out the voluntary 
principles of conduct for dealings with all stakeholders (customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, 
the environment and, more generally, the community) with even broader objectives than those required by 
current legislation. As already noted, the Group has also issued voluntary conduct policies (human rights 
policy, environmental policy and arms industry policy) and adopted international principles (UN Global 
Compact, UNEP FI, Equator Principles) aimed at pursuing respect for the environment and human rights;
 systematically and independently by the structures tasked with safeguarding the company reputation, which 
maintain relations with stakeholders, within their respective areas of responsibility;
 across the various corporate functions, through the Reputational Risk Management processes coordinated by 
the Chief Risk Officer Governance Area. In this context, in addition to the Clearing process, better described 
in the dedicated section, we would mention Reputational Risk Monitoring to monitor the evolution of Intesa 
Sanpaolo’s reputational positioning over time, and identify the main areas of exposure, above all through 
periodic analysis of its web reputation, and the Reputational Risk Assessment with which Top Managers 
identify the main reputational risk scenarios the Group is exposed to;
 with an integrated monitoring system for primary risks (like credit risk, operational risks, market risks) to limit 
exposure to those risks, and compliance with the related limits contained in the Risk Appetite Framework.
The Group aims to achieve constant improvement of reputational risk governance also through an integrated 
compliance risk management system, as it considers compliance with the regulations and fairness in business 
to be fundamental to the conduct of banking operations, which by nature are founded on trust.
1 The Equator Principles (EP or Principles) are international Guidelines (that financial institutions adhere to on a voluntary basis) for the management of socio-environmental risks 
arising from project financing. The Principles are based on the criteria of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank (the Performance Standards), which concern, 
amongst other issues: the assessment of social and environmental impacts; the protection of workers' rights; the exclusion of child labour and forced labour; the prevention of pollution 
and the promotion of energy efficiency; risks to the health and safety of communities; the consultation of the populations concerned and protection of their rights; safeguarding 
biodiversity and the sustainable management of natural resources; and the preservation of cultural heritage.
2 The RAF represents the overall framework within which corporate risk management is developed, and is divided into (i) general principles of risk appetite; (ii) monitoring of the Group's 
Overall Risk Profile; (iii) monitoring of the Group's Main Specific Risks.
