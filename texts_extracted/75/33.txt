Governance structure
Intesa Sanpaolo adopts the "one-tier" management and control model, in which the management and control 
functions are exercised, respectively, by the Board of Directors and the Management Control Committee set 
up within it, both appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting. 
Detailed information on the corporate governance system and remuneration – including references to diversity 
in the Board of Directors – is provided in the “Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structures” 
and in the “Report on Remuneration” published on the Bank’s website, to which reference should be made.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors is tasked with corporate management and may undertake all transactions considered 
necessary, useful or appropriate in achieving the corporate purpose, both of an ordinary and extraordinary 
nature. It performs strategic guidance and supervision functions for the Company and resolves on all the 
most important corporate deeds. The Managing Director and CEO is the Chief Executive Officer and General 
Manager and supervises the company’s management to the extent of his/her assigned powers, in compliance 
with the general planning and strategic guidelines set forth by the Board. The Chairman of the Board of 
Directors oversees the work of the Board, organises and directs the activity and performs all the tasks set 
by the supervisory regulations. He/She has a non-executive role and does not carry out, not even de facto, 
management functions. 
Within the Board* there is a Management Control Committee, appointed by the shareholders' meeting, which 
is made up of five independent directors pursuant to the Articles of Association and exercises the control 
functions also as an internal control and audit committee (pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree no. 39/2010).
The Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of 30 April 2019 set the number of members of the Board of Directors at 
19, appointing directors for the three-year term of office on the basis of the lists submitted by shareholders. 
Subsequently, following the resignation tendered by a director in November 2019, during the meeting of 2 
December 2019 the Board of Directors co-opted a new member, who shall remain in office until the meeting 
called for the approval of the 2019 financial statements.
All directors are non-executive, with the exception of the Managing Director and CEO, 14 directors are 
independent. Minority shareholders are adequately represented (5 members) and present in all Board 
Committees with the chairmanship of the Management Control Committee and the Committee for Transactions 
with Related Parties. The Directors meet the requirements of fitness for office required by the regulations of 
reference and the provisions of the Articles of Association. 
Following are the Board Committees which are composed of five directors, the majority of whom are 
independent, are chaired by independent directors and provide support to the Board of Directors, with the duty 
of performing investigations, providing advice and making proposals: 
 Nominations Committee;
 Remuneration Committee;
 Risks Committee;
 Committee for Transactions with Related Parties and Associated Entities.
RESPONSIBILITIES AND DIVERSITY OF THE MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL BODIES
According to Intesa Sanpaolo's Articles of Association, the Board shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure 
that each Director, and the Board as a whole, have a continually adequate level of diversification, including in 
terms of experience, age, gender and international orientation, in addition to competence, fairness, reputation, 
independence of mind, and time commitment. 
In the document on the qualitative and quantitative composition of the Board of Directors published on the Bank's 
website in February 2019, in view of the renewal of the Corporate Bodies the shareholders were asked to ensure 
that the new Board of Directors had the broadest gender diversity with adequate professional skills, as well as a 
diversity of age brackets amongst Directors, in addition to a comprehensive level of knowledge and experience. 
With particular reference to the adequacy and diversity of the professional profiles required, a "Skills Directory" 
has been drawn up in the document cited outlining the set of experiences, knowledge and skills – very good or 
distinctive, with a very broad, intermediate or limited dissemination – that are considered appropriate to achieve 
the optimal qualitative composition of the new Board of Directors of Intesa Sanpaolo. The skills and expertise 
were subsequently strengthened and supplemented on the basis of training programs as well as of the intensive 
induction plan for both the new directors (onboarding) and the entire Board.
For further information on the skills declared by the individual directors at a distinctive level, reference is made to the 
Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structures (page 14 [i]).
