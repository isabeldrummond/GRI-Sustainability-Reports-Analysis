Quality and innovation in customer relations
COMPANY POLICIES
In keeping with the values and principles of conduct defined in the Code of Ethics, which are based on 
listening and dialogue, transparency and fairness, and the protection of safety in business relations, the 
Group places its focus on the customer and strives to maintain excellent relationships. These values and 
principles are incorporated in the essential standards of behaviour set out in the Group’s Internal Code 
of Conduct that commits Board members, employees and other staff to comply with them. In addition, for 
specific areas of activity governing the quality of customer relations, there are governance Guidelines 
and rules based on the initiation of processes which, adopting models involving high levels of protection, 
shape conduct according to criteria of considerable good faith and fairness in relations. Customer health 
and safety aspects are also monitored with policies that establish principles and rules of conduct and 
define responsibilities in operational relations, both in branches and on the digital channel.
SERVICE QUALITY
Intesa Sanpaolo has adopted a service model focused on business areas with an organisational structure that 
guarantees monitoring in both Italy and the other countries in which it operates. The Divisions are responsible 
for developing the best quality service levels through the various channels, in order to improve the efficiency of 
the commercial products they offer to the various types of customers. Customer satisfaction and service quality 
are monitored and overseen by the structures that deal with customer satisfaction and customer experience 
in the various business Divisions.
LISTENING TO RETAIL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS IN ITALY
Customer Experience surveys represent a decisive aspect of the strategic vision of the Banca dei Territori Division 
because by listening to the customer it is possible to identify factors of satisfaction and dissatisfaction and areas for 
improvement requiring action.
The Division implements the following methods:
 monitoring the Net Satisfaction Index (NSI) to detect customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction through suggestions 
and the identification of opportunities for improvement in products and services;  
measurement of the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which indicates people’s likelihood to recommend the 
Bank; the establishment and monitoring of indicators of the quality provided and measured through three 
indices (excellence in service, operations and credit) whose results, together with the NPS, form the basis 
of the SEIok programme and contribute to the determination of the Variable Results Bonus of the branches 
and areas of the Banca dei Territori Division, accounting for 25% of the Synthetic Performance Indicator.
In addition to ongoing surveys, there are also specific in-depth surveys to develop strategies aimed at different 
customer targets. Nine surveys were carried out in response to specific requirements or to examine particular issues 
and allowed the gathering of 14,000 pieces of feedback.
In 2019, new product Customer Satisfaction surveys were also launched thanks to which over 54,000 responses were 
collected. These surveys make it possible to monitor satisfaction with individual products over time and to collect any 
suggestions for improvement from customers, complementing Customer Experience surveys.
To align the Employee Experience with the Customer Experience, the Division monitors satisfaction with tools and 
services using the Internal Service Quality (ISQ) survey carried out on Network staff. The survey, now in its third 
edition, involved about 18,000 employees and collected almost 9,000 responses.
Furthermore, in order to measure internal satisfaction regarding commercial and relationship issues, during 2019 a 
total of approximately 240,000 questionnaires were sent to Group employees and more than 133,000 responses were 
collected. Analysis of the results of these surveys made it possible to better understand employees, with the aim of 
supporting them both in carrying out their daily activities and developing/strengthening relationships with customers.
The listening process is continuously evolving and expanding. Indeed, the scope of the Net Promoter Score (NPS) 
survey has been extended to the world of Retail Businesses and to companies belonging to the Third Sector (Impact 
Department). In the event of significant discontinuities like a corporate merger it is in fact essential to use the listening 
activities extensively in order to better monitor the quality of the Customer Experience, identifying specific actions 
where appropriate.
