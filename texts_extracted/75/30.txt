MATRIX VALIDATION
All the issues that are significant (i.e. that have a score of 3 or higher, on a scale from 0 to 5) for the company and/
or for at least one of its stakeholders are material and have been reported in this document. 
Each one is assessed in terms of its positive and negative impact on internal and external stakeholders and 
the company structures, and on the basis of potential associated business risks/opportunities. The reporting 
boundaries are also stated for each issue (see page 215). The Materiality Matrix was shared with the Risks 
Committee, which forms part of the Board of Directors, and with the Steering Committee, in order to present 
feedback provided by company units concerning these activities to the governing bodies.
ANALYSIS OF MATERIAL ISSUES IN THE WIDER CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABILITY 
The results represented in the Materiality Matrix were examined in terms of their consistency with a context 
analysis on general sustainability issues and a sector analysis at national and international level. This analysis 
was also updated through the critical reading of the most relevant documents focused on sustainable finance 
published in 2019.
The 2019 context analysis was enriched, compared to previous years, with the findings that emerged from the 
use of a platform that employs a large database of information relating to sustainability and ESG issues, allowing 
the identification and sorting of Intesa Sanpaolo material topics based on the frequency with which they were 
founding the following sources:
 annual financial and sustainability reports and public statements attributable to the banking sector worldwide;
 European standards (mandatory and voluntary) referable to the banking services sector which entered into 
force or changed since 2000. 
The results of the analysis essentially confirmed the aspects that emerged in 2018, also as regards the risks and 
opportunities.
As regards national and international trends and objectives, additional aspects were identified to take into account 
the relevance that issues such as sustainable finance and the fight against climate change had in 2019.
