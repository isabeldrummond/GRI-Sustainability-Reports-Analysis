In 2019, Eurizon carried out 675 engagement initiatives with 515 issuers, with about 15% (102 initiatives with 
77 companies) primarily related to ESG issues.
Compared to 2018 (600 engagement initiatives, of which 22% on ESG issues), in 2019 there was a lower 
incidence of engagement with issuers specifically dedicated to ESG issues due to a lower number of renewals 
of the corporate bodies of Italian companies and a lower number of critical issuers in the portfolio.
At the end of the engagement activity (18 months of monitoring), the process of disinvesting all securities (50 
issuers) which did not provide proof of convincing actions that may have a short-term effect on the sustainability 
profile began at the start of 2019. The only exceptions were four issuers for whom the engagement process 
was extended.
With regard to active share ownership activities, the asset management company adheres to the Italian 
Stewardship Principles for the responsible exercising of the administrative and voting rights of listed companies, 
with the commitment to promote high standards of corporate governance. These rights are exercised 
transparently in the interest of the portfolio subscribers and market integrity, while maintaining a strong focus 
on limiting potential conflicts of interest.
In 2019, Eurizon Capital SGR took part in 100 shareholders’ meetings of select companies listed on Borsa 
Italiana (55%) and the international markets (45%), voting on around 920 resolutions on the agenda.
In terms of actively managed funds, specialised ESG products which use a proprietary rating platform were 
developed and offered to the public.
The total number of these funds was 33 products (compared to 21 funds in 2018), with issue windows for 
different deadlines of the two product families Eurizon Disciplina Sostenibile and Eurizon Flessibile Azionario.
There were 12 new products in 2019 (compared to 11 in 2018). Specifically, the new Megatrend line mutual 
funds were launched: Eurizon Planet, Eurizon People and Eurizon Innovation.
During 2019 the Eurizon ESG products (EF Bond Corporate Smart ESG and EF Sustainable Global Equity) 
were introduced to International Subsidiary Banks (CIB Bank, VÚB Banka, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank in Slovenia) 
supported by training and an educational event in Slovenia.
EURIZON FUND ABSOLUTE GREEN BONDS - GLOBAL IMPACT REPORT [i]
In September 2019, the asset management company drafted the third Global Impact Report regarding 
Eurizon Fund Absolute Green Bonds, which details the results of the quantitative impact analysis and 
the contribution to the UN’s SDGs. The investments made during the analysis period (30 September 
2018 - 30 September 2019) helped achieve key environmental and social impact results, such as:
 a generating capacity of 116 megawatts, thanks to the financing of plants that produce renewable 
energy; these plants produced around 138,600 megawatt/hours of energy;
 energy savings of around 12.45 million kilowatt/hours thanks to investments in sustainable infrastructure 
(real estate and transport);
 a reduction in annual emissions of harmful gases of over 94,000 tonnes of CO ;
2
 the saving and purification of over 26,600 million litres of water through investments in plants and 
production processes;
 the recycling of 3,288 tonnes of waste;
 69 jobs created by the entire portfolio.
For every million euro invested, the following results are obtained: 303 megawatt/hours produced, 
58,537 litres of water saved or purified, 206 tonnes of CO  saved.
