EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT
In 2019 the Ottomila! change management system consolidated the support activity involving about 44,500 
employees in the achievement of the objectives of the 2018-2021 Business Plan within Banca dei Territori. 
Ottomila! is based on listening, participation and involvement of employees in activities on the website in 
a process of co-creation of initiatives and KPIs designed to enhance the contribution of each of them. In 
2019, a tool called Altimetro (Altimeter) was used with branches and offices for quarterly surveys (96,979 
questionnaires completed in 4 surveys in 2019) to enable employees to propose and implement initiatives in 
order to improve work.
With the Vividigitale project, the spread of digital culture continued in a context of profound transformation 
through formats dedicated to employees and customers, and in particular 5,823 digital culture promoters 
identified in the branches and management offices, points of reference for employees and customers, involved 
in 122 in-depth sessions. The shared content was then presented to customers through information and direct 
support through 70 dedicated events organised in the branches with new layouts, better suited to hosting this 
type of meeting.
THE PHYSICAL NETWORK CHANNEL AND INTEGRATION WITH ONLINE STRUCTURES
The branches continue to represent the physical space of personal relationships of the distribution network, 
particularly with regard to more complex operations. The New Branch Layout project has led to significant 
changes in the physical place where the Bank comes into contact with its customers with modular spaces that 
have been made as welcoming as possible and functional areas for specific activities (booths, co-working), and 
are also suitable for hosting artistic and cultural events. At the end of 2019 the new branch model was available 
in 229 branches, including 7 corporate branches, which have hosted around 450 events and engaged around 
15,000 customers.
As outlined in the 2018-2021 Business Plan, the rationalisation of the distribution network, the search for 
innovation, the digitalisation and the offer of integrated models come to fruition in the remote consulting of the 
Online Branch.
In 2019, the Remote Manager Project was progressively extended to all Regional Governance Centres with 
a total of 14 Remote Branches with 141 Remote Managers in operation. The Remote Manager manages the 
relationship, the management and development of the customers included in the portfolio, starting from an 
initial phase of creation thereof where customers are called to propose the new service, with voluntary and free 
participation and then move on to the management and advice, always remotely. The Remote Manager is not 
an exclusive point of contact for the customer, who can always opt to make an appointment with the Network, 
according to the need to be satisfied. This is a relevant innovative feature: a circular model that puts customers 
at the centre, with two relationships that accompany them in their choices and support them in their decisions.
The geographical coverage and accessibility of services are offered by Banca 5, the first online Bank in Italy to 
operate in the payment system sector and based exclusively on a network of tobacco points of sale. Banca 5 
has about 17,000 businesses with terminals for the provision of proximity financial services (withdrawals and 
transfers) and payment services (bill payment slips and Group cards). In 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo and Sisal, through 
Banca 5 and SisalPay, set up a NewCo that offers banking products, payment and transactional services at over 
50,000 merchants located throughout the entire country, which are visited by 45 million individuals daily. The new 
network, fully operational from the beginning of 2020, will add to the offering of products and services of Banca 
5 and SisalPay.
In 2019, the International Subsidiary Banks Division continued its projects:
 Adopting Group Distribution Model, implementing the new commercial service model in Banca Intesa Beograd 
in Serbia, CIB Bank in Hungary, Privredna Banka Zagreb-PBZ in Croatia, VÚB Banka in Slovakia and 
Intesa Sanpaolo Bank in Slovenia, involving about 300 branches for the benefit of 300,000 customers with a 
personalised consulting service from the dedicated manager and a service that is constantly improving, also 
thanks to additional latest generation ATMs (255 advanced ATMs). Given the positive results achieved, the 
Division decided to include Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania, Intesa Sanpaolo Banka Bosna i Hercegovina and 
Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Romania in the project.
 DigiCal programme strengthened the integration between the physical and the digital channels in order to 
digitalise current processes for Retail and Small Business customers. During 2019, the number of online 
customers using digital channels grew steadily: 278,000 in CIB Bank in Hungary, 257,000 in Bank of Alexandria, 
483,000 in Privredna Banka Zagreb - PBZ in Croatia and 35,000 in Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania. At the end 
of the year DigiCal was extended to Intesa Sanpaolo Bank in Slovenia with internet and mobile banking. In 
2019, Privredna Banka Zagreb - PBZ in Croatia reached over 5,000 customers with the introduction of the 
Digi4Biz Internet and Mobile Banking platform dedicated to the Small Business and SME segment, which will 
be extended in 2020 to CIB Bank in Hungary and Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania.
