INDUSTRIAL DIALOGUE AND THE PRODUCTION CHAINS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Dialogo Industriale ("Industrial Dialogue") was born with the aim of increasing the "strength of the relationship" 
of managers with companies, identifying a common language for a better understanding of their needs, oriented 
to offer solutions better suited to the objectives and peculiarities of each company. It combines company 
requirements and credit quality, supporting the creation of sustainable business.
In 2019, functions were developed and implemented in order to extend the use of the platform to potential 
new customers, to enhance the information assets linked to the industrial supply chains and to encourage 
commercial-credit collaboration.
The Sviluppo Filiere (“Supply Chain Development”) programme continued concurrently with Dialogo Industriale, 
with the aim of facilitating access to credit, focusing on the relationship that links lead companies with the 
suppliers’ network and enabling a more detailed understanding of the financial requirements of individual 
supply chains. At the end of 2019, there were around 680 participating lead companies with potentially 15,600 
suppliers and a workforce of 93,000 employees.
