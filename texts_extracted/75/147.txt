Taking into account the results of the monitoring process, Intesa Sanpaolo pledges to:
 assess whether the policy needs updating;
 define guidelines for actions aiming to prevent and mitigate possible negative impacts on its stakeholders;
 issue, if necessary, further documents on specific rights and activities.
As a further guarantee for all stakeholders, anyone that wishes to report an incident of non-compliance can write to 
the Code of Ethics email address (codice.etico@intesasanpaolo.com), anonymously and without fear of reprisals. As 
regards reports of alleged human rights violations received in 2019, see page 40.
Human rights issues have, once again this year, been subject to third-party verification in accordance with the 
principles and contents of the ISO 26000 standard. The third-party assessment conducted in 2019 confirmed 
a positive evaluation determined by the presence of regulations, procedures and good practices aimed at 
protecting the human rights listed in the relevant policy, in relation to the main categories of stakeholders. 
The 2019 assessment, despite highlighting an increase compared to 2018, revealed aspects of improvement 
as regards stakeholders, suppliers and the community. With regard to the former, the need to extend the 
application of the Supplier Portal and strengthen the monitoring measures on all service providers that involve 
the presence of personnel at Intesa Sanpaolo offices was reported. For the community the need emerged 
to refine the tools required to investigate and assess respect for the rights of the community by the financed 
parties. 
Human rights aspects were checked across all areas, with regard to the following issues:
