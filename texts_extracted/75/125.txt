UNI ISO 45001:2018 CERTIFICATION FOR OHSMS
The procedure of certifying the Occupational Health and Safety Management System in accordance 
with the UNI ISO 45001:2018 standard (as opposed to the British Standard OHSAS 18001:2007 as was 
previously the case) was concluded in 2019, two years ahead of the deadline. The new standard, which 
adopts the same structure (High Level Structure - HLS) as other ISO management system standards, 
is designed to be integrated in existing management processes. As such, the audit carried out by a 
third party focused on the integration of processes according to the three international certification 
standards ISO 45001:2018 – Health and Safety, ISO 14001:2015 – Environment and ISO 50001:2011 – 
Energy. The audit activities were based on a significant sample of branches and sites and involved the 
main head office departments, branch employees, qualified physicians, Worker Safety Representatives, 
and maintenance and cleaning company staff. The certification obtained covers 100% of the Intesa 
Sanpaolo branches and buildings in Italy.
WORKER SAFETY REPRESENTATIVES
Following a 2016 union agreement the Group’s Worker Safety Representatives (WSR) were elected. 
Their areas of responsibility are defined on a geographical basis. The group of representatives 
currently numbers 111 employees who represent almost 100% of the staff. Every year dedicated 
training activities are held to update the WSR. Thanks to this series of activities it was possible to 
make the procedures for consultation and participation in the overall health and safety management 
system fully operative, as established by the regulations.
