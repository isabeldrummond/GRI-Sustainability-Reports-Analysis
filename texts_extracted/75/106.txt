Responsibility towards the supply chain
COMPANY POLICIES 
In order to ensure that relations with suppliers and purchasing policies can create conditions that promote 
sustainable economic development and respect for human rights, in 2019 Intesa Sanpaolo completed 
Phase 2 of the Razionalizzazione Acquisti (Purchasing Rationalisation) project. This programme led 
to the centralisation in the Parent Company of sourcing, regulatory monitoring, supplier qualification 
and monitoring and adaptation of the contractual standards of some Group companies like Banca 5 
and of all purchases of other Group companies belonging to the Private Banking, Asset Management 
and Insurance Divisions. The project carried out by the Procurement Head Office Department has 
aligned the acquisition process and purchasing logic with the principles of listening, transparency, 
equal opportunities and fairness espoused by the Code of Ethics and the social and environmental 
responsibility criteria promoted by the Group, the new process guidelines for procurement management 
were published, standardising the purchasing process and describing the roles and responsibilities of 
all company departments involved. 
MANAGING THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
In accordance with the company’s strategies and goals, the Procurement Head Office Department promotes 
policies and shared best practices in the area of procurement for the entire Intesa Sanpaolo Group to safeguard 
the principles of ethical, social and environmental responsibility shared by the Group.
The Procurement Head Office Department, in charge of procurement in the area defined by the relevant 
guidelines and rules, oversees the purchasing process, guaranteeing the regularity and consistency of 
purchases by observing the relevant policies and internal regulations, also via an e-sourcing application 
called Supplier Gate, for the integrated management of the purchasing process, with a view to increasingly 
ethical negotiations and the competitive comparison of the technical and economic characteristics of the 
offers submitted by suppliers and sub-suppliers, which was implemented during 2019 by the direct negotiation 
management module.
The new e-sourcing module has made it possible to match Calls for Tenders, already managed on the Supplier 
Portal, with the events acquired in relation to Direct Negotiations, strengthening the qualification process, the 
verification of suppliers/sub-suppliers and third parties and their control/monitoring over time. In order to ensure 
greater transparency, regularity and fairness in the verification, control and monitoring of all counterparties of 
the Intesa Sanpaolo Group with respect to Purchasing, the automation of the process of qualifying Suppliers 
and Third Parties registered on the Supplier Portal was completed in 2019. The computerisation of the 
qualification process has also made it possible to continuously monitor all the positions in question accurately 
and punctually, also with the aim of contributing to the strengthening and efficiency of control and due diligence.
In 2019 the Contract Management Module of the Supplier Portal was aligned with the requirements imposed 
by the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing and by the SRB Authority for the resolution of critical contracts in 
order to allow Regulators to accurately verify the content of the agreements/contracts entered in the Module. 
Suppliers view the Intesa Sanpaolo Code of Ethics when registering with the Supplier Gate and, if they sign a 
supply or service agreement, pledge to respect the main relevant contents of the Code when performing their 
assigned tasks, including on behalf of their representatives, employees, workers and subcontractors. They 
must also read the Organisational, Management and Control Model (Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001) and 
the Group’s Internal Code of Conduct.
The supplier selection process takes place during registration on Supplier Gate by means of an assessment 
that not only takes account of the organisational-technical and economic/financial characteristics of each 
supplier, but also includes analyses of their business ethics, respect for human rights, workers’ rights and the 
environment. If the outcome of this assessment is positive, suppliers are registered in the Group Suppliers’ 
Register and can be invited to procurement events. 5,569 suppliers had completed the Supplier Gate registration 
procedure as of the end of 2019.
QUESTIONNAIRE, REPORTING, CONTROLS 
With regard to the checks carried out on suppliers and third parties, when registering with Supplier Gate the 
counterparty fills in a compulsory questionnaire on social and environmental responsibility issues providing 
supporting documentation. This must be updated at least once a year. This procedure makes it possible to 
exclude suppliers and third parties that do not satisfy the minimum requirements of the system a priori, and to
