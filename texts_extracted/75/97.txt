Meals
The four-year partnership (2018-2021) with Fondazione Banco Alimentare Onlus allows for a long-term 
consolidation of the process of recovery and redistribution of letfover food and contributed to the distribution 
of over 2,100,000 meals to charitable organisations in 2019.
Last year the partnership was further strengthened by the joint development of two projects: Siticibo, 
which has made it possible to offer indigent people more than 1,500,000 meals from the surplus cooked 
and fresh food from foodservice organisations, and RE-FISHED: from illegal trade to charity, an initiative 
for the distribution of fish seized from illegal fishing in Sicily that has contributed portions of fish for about 
55,000 meals for people in difficulty.
New partnerships have also been established with: Diakonia Association to guarantee 39,000 meals a 
year to the vulnerable people assisted; La Compagnia degli amici di Gesù, Giuseppe e Maria Association 
to offer 5,000 meals a year; City Angels Milan to guarantee 15,000 meals to homeless people.
The NOI INSIEME - Natale 2019 (Us together - Christmas 2019) project was also launched. During 
the Christmas period, the Bank opened its doors to around 2,000 destitute people assisted by Caritas, 
welcoming them for lunch and offering them cultural entertainment in ten cities: Turin, Milan, Vicenza, 
Padua, Genoa, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Naples and Lecce. As proof that Intesa Sanpaolo's social 
commitment starts first and foremost with its own people, many employees took part in the initiative as 
volunteers to welcome guests and eat lunch with them.
With regard to support for basic needs, the actions dedicated to meals for sick people and their families 
are particularly important:
 The partnership with Dynamo Camp guarantees about 252,000 free meals per year to sick children, 
guests of the Association who participate in recreational therapy;
 The partnership with Associazione Italiana Contro le Leucemie - Linfomi e Mieloma - AIL Milano (Italian 
Association against Leukemia-Lymphoma and Myeloma – AIL Milan) covers almost 67,000 meals a 
year for those who are required to travel considerable distances for healthcare treatment, hosted in the 
Association's homes;
 The partnership with the Together To Go - TOG Foundation ensures the serving of about 16,000 meals per 
year as part of the rehabilitation therapy of young patients suffering from serious neurological diseases;
 The new project carried out with Vidas guarantees almost 15,000 meals a year to children and their 
families in the 6 mini-apartments of the Casa Sollievo Bimbi in Milan, a paediatric hospice inaugurated 
in April also thanks to the Bank's contribution;
 The partnership with Fondazione Santobono Pausilipon provides about 17,500 meals a year to the 
parents of children undergoing long-term care in the Family Room and Alma Mater at Pausilipon Hospital.
Hospitality 
Hospitality projects relate to two areas: pathologies and people forced to travel significant distances for 
healthcare reasons; fragility and marginalisation.
The initiatives go beyond providing beds: beneficiaries of the actions are accommodated in welcoming 
environments similar to homes, thus reducing the effects of hospitalisation and poverty.
The project Una casa per la mia famiglia (A home for my family) offers free accommodations to the 
families of children undergoing treatment in the partner hospitals of the Intesa Sanpaolo Programme for 
children receiving long-term medical care with Fondazione Gerolamo Gaslini in Genoa (139,000 beds), 
Comitato Maria Letizia Verga in Monza (25,000 beds), Fondazione Santobono Pausilipon in Naples 
(13,500 beds).
The project launched with AIL plans to offer practical assistance to people forced to travel significant 
distances for healthcare reasons who, living far from Haematology Centres, require accommodation 
and services. The aim is to provide over 19,000 beds a year.
The partnership with Dynamo Camp guarantees about 84,000 free beds per year to sick children, guests 
of the Association who participate in recreational therapy, and the project carried out with Vidas provides 
almost 2,500 beds for children and their families in the mini-apartments of the Casa Sollievo Bimbi 
Children’s Hospice in Milan. The Bank has promoted synergies between Dynamo Camp and VIDAS for 
the implementation of joint initiatives that complement the children's care and assistance.
Concurrently, the shelter project launched in Milan with City Angels combats the severe marginalisation 
of homeless people: not only does it offer them practical assistance by providing about 47,000 beds 
a year, it also enables social and job market reintegration processes to help people get back on their 
feet and regain their social and economic independence. New partnerships have also been established 
with: Diakonia Association to guarantee 78,500 beds a year to the vulnerable people assisted, and La 
Compagnia degli amici di Gesù, Giuseppe e Maria Association to offer 4,500 beds per year.
