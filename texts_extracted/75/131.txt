In line with the Rules of environmental sustainability for the development of sustainable branches, the site 
renovations or the development of new branches are carried out in accordance with criteria for the improvement 
of energy and management efficiency: since 2008, over 1,000 Group buildings have undergone energy 
certification processes. 
Thanks to the measures implemented in recent years, in Italy the Group was able to claim tax deductions of 
around 7.7 million euro in 2014-2019, around 700,000 euro in 2019.
It should also be noted that, as evidence of sustainable building management, the Intesa Sanpaolo Skyscraper 
in Turin, in addition to having received the LEED Platinum certification in 2015 for the construction of the 
building, was awarded the Platinum level in 2019 also in the sustainable building management category. In the 
former case, the Green Building Council, the most authoritative international body for the eco-assessment of 
buildings, had rewarded the design features and technological solutions adopted during the construction of the 
skyscraper. This new certification (LEED Existing Buildings Operations & Maintenance - EB O&M) confirms, on 
the other hand, the performance achieved in the building management, in particular for those areas envisaged 
by the international reference standard. The energy efficiency actions, the sustainable consumption of water, 
the management of materials and resources, employee commuting habits and the indoor environmental 
conditions, allowed to reach a score well above the threshold needed to access the most prestigious level.
All the actions implemented above confirm the Group's commitment to reducing its environmental footprint 
whilst still respecting people's safety and comfort standards and sound property management practices. To this 
end, it is important to point out that an analysis of the potential risks related to climate change is also applied, 
aimed both at preventing possible service interruptions and avoiding extraordinary property management 
costs (see page 46).
RENEWABLE ENERGY
In addition to the energy efficiency measures aimed at reducing its environmental impact, the Intesa Sanpaolo 
Group has committed, where possible, to producing electricity through the installation of photovoltaic plants 
and purchasing electricity from renewable sources. The total consumption of electricity from renewable sources 
reached approximately 83% of the total consumption.
The self-production of energy from renewable sources comes from the photovoltaic plants in Italy, 9 of which 
with a capacity under 20 kWp and 5 of large size, and from two plants in Slovenia. In 2019 the self-production 
amounted to over 1,119 MWh with an economic saving generated by the non-purchase of electricity equal to 
approximately 195,000 euro, and a total of CO  avoided equal to 535 tonnes.
