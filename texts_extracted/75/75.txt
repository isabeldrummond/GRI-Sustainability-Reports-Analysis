Access to credit and financial inclusion
COMPANY POLICIES
Intesa Sanpaolo provides a range of products and services that promote financial inclusion and access 
to credit, in accordance with the Group's Code of Ethics. This code highlights, among the principles of 
customer relations, this policy’s value as a key lever for social inclusion, enabling people to improve their 
lives and exercise their citizenship rights to the full. The Code of Ethics also outlines Intesa Sanpaolo’s 
commitment to promoting economic and social development in the countries where it operates. In 
particular, this responsibility results in assisting companies to develop and improve their competitiveness, 
and to introduce innovations and internationalise their business. Among other initiatives, the 2018-2021 
Business Plan launched the Fund for Impact, which is intended to disburse social impact loans of 
around 1.25 billion euro to sections of society that find it difficult to access credit, despite their potential.
FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE
Support of people in vulnerable conditions is offered through projects and initiatives aimed at the fair allocation 
of resources by identifying actors within the territory with whom agreements and synergies can be developed 
that will make access to credit easier for vulnerable individuals or those who would otherwise have no access 
to banking.
INITIATIVES WITH HIGH SOCIAL IMPACT 
In 2019, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group issued new loans for high social impact activities amounting to 
about 3.8 billion euro, equal to 6.6% of the total granted, helping to create business and employment 
opportunities and also to assist people in difficulty with various initiatives: microfinance; anti-usury loans; 
products and services for associations and entities in the Third Sector; products for the most vulnerable 
social groups to support their financial inclusion; and loans to support people affected by disasters.
