EX FS1 Society
The assets of the funds of the asset management company that meet sustainability criteria (ESG) amounted to 
about 6.6 billion euro (about 2% of the total and around 9.6% of the assets of Italian funds). The range of products 
and services is completed with the management of four ethical funds, characterised by the a priori exclusion from 
the investable universe of all companies involved in activities considered unethical, such as nuclear energy, arms 
and tobacco. All the products belonging to the “Ethics System” envisage the donation of proceeds. The amount of 
assets under management in the area of Ethical Funds amounted to over 1.6 billion euro in 2019 (2.3% of the total 
amount managed in Italian funds). All in all, the assets under management in funds meeting sustainable and ethical 
criteria (37 products at the end of 2019) amounted to over 8.2 billion euro (over 2.4% of the total and around 12% of 
Italian funds). In general, the performances of both ethical funds and funds managed with ESG criteria were positive 
due to the market’s own performance, with the results largely in line with the market or the reference benchmark.
In addition, Eurizon manages 15 mandates relating to 13 customers characterised by sustainability criteria, making 
for about 3.5 billion euro. In particular, the services provided for these mandates concern the choice of ad hoc 
benchmarks, supporting engagement and corporate governance activities, and the creation of exclusion lists when 
selecting investments.
During 2019, Eurizon continued its commitment to spreading the culture of sustainability by participating in numerous 
conferences, like the Salone SRI, the Italian Corporate Governance Conference, the Conference on Green 
and Social Bonds organised by Icma/Assiom. Eurizon also held sustainability induction sessions organised by 
Assogestioni in favour of both current officers and candidates for corporate bodies. At the invitation of Assogestioni, 
an induction session was also held for the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors of an issuer listed 
on the Milan Stock Exchange. It has continuously participated in working groups organised by institutions like 
Consob, European Banking Federation, Assogestioni and Foundations.
FIDEURAM – INTESA SANPAOLO PRIVATE BANKING
The Private Banking Division specialises in offering advisory services to meet the financial, pension and 
insurance needs of Private customers and HNWIs (High Net Worth Individuals). As well as listening to and 
entering into a dialogue with customers for the continuous improvement of its service quality, it is also committed 
to spreading an appropriate financial culture in order to improve the customers’ knowledge and awareness with 
regard to investment choices, including in relation to issues of social and environmental interest.
The progressive integration of ESG criteria is taking place across the product range (under administration, own 
and third party funds, personalized management mandates, internal insurance funds private insurance) with 
the aim of offering a full spectrum of opportunities.
In particular, with regard to Fideuram Multibrand, the offer of traditional investment funds with ethical and 
social value has been enriched with the inclusion of third party funds that have consolidated and recognised 
experience in this field, improving the coverage of different types of investment (equity, bond, flexible) and 
allowing customers greater freedom in the composition of their portfolio in accordance with ESG principles.
Among its own funds Fideuram Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking offers two different products, Fonditalia 
Ethical Investment and Fonditalia Millenials Equity, for total assets of approximately 225 million euro. 
The first, initially proposed as a flexible bond, expanded its mandate to include the equity segment and the use 
of third-party funds. It has a decision-making process which combines ESG criteria with the goal of producing 
clear and measurable positive impacts for people and the environment at an individual investment level. The 
task of ensuring consistency between the actual composition of the portfolio and the ethical principles it is 
based on is entrusted to an Ethics Committee consisting of managers and experts from different academic 
and professional areas.
Fonditalia Millennials Equity in contrast invests in equity instruments, mainly issued by companies with a 
clearly defined business model, to fully capture the consumer habits of the Millennials (particularly conscious 
of ESG topics). It combines financial and sustainability analysis in accordance with the following criteria:
 companies that do not respect the principles of the UN Global Compact and whose revenues partially derive 
from activities deemed harmful to people and the environment (e.g. fossil fuels, arms, pornography) are 
excluded (negative screening);
 ESG assessment of securities in the portfolio, in order to assign a sustainability rating based on the quantitative 
analysis of data from external sources and a qualitative audit by expert analysts. The rating ranges from 0 to 
5, with 3 being the minimum threshold for the initial inclusion of the security in the portfolio;
 creation of a system to measure the maximum weighting in the growing portfolio, according to the sustainability 
rating of the companies in which the investment is made;
 continuous controls of risk situations (disputes or relevant issues in the area of ESG) in order to enable the 
management team to carry out constant monitoring which, in particularly significant cases, can result in a 
red flag and a subsequent assessment of the merits of disposing of the investment in the company involved;
 establishment of a minimum sustainability rating goal for the portfolio (for the portion covered by the rating).
