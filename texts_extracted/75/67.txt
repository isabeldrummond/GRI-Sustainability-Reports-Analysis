Excluding claims submitted by former Accedo customers who, in exchange for the early redemption of loans 
with assignment of one-fifth of salary, claim the pro-rata refund of fees and/or charges paid at the time of 
disbursement, the following are the complaints and reiterations submitted for the various product/service 
macro-categories:
 Organisational issues and the management/functionality of websites: 12,025 complaints and reiterations

of requests for the disclaimers of transactions made with payment cards or through internet banking services,

of disputes relating to alleged usury, the alleged usurious nature of the conditions and the illegitimacy of the 
compound effects of interest capitalisation, the way in which the APR is calculated or its alleged divergence 
from the agreed rate and errors and/or delays in the execution of transactions;
 current accounts, deposits and securities: 3,703 complaints and reiterations, with a decrease of 27%, mainly

part of the Bank;

in processing requests for copies of documentation made by customers of the former Banche Venete with

for reimbursement of damages caused by the investment in securities issued by the banks themselves, for 
which the Bank has already taken the appropriate steps;
 insurance products: 1,973 complaints and reiterations, with an increase of 38%, mainly relating to policies 
linked to loans, class I life insurance policies and class III policies, the main reason being the correctness of
