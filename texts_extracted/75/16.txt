CALCULATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ECONOMIC VALUE 
The economic value generated by the Group in the year is calculated in accordance with ABI (“Italian Banking 
Association”) instructions and consistent with international reference standards. The calculation is made by 
reclassifying consolidated income statement items recorded in the financial statements, as required under 
Bank of Italy Circular 262. 
The economic value generated, which in 2019 was over 17 billion euro, came from net income from banking 
and insurance activities – which therefore takes into account the impairment losses on loans and other financial 
assets – plus the realised gains and losses on investments in associates and companies subject to joint 
control, investments and other operating income. The amount of the economic value generated expresses the 
value of the wealth produced, most of which distributed among the stakeholders with which the Group interacts 
in various ways on a day-to-day basis. In particular:
•  employees and other staff benefited from over 37% of the economic value generated, for a total of 6.5 
billion euro. In addition to staff pay, the total also includes payments to the network of financial advisors;
•  suppliers received 14% of the economic value generated, for a total of 2.4 billion euro in payment for goods 
and services;
•  the Government, Organisations and Institutions recorded a total flow of funds of 3.2 billion euro, around 
18% of the economic value generated, almost 900 million euro of which referring to indirect taxes and 
duties, over 1.7 billion euro to taxes on income from continuing operations, and over 500 million to levies 
and other charges concerning the banking industry, consisting of contributions to resolution and guarantee 
funds. There were also numerous social and cultural initiatives and other actions taken to support the 
charity funds and issue disbursements by way of social and cultural contributions;
•  approximately 21% of the economic value generated was allocated to Shareholders, holders of equity 
instruments and minority interests, largely in terms of the proposed dividend, for a total of approximately 
3.6 billion euro.
The remaining amount, around 1.7 billion euro, was withheld by the corporate system and mainly comprises 
deferred tax assets and liabilities, amortisation and depreciation, provisions for risks and charges, and retained 
earnings. Self-financing is to be considered an investment that other stakeholder categories make each year 
to maintain efficiency and allow the sustainable development of the Bank as a whole.
