COMPANY CARPOOLING
In a context where pollution figures, especially in large cities, are becoming increasingly worrying, the 
search for sustainable mobility solutions becomes a priority. Company carpooling is one of the concrete 
solutions that the Bank puts in place to this effect, namely a mode of transport based on several people 
with compatible routes and times sharing the same private car. The aim is to share the car for commutes 
in order to improve the quality of transfers, make savings on transport expenses, reduce traffic congestion, 
pollution and road accidents. The dedicated App allows supply to meet demand as regards travel, the 
sharing of the related expenses, the possible allocation of parking spaces, where available, and to create 
a network between users. The service, which initially started as a pilot project, has been available to all 
employees in Italy since October 2019.
Other forms of car sharing have been implemented in Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania, CIB Bank (Hungary), 
Banca Intesa Beograd (Serbia), Pravex Bank (Ukraine), Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Romania and, starting from 
2019, also in Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Slovenia, Intesa Sanpaolo Banka Bosna i Hercegovina, Privredna 
Banka Zagreb (Croatia) and in VÚB Banka (Slovakia). 
RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES 
According to the Code of Ethics and the Rules for the environmental and energy policy, the Group’s respon-
sibilities include the close evaluation of the consequences of its activities on ecosystems and the reduction of 
its environmental footprint. For this reason, the responsible management of resources is a priority issue for the 
Intesa Sanpaolo Group in its attempts to mitigate its impact on the environment.  
PAPER, TONERS AND STATIONERY
In line with the provisions laid down in the Group Rules, the reduction in the use of paper continued both in 
absolute terms (-9.3% compared to 2018) and on a staff member basis (-8.6% compared to 2018). 
In Italy, the project for paperless contracts continued: in addition to bank contracts, investment transactions and 
branch transactions, in 2019, it was extended to banking products and services related to pension plans and 
after-sales operations on POS contracts. The introduction of paperless POS contract was also accompanied 
by the start of the extension of dematerialised operations to contracts for legal entities. With the adoption and 
exclusive use of the graphometric or remote digital signature for the signing of contractual and non-contractual 
documentation, instead of paper documents, in all branches, the Bank offers its customers a simple and 
innovative customer experience that also allows to simplify and improve managers' operations through a 
considerable simplification of internal paper management and archiving processes and the creation of a digital 
document archive that facilitates the storage and retrieval of documents and ensures better filing, according to 
legislation in force, eliminating back office activities. 
As part of the three-year programme for the digitisation of all the Group's HR systems and services, the process 
of dematerialisation of the letters addressed to employees (communications of merit, awards, assignments, 
transfers, etc.) was also started, alongside the launch, in some workstations, of the project aimed at reviewing 
print management processes, which involves, first and foremost, the rationalisation of the printers. In addition, 
in order to better protect the confidentiality and security of information, avoiding abandoned print jobs, the 
printing of documents through authentication was introduced.
The policies for the use of printers were reviewed in the Eurizon group, the documentation of the Boards of 
Directors was converted into electronic format and important investments were made to convert customer 
reporting into digital format. The reduced printing of the documentation in support of meetings is also promoted 
and a project was launched to automate the main approval workflows, with the introduction of paperless 
processes based on digital signature.                                                                          
Further initiatives related to the graphometric signature were also launched in Siref and in Fideuram Asset 
Management. 
The digital transformation process also continues in the branches of the International Subsidiary Banks Division
