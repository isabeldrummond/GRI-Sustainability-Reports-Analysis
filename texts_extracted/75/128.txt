* Emission factors for the calculation of C2 established by Intesa Sanpaolo, in accordance with the ABI Energia Guidelines - Linee guida sull'applicazione in Banca del GRI Standard 
O
in materia ambientale - and on the basis of the main 2019 publications (UNFCCC, IEA, IPCC, AIB, etc.).
** Market-based: for purchased electricity the Scope2 data considers the contribution, agreed contractually, of the guaranteed renewable source certificates, which therefore have 
zero emissions.
