COMPANY POLICIES 
Through the Group policy, Human Rights Principles, Intesa Sanpaolo pledges to:
 support the protection of human rights in accordance with the principles established in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and subsequent international conventions on civil and political 
rights and economic, social and cultural rights;
 recognise the principles established by the fundamental conventions of the ILO (International Labour 
Organization) and in particular the right of association and the right to collective bargaining, the 
abolition of forced and child labour, and non-discrimination in employment;
 contribute to combating corruption, supporting the guidelines of the OECD (Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development) and the anti-corruption principles established by the UN in 2003, and 
also by taking a 'zero tolerance' approach to any eventual cases of corruption.
THE PROCESS OF MONITORING HUMAN RIGHTS
The implementation and gradual extension of the protection of human rights is monitored by Corporate Social 
Responsibility through:
 monitoring  the  implementation  and  governance  of  the  Group’s  Code  of  Ethics,  also  with  third-party 
assessments in line with the international UNI ISO 26000 standard, with a specific focus on the areas related 
to human rights;
 the sustainability report, which involves stakeholders and defines improvement objectives and the relative 
metrics and is subject to the certification of an independent auditor outside the Group;
 the analysis of potential risk areas in the sphere of human rights which, for every principle in the international 
conventions, outlines the possible impacts of the company’s operations on its stakeholders and the relative 
company regulations.
