took part in three meetings with the Risks Committee (with the Management Control Committee also invited to 
two of them) to provide information on the 2018 Consolidated Non-financial Statement, on the Consolidated Non-
financial Statement as at 30 June 2019, drawn up on a voluntary basis for the first time this year and published in 
September and on Intesa Sanpaolo's positioning in the main sustainability/ESG indices and rankings. 
In addition, it presented the Annual Report on the implementation and governance of the Code of Ethics to 
the Management Control Committee together with the Surveillance Body pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 
231/2001. 
In these activities, CSR is supported by a network of about 60 CSR Contacts appointed in the main structures and 
by the CSR Delegates identified in each of the Banks that are part of the International Subsidiary Banks Division. 
Also in 2019, in order to strengthen sustainability governance, CSR involved those reporting directly to the CEO 
in specifically organised meetings with the aim of further increasing engagement and knowledge of ESG issues. 
For each Governance Area, Division and Head Office Department, each Chief identified Sustainability Managers 
capable of playing a strategic role in the definition and implementation of sustainability objectives and in the 
cooperation and coordination between Top Management and CSR.
In 2019, CSR promoted specific initiatives including:
 the adoption of the UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking - PRB, a planning document that intends 
to bring the banking sector closer to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Climate 
Agreement;
 responding to 23 assessments from investors and analysts on ESG and climate change issues, and holding 
33 meetings with 47 parties including investors and analysts focusing on sustainability, in collaboration with 
Investor Relations and Investor Coverage.
Moreover, in order to consolidate the Group's leadership in sustainability the ISP4ESG project was launched, a 
wide-ranging initiative with a significant impact promoted by the Financial Market Coverage Department of the 
Chief Financial Officer Governance Area in coordination with the Strategic Support Department, which involved 
the various Group structures. Starting with the mapping of the ESG positioning with respect to the main players 
in the sector, strengths and areas for specific focus were highlighted, also in light of recent regulatory scenarios, 
with the aim of being an exemplary model in the sustainability/ESG strategy. 
IMPLEMENTATION AND GOVERNANCE OF THE CODE OF ETHICS
The Code of Ethics is the self-regulation document for the integration of social and environmental considerations into 
company processes, practices and decisions. It contains voluntary commitments in the management of relations with 
all the Group's internal and external stakeholders, setting out the core values and foundations of the corporate culture. 
The Code's implementation and governance mechanism is based on the following cornerstones:
 The principle of self-responsibility, where each structure is directly responsible and ensures adherence to the values 
and principles of the Code, setting the related objectives and action plans and, where appropriate, appointing a CSR 
Contact and Sustainability Managers.
 The commitments set out in the Code are given practical expression in the annual reporting process (Consolidated 
Non-financial Statement), which presents the management policies and procedures, initiatives, indicators and 
objectives for the issues relevant to the stakeholders and the business. Furthermore, in 2019 the process was also 
reinforced by the half-yearly non-financial reporting.
 The analysis and subsequent certification of corporate social responsibility governance by an independent third 
party in accordance with the principles and contents of standard ISO 26000, published annually on the website [i]. 
The Governance was assessed according to the method UNI PdR (“Reference Practice”) 18:2016, which concluded 
with a rating of “Consistent and committed to excellence” and a score of 44 on a scale from 15 to 45 (in 2018 the score 
was 42). The update of the third-party assessment relating to the application of the Code of Ethics was carried out by 
focusing on the analysis of the Governance of relevant issues that emerged from the annual materiality analysis. The 
assessment revealed that the Group's CSR governance has matured substantially, with clear assignment of ESG 
responsibilities to the Steering Committee. The scoring for Italy shows an increase in relation to 7 out of 10 issues. 
It should be noted that the Direct Environmental Impacts had already achieved the maximum score. The monitoring 
of cross-cutting processes (human resources management, health and safety, management of direct impacts on 
the environment, prevention of corruption, Community commitment) was found to be robust and effective for Italy, 
distinguished by further innovative ideas. The introduction of ESG logic in the granting of credit, asset management 
and management of insurance products emerged with greater clarity, particularly with respect to Italy. In relation to 
International Subsidiary Banks, in line with the strengthening of CSR Governance activities, an improvement in 9 of 
the 10 topics analysed is appreciated. In particular, the most significant improvements were recorded in the issues 
Integrity in corporate conduct, Quality and innovation in customer relations, Responsible asset management and 
Employee growth and development. 
 Management of cases of non-compliance with the Code of Ethics: CSR receives reports sent in and, following the 
necessary checks, replies in collaboration with the structures concerned, ensuring to protect the reporting parties 
from any form of retaliation, discrimination or penalisation, and guaranteeing the utmost confidentiality, without
