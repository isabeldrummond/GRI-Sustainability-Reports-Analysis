SOLUTIONS FOR YOUNG CUSTOMERS 
Solutions for young customers include: 
 mortgages, in particular Mutuo Giovani, with a total disbursement – also considering the Guarantee Fund for 
Main Home Purchases – of about 2.5 billion euro to over 21,700 young people;
 loans, with the product dedicated to young university students "per Merito" with the aim of facilitating access 
to studies, the details of which are outlined in the section "Fund for Impact - New credit access opportunities";
 current accounts, with the XME Conto product, with preferential conditions and tax paid by the Bank, up to 
35 years of age, with just under 898,000 holders at the end of 2019 and with XME Conto UP! for those under 
18, completely free until the age of 18;
 savings with XME Salvadanaio, the digital piggy bank that can be used by children and adults alike, which 
allows them to set retained sums of money, either manually or automatically for rounding off payment trans-
actions made by card. The "children’s version" of XME Salvadanaio is called XME dindi, a technological 
piggy bank that, in addition to collecting coins and banknotes, makes it possible to see the money saved in 
XME Salvadanaio, the progress in achieving the set objectives and to monitor the balance of XME Conto UP! 
through the touch screen on the device. In 2019, the product was proposed on World Savings Day in order 
to spread a financial culture and attention to savings from a very young age.
REMITTANCE MANAGEMENT
Intesa Sanpaolo offers specific products for foreign customers in Italy who need to send money to their home 
countries. In 2019, around 95,000 remittances were made, amounting to approximately 47 million euro.
PROJECT FOR THE FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF IMMIGRANTS 
The financial inclusion project for immigrants was developed on the basis of the results of a study 
on the current process and the future impact of immigrant integration dynamics on the sustainable 
growth of the country. The analysis resulted in internal Intesa Sanpaolo Group projects focused on 
training and change management, business development and change management.
SUPPORTING THE THIRD SECTOR
For some time now Intesa Sanpaolo has made available an offer dedicated to Third Sector organisations, 
first through Banca Prossima and then (after its merger in 2019 into Intesa Sanpaolo) through the Impact 
Department, into which it was incorporated.
At the end of 2019, there were about 66,000 customers, and direct and indirect deposits of about 5.8 billion 
euro, of which roughly 4.1 billion euro was in direct deposits, and about 2 billion euro in loans. The intangible 
assets of Third Sector entities play an important role in making their long-term financial exposure sustainable. 
To this end, specific rating models have been developed that better suit the characteristics of customers 
from the non-profit and religious sectors, particularly with respect to the qualitative section. As a guarantee 
of its activities, the articles of association of Banca Prossima envisage a Fund for the development of social 
enterprises, to which at least 50% of the remaining profits net of allocation to legal and statutory reserves and 
the reconstitution of the share premium reserve initially used to set up the Fund were allocated each year.
The Fund continued to function even after the incorporation of Banca Prossima, through the creation of a 
plafond of around 0.1% of the shareholders’ equity of Intesa Sanpaolo.
CROWDFUNDING PLATFORMS 
For Funding is the social crowdfunding platform of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group aimed at organisations, non-prof-
it associations and foundations which want to launch a fundraising campaign with the participation of a wider 
donor community. The fundraising initiatives are selected by the Intesa Sanpaolo team, which evaluates the 
beneficiary organisation and the type of projects in order to support the most deserving projects. Once the 
project has been published on the platform, donors may contribute to the fundraising process with a donation 
made through the website using a credit card, by online bank transfer, or with a bank transfer made at their 
own bank or at any Intesa Sanpaolo branch. Each transaction is free for both the donor and the beneficiary.
In 2019 For Funding became a unique, distinctive model in the world of social crowdfunding, incorporating the 
Terzo Valore platform developed by Banca Prossima for non-profit organisations. Supporters can underwrite 
part of the loan at a rate of their own choosing that is below a maximum level stated by the organisation itself. 
In fact, about half of lenders lend at zero interest. In 2019, 0.8 million euro were disbursed by the Bank and 0.9 
million euro by third parties.
