Occupational health and safety      [403-1:4]
UBI Group is not limited strictly to the formal observance of the regulatory texts. Instead, it 
aims  for  ongoing  improvement,  with  the  adoption  of  an  Occupational  Health  and  Safety 
Management System (SGSLS) drawing from the UNI-INAIL Guidelines and constituting the 
practical implementation of the guidelines provided under Model 231. The Health and Safety 
Management  System  (SGSL)  provides,  to  supplement  the  mandatory  regulatory  content, 
further  verification of  the  performance and efficacy  of corporate processes  in the correct 
implementation of the regulatory texts, coordinated by the designated SGLS Manager. This 
role is incumbent on the pro tempore manager of the parent company's Labour Prevention and 
Protection function.  
Health and safety policies, governed by Legislative Decree No. 81/2008 and addressed more 
specifically  under  the  Health  and  Safety  Management  System  Regulations  (SGSL),  are 
applicable to all companies in the Group operating in Italy. The Regulations were approved in 
October 2014 and the policies, based on the positive and negative aspects of the health 
monitoring activities conducted by competent physicians, are still considered to be valid. 
Responsibilities  in  this  connection  are  concentrated  with  the  UBI  Banca's  Occupational 
Prevention and Protection Function which operates directly on the staff of the Chief Operating 
Officer, who formally serves as the Employer's Health and Safety Officer. 
The implementing regulations for corporate policies in this connection break down the tasks 
and responsibilities of the various players and corporate units of the Group involved in the 
implementation of policies and processes for staff involvement; communication flows between 
the  various  units  and  mechanisms  to  integrate  the  SGSL  into  the  corporate  processes; 
mechanisms  for  planning,  monitoring,  and  periodic  re-examination  of  the  efficacy  of  the 
system provided in the UNI-INAIL Guidelines.
