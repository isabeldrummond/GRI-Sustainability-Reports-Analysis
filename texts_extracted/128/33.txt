to finance armed groups or conflicts) and “child labour free” (not deriving from mining and 
working processes using under-age labour). For the responsible sourcing of gold, UBI Banca 
has adopted the existing policy of Nuova Banca Etruria subject to the relevant amendments, 
for adoption group wide.9 In 2017 470 diamond trading transactions were brokered and 422 
transactions to purchase gold or to repay a loan in gold were carried out for which verification 
of compliance with the relative policy was also carried out. 
These transactions were close to zero as a percentage of the total number of transactions 
carried out by the Group. There were no other contracts or investments which are subject to 
or include clauses that are subject to human rights assessment.  
Depending on performance in connection with the Single Bank and the relevant transfer of 
skills for management of operations governed by the Group's arms policy, numerous training 
sessions on this topic – for a total of 381 hours - were held for 127 staff members responsible 
for international trade activities (0.6% of Group employees), which also focused on human 
rights issues. 
 
                                               
9 The Policy defines the internal guidelines for responsible sourcing of gold, with particular reference to  
the risk of violations in connection with human rights and financing of armed groups in the supply 
chain, drawing from the Model Supply Chain Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain of Minerals 
from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas” from “OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible 
Supply Chain”.  The policy is available to the public from the Social Responsibility section of the  
corporate website (www.ubibanca.it).
