UBI Welfare for Labour 
The broadest objective of UBI Banca is to build a "welfare ecosystem" that can meet new needs 
of enterprises, persons, and local communities with a true grassroots network, a well-being 
system with comprehensive coverage to supplement the State welfare system. A network that 
also creates interesting opportunities for organizations in the third sector such as corporate 
                                              
3 Pawn credit is one of the most ancient forms of lending practiced by the “Monti di Pietà” banks created 
in the 15th Century by the Franciscans to combat usury, still today the last real resort in access to 
credit. This business is carried out in nine branches in the towns and cities of Milan, Pavia, Bergamo, 
Varese, Monza, Como, Brescia, Crema and Rome; and from 23rd October 2017, in Fossombrone, 
Pesaro e Macerata, three branches for pawn activities deriving from the former Ex Nuova Banca 
Marche. During 2017, the average volume of lending was equal to approximately €33.2 million with 
approximately 28,112 policies; the average loan granted was approximately €1,180.
