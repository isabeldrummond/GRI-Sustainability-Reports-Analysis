 
welfare  service  and  benefit  providers  (improved  productivity,  competitiveness,  business 
climate,  and  ability  to  attract  and  keep  talent),  for  workers  and  their  families  (higher 
satisfaction levels, enhanced purchasing power and a better work-life balance). Against this 
backdrop, confirming proven practices, UBI Banca intends to propose "return welfare" by 
combining individual economic objectives with those of general interest through support for 
initiatives providing high levels of social benefits in which this new service receives a share of 
the returns. 
In partnership with DoubleYou Srl (a Zucchetti Group company), the first Italian software 
company in Europe, the UBI Welfare Service includes a computer platform and a package of 
services in connection with management of corporate welfare plans. These services provide an 
extremely simple approach to managing flexible benefits, alternative forms of compensation 
(tax-free  goods  and  services  and  management  of  performance  bonuses)  that  can  be 
personalised and adapted to any business size and requirements. At December 2017, 291 
corporate customers had joined the UBI Welfare Service, involving a total of 7,300 employees. 
Moreover, in this framework, liaison and development activities were undertaken with the key 
entrepreneurial  associations,  leading  to  the  signing  of  a  number  of  collaboration 
arrangements.  The  feedback  has  been  very  positive  in  terms  of  the  appreciation  of  and 
interest in the proposal. 
Similarly, Cassa Assistance Azienda Italia was established to provide assistance to non-profit 
organisations according to the principles of mutuality and solidarity. The Cassa provides 
direct disbursements and/or reimbursements for services, compensation, health benefits, 
assistance  and  social  benefits,  comprehensive  health  care,  supplementary  and/or 
replacement National Health Service benefits for registered persons and their beneficiaries, 
and through the execution of appropriate insurance policies. 
UBI Banca has concurrently supported the establishment of an Observatory to monitor trends 
in  corporate  welfare  and  related  topics,  to  promote  knowledge  and  dissemination  of 
instruments provided under Law No. 2016/2017 on Stability. These instruments are designed 
to improve industrial relations and the business climate in general, to increase productivity 
and  wage  purchasing  power,  while  monitoring  the  spread  of  good  practices  and  their 
repercussions on the local social and economic fabric.
