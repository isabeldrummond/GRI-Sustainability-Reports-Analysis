Unione di Banche Italiane S.p.A. (UBI Banca in abbreviated form) is the parent bank of the 
UBI Banca Group and was formed on 1st April 2007 following the merger of Banca Lombarda e 
Piemontese into Banche Popolari Unite, with the consequent integration of the two groups of 
the same name. Formed in 2007 as a “popular” co-operative bank, UBI Banca acquired its 
current  legal  form  as  an  ordinary  joint-stock  company  following  a  resolution  of  an 
Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting held on 10th October 2015 in accordance with Law No. 
33 of 24th March 2015.  
The registered office of the Bank is in Bergamo and its operating headquarters are in Bergamo 
and Brescia. As laid down in the Articles of Association, shareholders’ meetings are held 
alternately in the city or province of Bergamo and in the city or province of Brescia, while the 
Supervisory Board and the Management Board meet alternately in the city of Bergamo and in 
the city of Brescia and generally once a year in the city of Milan.

Physical proximity is still a characteristic of 
the Group's local presence and integration in the communities, even in the context of a 
gradual  rationalisation  and  optimization  of  the  distribution  network  as  customers  rely 
increasing on digital services. 
While most of the Group's branches are located in more developed, affluent areas in Central 
and Northern Italy, the Group’s presence is also significant in less developed regions1 (252 
branches accounting for 13.7% of the total) as well as small rural centres and mountain areas 
(24% of the branches are located in municipalities with populations of less than 5,000, while it 
is the only banking option present in 197 municipalities). 
In addition to the Group’s conventional physical channels, it continues its efforts to upgrade 
its instruments and applications in support of direct channels:
