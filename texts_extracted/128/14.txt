       [GRI 102-14] 
Banking activity plays a fundamental role in everyday life by providing support for households 
and enterprises in making complex financial decisions in a constantly-changing environment 
characterised  by  changes  with  unprecedented  speed,  intensity,  and  scope.  The  digital 
revolution is leading to profound changes in the approach to banking. The availability of data 
and  advanced  information  technology  provide  new  opportunities  to  understand  clients' 
requirements, and to propose “bespoke" products and services. The regulatory environment 
promotes  ongoing  improvements  through  new  rules,  guidelines,  and  standards  for  the 
industry within a banking system that is becoming increasingly integrated at the European 
level.  Climate  change  has  had  a  powerful  influence  on  global  economic  systems  and  on 
decisions made by households, not always leading to reactions that we might expect in the 
scientific, political, ethical and social areas.  
Against this backdrop, UBI intends to create the vision of a bank that is distinguished by 
quality: sound, reliable, efficient, and convenient; a bank that makes life easier for people and 
that supports the local economy, finding new solutions to meet the demands of customers, the 
local community, and investors, to improve relations with staff and suppliers, 
while  putting  regulatory  compliance  and  respect  for  people  and  the 
environment  first.  Accordingly,  UBI  Banca  intends  to  contribute  to  the 
promotion of the universal principles of the Global Compact, to which it is a 
signatory, and to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDG)  outlined  in  the  United  Nations  2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable 
Development.  
The macroeconomic scenario is showing important signs of structural reinforcement in the key 
indicators, and has opened the way for 2018 to be a year of significant expansion in the Italian 
economy, according to all of the major research and forecasting institutions, although still 
falling short of the average for the euro area. Potential risk factors are nonetheless present in 
connection with the growth slowdown in emerging economies, potential deterioration in the 
international geopolitical scene, and pressure on the financial markets reacting to monetary 
policy trends, more specifically with reference to the European Central Bank's decisions on 
Quantitative Easing policy. 
UBI Group looks to a future with strengthened corporate governance as a result of  important 
activities carried out during the past two years, more specifically with reference to (i) the 10th 
October 2016 conversion into an ordinary joint stock company (formerly the largest “popular” 
co-operative bank in Italy) to ensure corporate stability and focus as much as possible on 
routine management activities; (ii) adoption of a unified operating structure, a “Single Bank”, 
following its successful integration, earlier than programmed, of the local banks, with the 
benefits of cost savings and a more uniform service model. 
Under the 2016/2017-2020 Business Plan, a strategy of sustainable growth was defined, 
aiming  to  meet  demand  for  sound  credit  and  to  manage  clients'  wealth  responsibly  in 
compliance with the principle of Fare Banca per bene (to bank fairly and well). This principle 
summarises  the  objective  of  creating  sustainable  value  for  all  stakeholders  over  time, 
combining  simplicity,  quality  and  innovation  to  make  products,  services  and  excellent 
relations available to clients, contributing to the well-being of the community with support for 
social and cultural initiatives and cultivating individuals' talents, passion, and commitment.  
The Business Plan provides the following key initiatives: (i) development of the distribution 
system with a multichannel approach; (ii) execution of a strategy for the targeted commercial 
segment; (iii) confirmation of the quality of loans granted and adequate coverage of  non-
performing loans; (iv) rationalization of the cost base; (v) maintaining a sound financial and 
capital balance; and (vi) implementation of initiatives consistent with the logic of optimising 
risk-adjusted profitability. The merger of the new banks acquired from the National Resolution
