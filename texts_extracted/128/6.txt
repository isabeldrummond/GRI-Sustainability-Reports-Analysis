2015, when the resolution was filed with the Bergamo Company Register, UBI Banca became 
an “S.p.A.” (ordinary joint stock company). The former “registered shareholders” have now 
become ordinary shareholders. There is only one class of ordinary shares, each of which 
grants the bearer the right to vote in a shareholders’ meeting.
