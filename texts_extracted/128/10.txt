The geographic distribution of funding and lending shows a preponderance of Northern Italy, 
and more specifically Lombardy, as the group's main market.11.  
The distribution of lending is consistent with the Group's mission to support local economies: 
more than half of the Group's business involves production companies in a wide range of 
economic sectors, and primarily manufacturing, property, trade, and construction activities. 
The Group's customers are predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises, which in total 
account for 3/4 of the lending to businesses. 
The distribution network is based on seven Macro Geographical areas (MATs) and includes the 
Bank's online banking and product company brands. IT activities and other support functions 
are  managed  by  UBI  Sistemi  e  Servizi,  while  training  and  professional  and  managerial 
development activities are carried out by UBI Academy.
