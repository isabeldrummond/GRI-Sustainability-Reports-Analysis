1 In 2017, the following were excluded from the professional assessment perimeter: Newly-recruited personnel, those
  on leave, staff of minor companies in the Group, and personnel on external contracts. Of the total number of 2017 
  professional assessment cards, 24 cards were associated with employees classified as ND (external operations base)
  who have not been included in this table.
 
A new step in the process was introduced in 2017: Self-assessment, which is the option for all 
employees  to  express  their  opinions  on  the  components  being  evaluated  by  the  relevant 
manager. All of the foregoing is consistent with the purpose of the instrument: awareness and 
ongoing discussion to promote development paths consistent with the professional objectives 
of the individuals and the requirements of the organization. This approach is also supported 
by the various Assessment activities (on an individual and group basis, with supervision and 
management  focuses),  differentiated  to  reflect  the  tools  and  processes  in  relation  to  the 
different company populations, consistent with the scope of the activity: to gather useful 
information to design a series of development activities. The 190 colleagues involved during 
2017 in these initiatives have in fact benefited from individual feedback, making it possible to 
provide practical follow-up on the information. 
To  expand  knowledge  of  the  New  Banks  employees  and  to  have  data  to  support  future 
management  decisions,  in  September  2017,  an  online  assessment  activity  focusing  on 
Business and Private consultants and senior management of branches, designed to assess 
performance in this capacity in terms of technical knowledge and management skills. 
Moreover, Individual coaching (20) and Team coaching (35) activities were intensified during 
2017,  with  a  view  to  the  improved  use  of  management  skills  in  the  Bank's  specific 
organizational context. In addition, the group's commitment to policies focusing on planning 
appropriate generational turnover to cover prospective management roles has continued. 
More specifically, management and development activities of personnel involved in the talent 
project drew from ongoing management and training activities with a high level of professional 
and  managerial  specialisation  designed  to  promote  personalised  growth  and  functional 
courses to consolidate the skills the organization requires and to create reservoirs for the 
managerial turnover and continuity.
