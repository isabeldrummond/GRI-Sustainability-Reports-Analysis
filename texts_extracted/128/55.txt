In the preparation of corporate welfare plans, UBI Banca aims to harmonize at the group level 
the  various  forms  of  supplementary  pension  and  assistance  benefits  and  existing  staff 
insurance policies so that adequate levels of benefits are provided in the different companies of 
the Group. 
In support of younger colleagues as they enter the work force, regulations were introduced to 
enhance  the  corporate  contribution  to  supplementary  pension  schemes  and  first-home-
purchase incentives. Additional welfare benefits are supported through the reimbursement of 
certain  incurred  household  expenses  (e.g.  schools  of  all  types  and  at  all  levels,  campus 
expenses,  textbooks,  canteen  services  and  care  for  elderly  family  members)  or  through 
education/recreation and sports services provided by the Bank.
