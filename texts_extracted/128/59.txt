Fortunately, in 2017 as well, cases effectively observed were extremely insignificant in terms of 
numbers and severity. 
Training (52,607 hours in 2017) is another essential component of prevention to ensure that 
the concept of " Participatory security " is as widespread as possible. The training programmed 
are prepared in co-operation with UBI Academy and the corporate physicians with account 
taken of the different levels of risk to which employees are exposed as a function of their 
individual  roles.  Their  level  of  completion  by  each  employee  is  monitored  through  an 
integrated information system that can be used to program and report on training activities in 
each business.
