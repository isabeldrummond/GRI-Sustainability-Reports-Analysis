1 The reductions of 1,326 positions during 2017 under the Business Plan do not reflect the 53 terminations in  
  connection   with the New Banks during the period 1st January until 31st March 2017.
 
Generational turnover activities primarily involved terminations (1,254) in connection with the 
early  departure  plan  implemented  under  the  trade  union  agreements  signed  on  11th 
December 2016 and subsequent arrangements. At the Group level, they include acquisitions 
and transfers of business sectors. The substitution index was equal to approximately 41 
percent, corresponding to one incoming resource for every two departures. Women accounted 
for 34.70% of the personnel leaving and 63.13% of those leaving were working in locations in 
Northern Italy. Voluntary turnover was substantially unchanged at 0.8% as against 0.6% in 
2016 and 0.7% in 2015.
