 
 
With regard to major project finance investments, the consolidation process of the ownership 
and  management  of  photovoltaic  installations  and  to  refinance  many  operations  became 
stronger in 2017, following the entry into force of the “spalma incentivi” (spread the incentives) 
decree at the end of 2015. 
The sector has attracted the attention of major investors because expansionary monetary 
policies  have  always  made  the  guaranteed  returns  on  investments  in  renewables  more 
attractive  and  UBI  Banca  has  continued  to  play  a  significant  role  in  supporting  Italian 
investors, participating in some of the most interesting inter-bank transactions at a national 
level. In particular, this involves the acquisition of clusters of installations (PV, wind etc.) that 
have been managed using structured finance matched to output, guarantees and market 
pricing. The construction of new installations has decreased.

In  total,  at  the  end  of  2017  UBI  Banca  had  a  portfolio  of  renewable  energy  operations 
amounting to €1.9 billion (of which €1.2 billion in project finance). The transactions concluded 
during the year in the renewable energy field numbered 49, to give a total amount disbursed of 
€234.2 million. It is estimated that the power output financed in project finance by UBI Banca 
amounts  to  1.4  million  MWh  of  electricity  per  year,  equal  to  the  domestic  electricity 
requirement  of  an  entire  region  such  as  Liguria,  with  savings  on  emissions  of  over  452 
thousand tons of CO .
