Calculation method
Paper: consumptionismultipliedbytheunderlyingCEPIemissionscoefficientwhichreferssolely toemissions
generated for the production of pulp, paper and cardboard in firms/paper mills. The Confederation of European 
Paper Industries (CEPI) is a nonprofit organisation which represents approximately 495 companies that
produce pulp, paperand cardboard and 900 papermills foran overalltotal thataccounts forapproximately
22% of world production. 
Business travel: emissions of the company car fleet already reported under indicator 305-1 are excluded. The 
kilometres travelled by air were retrieved from the IATA certified management app provided by the travel
agency. TheInternationalAirTransportAssociation(IATA) isatradeassociation towhich airlinesfrom allover
theworld belong and itrepresents approximately 280 airlines, i.e. 83%of totalairtraffic.On thebasis ofthe
method provided by the Italian Banking Association, the kilometres travelled fordomestic, internationaland
intercontinental trips were multiplied by the respective emissions coefficients calculated as the weighted
averageof themain routes (in terms of thenumberof trips and distances), using theICAO CarbonEmissions
Calculator app. The kilometres travelled by train were retrieved from themanagement app provided by the
travelagency.Onthebasisofthemethodprovided bytheItalianBanking Association,thekilometrestravelled
by train were multiplied by the respective emissions coefficients calculated as the weighted average of the
main routes (number of trips and distances) using the app Ecopassenger. The kilometres travelled by
employees in their own petrol or diesel powered cars have been multiplying by the underlying emissions
coefficients. 
Shuttle coach: the tons of gas oil have been multiplied by the emissions factors taken from the ISPRA
databaseof averageroad transportemission factors. CO equivalentemissions includeCO , CH and N O and

have been calculated using the IPCC 100 year GWPs for CH4 (28) and N2O (265).   
 
 
GHG EMISSIONS INTENSITY
Calculation method
Total emissions do not include Scope 3 emissions (305-3) and include scope 1 emissions (305-1) and the 
residual emissions of the scope 2 (305-2) not covered by GO certificates. Total emissions were divided by 
the number of employees and associate workers (21,495 amounting to 100% of the Group total) and by 
the net internal floor area of the properties (1,267.931 sq m) of the Group companies within the relative 
scope.
