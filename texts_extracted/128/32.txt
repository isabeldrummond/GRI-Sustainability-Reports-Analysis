  excluded from the report arms for sports and hunting and the  relative ammunition, reproductions of antique

  armed forces or the police, and transactions performed on behalf of the government (Art. 8 Law No. 
 185/1990) or within the framework of joint intergovernmental programmes (Art. 13 paragraph 1, Law No. 
 185/1990). 
2 Arms which, because of their specifications or technical and construction or design  characteristics, are to be

  185/1990).
3 Ordinary firearms pursuant to Art. 2 of Law No. 110 of 18th April 1975 and short firearms provided they are

In compliance with the commitment to transparency provided under the Group's arms policy, 
a more detailed report on the operations in question is published in the Social Responsibility 
Section  of  the  Group’s  corporate  website  concurrently  with  the  publication  of  the 
Government's report to Parliament under Law No. 185/19906. 
Where the gambling and gaming sector7 is concerned, the internal directive provides that 
operations in this sector are completely marginal and that extremely stringent procedures are 
used in the assessment of financing applications. In addition to meeting creditworthiness 
requirements, transactors in this sector must already be favourably known to the bank and 
meet  criteria  for  absolute  integrity,  seriousness  and  reliability.

Last, the Group has a pending commercial bid on the sale of diamonds to clients and with the 
acquisition of Nuova Banca Etruria, it also acquired an activity in the gold sector. For these 
activities as well, potential involvement in activities that might entail risks of human right 
violations is considered. Accordingly, diamonds are purchased through Diamond Love Bond,8

7 The organisation of gaming and betting in those European countries which allow it is managed by 
central governments which sub-contract operations to private sector companies in return for the 
payment of license fees. In Italy, laws allow gaming and betting activities to be run by companies 
authorised by government, which intends in this manner to exercise stringent control over a highly 
profitable sector with a high risk of illegality. 
8 Diamond Love Bond is a diamond company located in Antwerp authorised by the Belgian Ministry of 
the Economy, Commerce and Energy, with an international organisational network and it is present on

link between illegal diamond transactions and armed conflicts.
