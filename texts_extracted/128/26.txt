 
 
Shareholders  
Share capital is composed of ordinary shares, each of which has equal dividend rights. As a 
result of its capital strength, UBI Banca has consistently been able to pay a dividend to the 
shareholders, even during the most difficult years.  
In addition to shareholder dividends, this item includes the Group's profits attributale to non-
controlling shareholders included in the consolidation. 
 
Suppliers  
The  economic  value  distributed  to  suppliers  accounts  for  98%  of  the  turnover  of  local 
suppliers, which are defined for that purpose as suppliers resident in Italy. When possible and 
advisable  owing to the type  of goods and  services acquired, suppliers operating near the 
operational locations are used. 
 
Public administration  
UBI  Banca  has  never  received  any  form  of  government  assistance.  It  has  engaged  in 
transactions with central banks in the framework of financing programmes (e.g. TLTRO) to 
promote financial stability or to facilitate monetary policy transmission. 
 
Community and environment  
The economic value of belonging to a community and the environment is represented by the 
costs  sustained  during  the  fiscal  year  for  social  purposes  (independently  of  the  actual 
payments during the same year) or the profit allocated to the reserve available to the corporate 
bodies (see "Board's Fund").  The framework of contributing to social organizations marginally 
reflects  initiatives  to  promote  conservation  of  the  environment.  However,  the  Group  has 
devoted  substantial,  consistent  expenditure  and  investments  to  reduce  its  environmental 
impacts, that are not reflected in the distribution of the economic value created.
