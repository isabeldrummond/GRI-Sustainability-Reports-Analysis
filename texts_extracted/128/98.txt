ORGANISATION
Calculation methodology
Energy savingswere calculatedusing thecoefficients reportedfordisclosure302-1. Forthecalculationof
savings for boilers and air conditioning systems the different outputs of new machines compared with
those replaced were used mainly, while for electricity reference was made to specific design ratios or
invoice figures for the years 2016 and 2017.
