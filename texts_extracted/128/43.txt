 
Commitment to the local economy 
   
UBI Banca pursues a growth path which must develop hand-in-hand with that of the local 
economies it serves. Its mission is to use household  savings to finance their life projects as 
well as entrepreneurial projects - creating a virtuous circle between savings, consumption and 
investment, creating shared value, generating growth and well-being at the local level through 
the capacity to select and sustain confirmed economic realities and those that may be less 
robust  but  that  entail  a  wealth  of  new  opportunities  and  outlooks  -  and  to  provide 
households,  social  organisations  and  enterprises  with  innovative  services  to  address 
constantly-changing demands through specialised distribution structures.     
Considering the increasingly important role the civil economy plays in the country's economic 
and social development, with a considerable impact from the standpoint of employment and 
in meeting the requirements of the community, in 2011, UBI Banca created a service model 
available on an ad hoc basis to non-profit organizations with the brand of UBI Comunità. With 
UBI  Banca's  new  organisational  approach  introduced  in  2017,  UBI  Comunità  became  a 
commercial  division  under  the  Chief  Commercial  Officer,  devoted  to  developing  relations 
between public entities and the private social sector. Within UBI Comunità, the Third Sector 
and Civil Economy Service promotes and supports economic initiatives in partnership with 
the  public,  private  and  social  private  sectors,  building  on  relationships  and  positive 
experiences,  supporting  high  social  impact  investments  and  social  entrepreneurship 
mechanisms to support development of local areas, communities and new supply chains, in 
which the Bank serves as a partner in the growth of both Church and non-Church non-profit 
organisations. In 2017, the Service was strengthened with the gradual introduction of a 
commercial force dedicated to the development and management of relations (the first 13 
resources,  specialised  and  adequately  trained,  were  assigned  to  areas  having  higher 
concentrations  of  customers  in  the  sector)  and  the  commercial  synergies  cutting  across 
different markets and sectors and involving relations with public players were reinforced.  
In response to the public welfare crisis and leveraging on incentives in terms of taxes and 
contributions provided under the current regulatory texts, UBI Banca was the first in Italy to 
structure a supply of corporate welfare services under the brand of UBI Welfare. Corporate 
welfare  instruments  are  designed  to  meet  the  needs  of  workers  and  their  families  by 
integrating  public  services  in  the  fields  of  health,  pensions,  education,  leisure  time  and 
protection and to more effectively reconcile work and family life. It provides a substantial 
opportunity to make enterprises more competitive and to strengthen the purchasing power of 
the workers through improvements in productivity, the business climate, worker satisfaction, 
and the company's capacity to attract and retain talent. Responsibility for UBI Welfare is 
incumbent on the commercial division responsible for Welfare and Protection, reporting to the 
Chief Wealth & Welfare Officer established in 2016, having the following broader mission: 
  to adapt customer advisory services to planning of financial well-being for persons and 
households throughout the life cycle; 
  meeting key financial requirements in different phases of the life cycle for persons and 
their  families,  helping  protect  the  quality  of  life  in  old  age  through  an  integrated, 
innovative and broad spectrum in asset management and insurance coverage; 
  incorporating an increasingly relevant supply of social, health care and welfare services. 
The framework of public entities is subject to constantly changing rules and is affected by 
changes in progress in Italy's structural policies, as well as the national economic situation. 
Accordingly,  UBI  Banca,  through  services,  products  and  consulting  offered  by  the  UBI 
Comunità  area,  targeting  entities,  municipalities,  universities,  academic  institutions, 
hospitals, provinces, and a variety of different institutions, serves in its capacity as a local
