As  concerns  communication  through  the 
social  media,  initiatives  are  ongoing  to 
enhance  social  public  interest  and 
interactions  in  these  forums.  More 
specifically,  on  Facebook,  UBI  Banca's 
activities focused on expanding its community 
to  244,000  fans  (up  25%  on  the  previous 
year), with more than 150 million UBI Banca 
content views (up 39% compared with 2016) 
reaching an average of 3 million persons each 
month. On Instagram, a number of activities 
were commenced leading to an annual growth 
of 37% in followers and a 32% increase in 
engagement  through  an  additional  300 
published content items. Our Linkedin editorial and recruiting activities for which Human 
Resources  is  responsible  made  it  possible  to  reach  50,900  followers,  including  4,800 
employees,  with  a  further  216,000  job  vacancy  views.  Last,  on  Youtube,  the  UBI  Banca 
channel in 2017 to all intents and purposes tripled the minutes of video viewing from just over 
4 million to 11 million. 
In 2018 the Bank intends to introduce a programme for consultations with stakeholders more 
directly  related  to  the  management  of  important  sustainability  issues,  to  steer  the 
incorporation of important environmental and social issues into the long-term strategies, in 
the framework of the Group's strategic planning process.
