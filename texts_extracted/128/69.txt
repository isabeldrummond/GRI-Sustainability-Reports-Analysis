Under national collective bargaining agreements, processing steps and a minimum period of 
45  days  is  established  for  negotiations  with  the  Trade  Union  Organizations  to  make 
substantial  organizational  changes.  During  2017,  104  meetings  with  trade  union 
representatives were held, entailing a total of 780 hours, leading to the execution of important 
agreements designed to management of reflexes on the personnel affected by operations to 
optimise the Group's structure. 
The 2017-2020 update of the Group's business plan, in the wake of the acquisition of three 
new Banks from the Resolution Fund, led to the October 2017 signing of the Framework 
Agreement  governing  the  merger  of  these  Banks  with  the  Group,  providing  flexible 
mechanisms to enable to pursue the efficiency and productivity objectives provided under the

In 2017, the Group also undertook agreements with the trade union organizations to establish 
a single system for all UBI staff, to optimise costs, facilitate the gradual departure of workers 
nearing retirement age, and promote generational turnover. Below is a summary of the key 
areas in which negotiations were undertaken with trade union representatives during 2017:

Framework Agreement of 26 October 2017 governing the merger of the New Banks with UBI
