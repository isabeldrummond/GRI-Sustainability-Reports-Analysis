1 The 2017 energy consumption of Banca Tirrenica and Banca Federico del Vecchio is not included due to data 
  collection difficulties. 
2 The 2016 figure for business travel has been restated following an update of the method used to calculate with 
  reference to railway travel.
3 The 2017 energy consumption of the New Banks is not included due to data collection difficulties  
 
ENERGY INTENSITY 2017 2016
Total energy consumption (GJ) 701,561 528,742
Energy intensity per employee (GJ/employees) 32.68 30.18
Energy intensity by surface area (GJ/Sq.m) 0.55 0.55
 
Increases in energy consumption are mainly due to heating and are caused partly by a winter 
that was colder than the previous one and above all by the extension of the area reported on to 
include the New Banks. These banks operate in areas where there is a greater dependence on 
heating systems that use fossil fuels.

Emissions 
The  emissions  produced  by  the  Group  mainly  relate  to  greenhouse  gases  and  the  other 
pollutants produced by  the  use of energy from fossil fuels, whereas emissions  of  ozone-
depleting gases were not found to be significant. 
Emissions are monitored using the annual reporting cycle of the Sustainability Report and 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).  
A major contribution to the overall reduction of emissions is also made by reducing the 
amount of commuting to and from work and the increasing use of sustainable transport. This 
reduction in mobility is influenced by smart working (from home or the nearest Group office), 
which started in 2015 and has significantly increased in 2017 with 4,560 days worked, saving 
an average of approximately 428,502 kilometres and avoiding the emission of at least 66,047 
tons of CO . Another contribution to more sustainable mobility is made by providing sheltered 
2
bicycle parking at some of the Bank’s main premises and a coach shuttle service running 
between our Bergamo, Varese, Brescia and Milan offices (and also around the city of Milan). 
The  shuttle  coaches  transported  an  average  of  310  passengers  per  day  in  2017  which 
prevented at least 1,000 tons of CO  emissions compared with the use of cars.
