 
Calculation method 
Paper:consumption is multiplied bytheunderlying CEPIcoefficientwhich refers to energyconsumed forthe
production ofpulp, paperand cardboard in firms/papermills. TheConfederation of European PaperIndustries
(CEPI) isanonprofitorganisation whichrepresents approximately495 companiesthatproducepulp, paperand
cardboard and 900 paper mills for an overall total that accounts for approximately 22% of world production. 
Business travel: energy consumption by the company car fleet already reported under disclosure 302-1 is
excluded. The kilometres travelled by air were retrieved from the IATA certified management app provided by the 
travelagency. TheInternationalAirTransportAssociation (IATA)is atradeassociationto whichairlines fromall
overtheworldbelong anditrepresentsapproximately 280airlines (83%oftotalairtraffic).On thebasis ofthe
method provided by the Italian Banking Association, the kilometres travelled for domestic, international and
intercontinentaltrips weremultiplied bytherespective coefficients calculated as the weighted average of the
mainroutes(numberoftripsanddistances).Thekilometrestravelledbyhigh-speedtrainandothertypes oftrain
wereretrieved from themanagementapp provided bythetravelagency. On thebasis ofthemethodprovided
bytheItalianBankingAssociation,thekilometrestravelledbytrainweremultipliedbytherespectivecoefficients
calculated as the weighted average of the main routes (number of trips and distances) using the app
Ecopassenger. For business travel using personal cars, the CO2 emissions (see 305-3) were divided by the
following "ISPRA - Database of average road transport emission factors in Italy" coefficients: 3,127944 tons
CO2/tons petrol and 2,992202 tons CO2/tons gas oil. The tons of fuel of obtained were multiplied by the
underlying coefficients. 
Shuttle coach: the tons of gas oil were multiplied by the underlying coefficient. 
 
 
ENERGY INTENSITY
Calculation method
Energy intensity does not include energy consumption outside the organisation (302-2) and was
calculated by dividing total energy consumption within the organisation (302-1) by the number of
employeesandassociateworkers(21.465amounting to100%oftheGroup total)and bythe netinternal
floor area of properties (1.267.931 sq m) of the Group companies within the relative scope.
