1 Does not include regulatory training on the MiFID Directive, which is included in the “Finance and MiFID”.

  have attended more than one course in different subject areas.   
Training activities are managed by UBI Academy, the Corporate University of the UBI Group, 
whose object is the study, planning, consultancy and provision of services for the training and 
the professional and managerial development of UBI Group Bank in support of its business 
objectives. The purpose of the training activities is to achieve an ongoing improvement in the 
professional level of all employees of the Group, which is tantamount to working in the best 
interest of our customers, with an operating approach that is increasingly focused on 360° 
consultancy, appropriateness of investor services and greater awareness and preparation in 
order to reduce risks of non-compliance and those in connection with transparency. All of 
these activities are designed for more widespread improvements in productivity.  
From a management standpoint, all training initiatives are structured and planned to reflect 
the organizational and management requirements of the company business with the support 
of  Human  Resources;  requirements  are  assessed  and  training  plans  are  prepared  on  an 
annual basis with reference to the Business Plan and requirements identified by the heads of 
each of the parent company’s operating areas. Special emphasis is placed on the preparation, 
in cooperation with the relevant reference units, of training activities to support continuous 
education on the current regulations and relevant developments. As an indication of the 
importance of compliance with the rules and the quality of the training content, the didactic 
material  on  technical  banking,  commercial,  credit  and  financial  topics  to  support  the 
classroom activities is subject to approval from the Group's compliance authorities. 
Intensive internal communication and training activities are designed to be an effective tool to 
spread  and  enhance  the  wealth  of  technical  and  professional  knowledge,  management 
experiences and skills, ethical and cultural behaviours of persons belonging to the UBI Banca 
Group, promoting the spread of a unified corporate identity. People are at the centre of the 
training process, through motivation to take action with a view to the continuous improvement 
in the three basic components: knowledge, can-do, and can-be: We offer examples of excellent 
performance drawing from best practices, persons of value representing professional examples 
and role models.  
UBI  Academy  uses  a  Quality  Management  System  as  an  additional  guarantee  for  all 
stakeholders, formalising and instituting procedures aimed at continuous improvement in the 
services offered. UBI Academy periodically undergoes internal and external audits for the 
verification and confirmation of its ISO 9001 quality certification, and since the beginning of 
2017, the transition to ISO 9001. In 2015, risks in business processes and the appropriate 
measures to be adopted to manage them were identified, along with opportunities, possible 
solutions and measures to address them. On an annual basis, the Quality Manager uses the 
information received as a basis to record the verified cases of noncompliance. On that basis, 
he or she identifies the actions required to prevent them and/or to eliminate the underlying 
causes. The head of the Quality unit is also the point of reference for receiving and managing 
any complaints or grievances received from different stakeholders.
