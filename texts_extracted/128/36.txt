Sustainability  governance  provides  opportunities  for  discussion  and  dialogue  with 
stakeholders to identify their expectations in connection with the Group's activities. In drafting 
the Code of Ethics, UBI Banca has identified the major categories of stakeholders: customers, 
staff, investors, suppliers, communities (with particular reference to local communities), public 
authorities,  operators  on  the  financial  market,  the  media  and  opinion  leaders  and 
organizations representing stakeholders' interests. 
Current activities in terms of consultations with stakeholders involve shareholders (through 
Shareholders’ Meetings held as provided in the Articles of Association, at least on an annual 
basis in connection with the publication of the financial statements, and meetings in the field 
with senior management in connection with significant events in the life of the Bank, such as 
the development and implementation of the Single Bank Project in 2017), operators on the 
financial  market  and  the  media  (through  investor  and  media  relations  activities,  on  an 
intensified basis in connection with important dates on the financial calendar), employees 
(through periodic consultations with trade union organizations and studies on organisational 
well-being), and customers (through customer satisfaction surveys conducted systematically 
during the year).
