Financial education       [FS16] 
UBI Banca aims to contribute to the effort that all institutions need to make to respond to 
current social and economic changes by starting an open dialogue with the local community. 
The actions undertaken by UBI Banca with this in view include raising awareness about using 
financial resources responsibly and promoting the propensity to save that has always been 
characteristic of Italian households, with the objective of training economically-aware citizens 
and directing financial activities towards values of legality and transparency, partly as a result 
of the involvement of banks at a local level.  
To achieve this the Group has, over the years, developed a structured financial education 
programme throughout the areas where it operates: a project involving many units working in 
synergy to promote financial education together with the contribution of the Foundation for 
Financial and Savings Education (FEDUF). 
Young people are the segment that benefits most from an adequate level of financial literacy; it 
is an essential tool for entering the labour market, developing skills that allow them to act with 
awareness and teaching entrepreneurship to give them a better chance of success in the world 
of work. The following educational programmes are designed for schools:  
  Kids Programme for primary schools, to explain the economy to 
the very young while they have fun; 
  Junior Programme, an educational resource for children in the 
first year of secondary school that introduces them to economic 
citizenship issues by encouraging them to reflect on the principal 
functions of finance and their impact on people’s everyday lives; 
  Teens  Programme,  for  older  secondary  school  pupils,  which 
introduces  the  basic  notions  needed  for  a  real  knowledge  of 
economic rules, preparing the young people to become join and 
actively  participate  in  the  social,  cultural,  professional  and 
economic reality that surrounds them.
