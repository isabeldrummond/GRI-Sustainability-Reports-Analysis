SALES AREAS
Development efforts focused especially on the Despar and Eurospar brands. Specifically, the latter boasts the larg-
est surface areas—a testament to the success of the medium-sized format.

The value of franchisees
Aspiag Service creates added value by promoting the local community in several ways: one of these is 
to affiliate local entrepreneurs with Despar. Besides the necessary technical aspects, franchising our 
brand involves constant engagement through shared activities, working groups and discussions on the 
most material topics, bringing franchisees more and more into line with the direct channel in terms of 
recognition and quality.
PDA - Personal Digital Assistant
The sales process and customer service are constantly improving thanks to the research into innovations 
conducted by the sales area. This year, the introduction of PDAs at both direct and franchise stores has 
revolutionised the quality of the work performed there. The PDA is an Android-based tool that replaces 
the PDT and allows to update trends, inflows of goods, offers, rejected products, and much more so as to 
plan orders more rationally. The new application has allowed to eliminate measurement errors on over 
390,000 orders placed by employees. This new system has significantly reduced waste and breakages 
within the store, especially in the fresh produce section. Moreover, the availability of information on the 
device allowed to cut the production of the paper listings required under the previous system by 20%, 
in line with Aspiag Service’s values.
