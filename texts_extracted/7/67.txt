The factors used to calculate emissions are taken from the “UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting” tables 
published by DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs). As for the 2019 indirect emissions related to the electricity 
purchased from Italy’s national power grid, we used the emission factor developed by Terna (updated in 2017).

305-3 Note: the Scope 3 CO equivalent emissions deriving from outbound logistics (freight transport from distribution centres to retail 
2
stores) were calculated using the number of km travelled by each vehicle as the primary data and using the emission factors expressed 
in kg of CO equivalent per km as indicated in the “UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting” tables published 
2
by DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs). The choice of conversion factor depended on the type of vehicle 
(articulated, rigid) and weight (> 3.5 - 7.5 tonnes, > 7.5 tonnes - 17 tonnes, >17 tonnes), and considered an average load per vehicle.
