Note: Aspiag Service manages the collection of sorted waste at all retail stores. This is mainly for paper, cardboard, plastic, wood 
or glass packaging, mixed packaging, hazardous waste, F.O.R.S.U. (Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste) and R.S.U. (Unsorted 
Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste). Since sorted waste is collected by municipal companies that do not measure the production of 
each user but only the total quantity collected, data on the dry and wet fractions are calculated empirically using:
• the number of weekly collections;
• the number of dumpsters/bins in use;
• a ﬁ lling coefﬁ cient of the dumpsters/bins.
In cases where the reference municipalities do not collect certain types of waste, the Company relies on private disposers. For R.S.U. 
collection containers (average volume of 1100 l), an average ﬁ ll weight of 88 kg was assumed; for F.O.R.S.U. collection bins (average 
volume of 240 l), an average ﬁ ll weight of 120 kg was assumed.
Method of disposal:
Items referred to in points 1) and 2) public service waste collection - composting; landﬁ ll/waste-to-energy plant. Item referred to in 
point 3), 4) authorised private disposal companies - composting - recycling.
Item 4 covers polyethylene, wood, glass, iron and steel, waste vegetable oil, materials unsuitable for consumption or processing and 
animal by-products.
