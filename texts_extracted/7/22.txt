To give our customers maximum value, we work with a variety of goods and 
services suppliers who meet established standards allowing them to offer high-
quality products and a comprehensive choice.
The various phases of our distribution system convey products to the retail 
stores, also with the help of the four distribution centres (Ce.Di.) in Bolzano, 
Mestrino (province of Padua), Udine, and Castel San Pietro Terme (province 
of Bologna), which oversee all stores and bring the Company even closer to the 
local community.
