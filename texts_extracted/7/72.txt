Trade-off 
The presentation of the key trade-offs of the different types of capital shows how they interact with each other and 
how their value changes over time. We describe below the interdependencies between capitals, highlighting the 
main impacts in the value creation process over the three-year period 2017-2019. The qualitative and quantitative 
analysis of the actions undertaken on each capital was carried out by reclassifying the average data for the three 
years in question, shown in the tables in “Performance”.
