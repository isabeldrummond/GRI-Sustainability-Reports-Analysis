GRI To monitor our stores, we use supervisory systems allowing to measure energy withdrawal and detect abnor-
mal energy consumption. The stores are remotely monitored and grouped into clusters based on brand, size, and 
302-4
installed equipment, so as to identify consumption standards and monitor any potential anomalies by using dedi-
cated algorithms.
Average daily energy consumption was down 1.45% year-on-year, allowing to save €377,165 in energy costs.
The Company continues using renewable energy sources—specifically from photovoltaic systems—LED lighting, 
which is still being implemented, and energy with guarantees of origin (“green energy”). We prevent frozen foods 
from thawing by carefully managing them.

The factors used to calculate emissions are taken from the “UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting” tables 
published by DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs). As for the 2019 indirect emissions related to the electricity 
purchased from Italy’s national power grid, we used the emission factor developed by Terna (updated in 2017).

Indirect (Scope 3) emissions related to logistics’ transport 14,678   14,896   14,203 
Note: the Scope 3 CO equivalent emissions deriving from outbound logistics (freight transport from distribution centres to retail 
2
stores) were calculated using the number of km travelled by each vehicle as the primary data and using the emission factors expressed 
in kg of CO equivalent per km as indicated in the “UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting” tables published 
2
by DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs). The choice of conversion factor depended on the type of vehicle 
(articulated, rigid) and weight (> 3.5 - 7.5 tonnes, > 7.5 tonnes - 17 tonnes, >17 tonnes), and considered an average load per vehicle.
