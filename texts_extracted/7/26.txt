With respect to warehouse handling, ECR GS1 (Efficient 
consumer response - Global standard) experts contin-
ued providing training on pallet handling and safety: 
the goal is to define a single certifiable standard. For 
fruit and vegetable products as well as others, we use 
100% reusable plastic crates as a partial replacement 
for conventional one-way cardboard, wood and plas-
tic packaging. Reusable crates ensure higher quality, 
fresher and more hygienic products as well as reduced 
waste, and their use is being extended to more and 
more product categories. In 2019, the Company used 
13,914,475 reusable crates.
The synergy between the various deliveries—which in 
some cases are made just in time—and the appropri-
ate technologies implemented allow to restock shelves 
at a low cost and reduce inventories, striking a balance 
between expiration dates, customer demands, and 
promotional trends. Products are withdrawn a few 
days before they expire in order to be recovered and 
donated to local charitable organisations helping peo-
ple in need.
