The severity index was calculated as: (number of days lost due to injury/hours worked) x 1,000.
The rate of occupational disease was calculated as: (number of cases of occupational disease/hours worked) x 200,000.
The rate of absenteeism was calculated as: (number of days absent due to injury or illness/workable days) x 100.
The injury rate/frequency rate was calculated as: (number of injuries/hours worked) x 1,000,000.
The rate of recordable work-related injuries was calculated as: (number of recordable work-related injuries/hours worked) x 1,000,000.
The rate of high-consequence work-related injuries was calculated as: (number of high-consequence work-related injuries/hours worked) x 1,000,000.
The rate of fatalities as a result of work-related injury was calculated as: (number of fatalities as a result of work-related injury/hours worked) x 1,000,000.
* The severity index has been recalculated by no longer comparing it workable hours but to hours worked, so 2018 has also been revised.
** Data reported since 2019 as per 403 - Occupation health and safety GRI Standards 2018.
