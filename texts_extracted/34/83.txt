Always with a view to strengthening our supply chain, we have taken initiatives to create a 
cooperative network with and between key suppliers. On one hand, we aim to increase the 
number of framework contracts, an effective tool that allows the supplier to rise to the level of 
"partner", with which to share objectives, risks and results, thus contributing to their sustainability 
in the medium and long term. 
On the other hand, we encourage the creation of a network and of cooperation between 
suppliers who have been identified as excellent in their field. This allows Elettronica a greater 
guarantee of the supply chain, since suppliers, in their search for sub-suppliers, have the 
possibility of turning to those already approved by Elettronica. The result is a guarantee of results 
and a lower need for control by Elettronica and, at the same time, the opportunity for suppliers 
to establish new relationships with other companies so that they themselves are less dependent 
on Elettronica’s business and therefore - especially for the smaller suppliers - to reduce the risk 
deriving from dependence on a single customer or from limited diversification.

The win-win approach that we pursue in the relationship with our supply chain also presupposes 
the availability of scenario information and the sharing of strategic-technological road-maps to 
guide our suppliers in their research and investment choices. In this direction followed by the 
Technological Coordination Table: a tool for coordination between the internal departments of 
the Company on the opportunities and technological strategies to be pursued and an opportunity 
to share information with suppliers. Thanks to this approach, fair and clear relationships based 
on mutual trust have been built over time with all our suppliers, which look to the future by 
focusing on investments that can create value in the long term
