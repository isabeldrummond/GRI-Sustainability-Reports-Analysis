Our people represent a wealth of skills, values and relationships to which we pay 
attention during the workersâ€™ entire lifetime with the Company, from 
recruitment to the termination of their employment:     they represent the most 
important asset on which the Company's ability to pursue excellence and face 
global market, innovation and, at the same time, sustainable development 
challenges is based.
