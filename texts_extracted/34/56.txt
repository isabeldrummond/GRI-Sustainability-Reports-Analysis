GIVING VALUE TO PEOPLE 
AND SKILLS 
Sharing and involving, keywords to create a work environment in which 
everyone feels in the right place and able to provide the expected 
contribution, are an essential feature of recruitment processes and tools, 
in Elettronica’s management of skills and personnel. 
 
Recruitment Policy 
Entering Elettronica means receiving an imprinting that the new employee will bring with him, in 
emotional and behavioural terms, throughout his career. For this reason the Company has planned 
and developed specific and original paths for inclusion. 
“I-ELT” is an induction training process designed to guide new employees within the organization 
and functioning of the Company, giving them roles and duties of responsibility, stimulating correct 
and effective behaviour from the outset, but also spreading a sense of identity and of belonging. The 
process of integration process starts on their very first day in Elettronica, when they are welcomed 
by the HR department which explains the internal procedures and the regulatory and administrative 
aspects of the employment relationship on what is known as the Welcome Day; it continues with the 
provision of assistance and informative material, and a series of meetings with the managers of each 
Company department and, last but not least, an opportunity to get to know the Director General. The 
integration process ends after about a year. It is followed by a period of assessment to understand 
both the new employee’s degree of satisfaction, and a final evaluation of the entire process by his/her 
direct manager.
