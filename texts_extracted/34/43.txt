 
Internal Rules 
Elettronica has adopted a set of internal rules and procedures in order to 
promote,  also  through  the  traceability  of  documents,  processes  and 
operations,  the  principle  of  effective  accountability  of  the  Company,  the 
integrity and correctness of decision-making processes and compliance with 
sector and general laws.

Decision making rules 
These discipline how business decisions are taken by providing, for a given issue, the intervention 
of all the competent departments that share responsibility for such decisions according to the degree 
of  involvement  and  the  extent  of  the  decision-making  power. The  document flow  traces  the 
competent and responsible subjects of the single steps of the corporate decisions (preparation, 
approval and authorisation). The system is reviewed and updated in accordance with organisational 
changes and/or new business processes. 
A specific aspect of the internal decision-making process is represented by the authorization cycle 
relating to offers, contracts and purchase requests. It provides for a traced authorization process 
based on specific Company powers, in order to increase transparency, reduce margins of error and 
avoid illicit acts and behaviour.    The cycle, compliant with the reference standard EN9100: 2016, 
involves the hierarchical line of those who activate the request and the departments involved, as 
well as the Administration & Control department and, if necessary, the Operational Excellence 
Department. A part of the decision-making process, with importance at managerial level, is the 
General Management Meeting, a structured information sharing system that includes monthly 
meetings (the General Management Meeting - GMM) attended by all the Department Directors.
