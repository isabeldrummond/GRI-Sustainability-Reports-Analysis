OUR MATERIAL ISSUES
The materiality matrix allows us to identify the issues of 
greatest interest to the Company and its stakeholders, 
increasing the ability to create shared value.
In 2019 we adopted the principle of materiality in the social reporting process, a principle 
that allows us to identify the most relevant issues, as those that are capable of reflecting the 
economic, environmental and social impact of the organization and of influencing the decisions 
of the stakeholders. The materiality analysis has allowed us to broaden the field of analysis to 
issues although not previously explored, to assign a priority both to those that are already 
known and have already been reported, and to those newly identification, allowing us take 
a step forward in awareness and knowledge of the effects that the Company generates on 
the economy, society and the environment. The meeting points between the priorities of the 
stakeholders and those of the Company, with regard to the important Social Responsibility 
issues, has given rise to our materiality matrix.
