Today many corporate initiatives pay particular attention to the energy consumption of the 
machines used (servers and PCs) and the consolidation of this action is under way for greater 
IT and energy efficiency. 
Elettronica's Green Data Centre was developed with the aim of ensuring reliability for all IT 
needs and obtaining energy efficiency results. 
In 2018 we promoted and implemented the Photovoltaic initiative for the self-production of 
electricity: on the roofs of the main building and of a building renamed Green Lab, a photovoltaic 
system consisting of 848 panels was installed, with a power of 229 KWp and an energy 
production capacity of 200 MWh per year, leading to a consequent reduction in CO2 emissions 
corresponding to about 70 tons per year. 
Since the day on which the photovoltaic system became fully operational (3 August 2019), 
electricity savings of 91 MWh (equal to € 13,400) have been achieved (in 2019) 
which corresponds to 41,257 kg of CO2 emissions avoided (equal to approximately 137 trees 
planted).  From the  optimization  of the  operation  of  the  system  (by  interpolation),  annual 
electricity savings have been estimated at around 300 MWh/year (equal to € 44 K/year) equal 
to 136,000 Kg of CO2 emissions avoided every year (approximately 454 annual trees planted). 
In 2020, the Company’s cooling system is being rationalised and rendered more efficient. The 
investment which, after a first run-in phase, entered full steam in 2019, generates 6% of the total 
energy requirement, entirely used for business activities. 
For 2020, continuing in the direction of rationalizing and structuring the correct and responsible 
management of energy resources, the construction of a corporate centralized cooling system is 
planned.
