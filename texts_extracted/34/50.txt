THE HEALTH AND SAFETY 
OF PEOPLE 
The health and safety of people and workplaces are issues subject to 
our constant attention and improvement. 
The adoption of an Occupational Health and Safety Management System has 
allowed us to further improve the levels of safety and health in the workplace 
to bring them above the level of regulatory obligations. 
In addition to BS UNI ISO 45001:2018 certification, in 2019 Elettronica decided to adapt the 
system to the new UNI ISO 45001:2018 international standard, in order to guarantee the 
integrated and organic management of safety in all corporate and organizational spheres and 
to pursue continuous improvement in this area. 
 
Coverage of Occupational Health and Safety and of Product Safety 
•  All workers, regardless of their type of contract, including student workers and trainees, are covered by 
the System, as well as consultants and suppliers who operate at the plant or on behalf of Elettronica at 
other sites 
•  The personnel who work on transfer are managed through a Travel Security Management system 
•  All the Company's activities are covered by the System including all those carried out at external 
sites 
•  The H&S function also ensures product safety, also with regard to products purchased and sold, 
involving a careful analysis of compliance with the applicable binding regulations. Procedure P12 
relates precisely to product safety 
 
Risk assessment and accident investigation 
•  The risk assessment is carried out according to the provisions of Legislative Decree 81/08, by suitable 
personnel on the basis of the skills and training required by the law itself. 
•  In risk assessment procedures, the system provides specific forms for reporting as well as the 
possibility of contacting the Prevention and Protection Service Manager (PPSM) 
•  The workers are trained on internal rules in case of emergency (serious and immediate 
danger) and on how to alert rescuers/expert personnel 
•  During the training, they are all informed that they are not required to work in situations of 
serious and immediate danger 
•  All accidents/incidents are analysed by the Prevention and Protection Service (PPS) and 
on removal of the cause further prevention and protection measures are put in place. 
•  At Corporate Risk Management level, the risks (by category) and the related H&S controls 
are identified, as contemplated within the System in use 
 
Workers’ participation and communications 
•  Legislative Decree 81/08 provides for the consultation of the WSR (Workers' Safety Representatives) on 
all SSL issues as well as on access to corporate documents 
•  The WSR are requested to express their opinion on system objectives, performance and audits, in 
accordance with the specific procedures 
•  Formal meetings are held at least once a year on specific issues that come to light 
•  Workers are given training on health and safety in the workplace, in accordance with Legislative Decree 
81/08 and the State/Regions Agreement Act 221/CSR of 21/12/2011, also in order to increase their 
awareness of the risks
