The definition of Elettronica’s values: 
a joint process
Our guiding values have been formalized in our 
Charter of Values.
In 2016, during the annual ELTOGETHER event, 
Elettronica presented the “Vision” and “Mission” 
statements, defined thanks to the collaboration 
with the LUISS Business School, and the “Values” 
statement, thanks to the contribution of the entire 
corporate population, by which the Company’s 
cardinal values were described in a dedicated survey. 
The statements were then ratified in October 2017 
in the Charter of Values approved by the Board of 
Directors, and in the updated Code of Ethics.  The 
project was then illustrated by a special enhancement 
of the Company’s premises (with posters, stickers 
etc.) and by the distribution of personalized gadgets 
to each employee.
