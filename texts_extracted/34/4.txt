To be a company, today more than ever, means awareness of one’s social role, of the 
commitment and the responsibility of re-thinking and constructing a sustainable 
development model.
The economic system in which we operate is increasingly complex and requires an 
integrated approach with the environmental and social dimension that is capable of 
generating lasting, quality growth, thus harmoniously inserting itself into a process of 
continuous change.
Our history represents the creation of an extraordinary patrimony of skills, abilities and 
technologies and is the demonstration of how the legacy of the past can be a great driving 
force for the future. A story built on people, based on their technological, industrial and 
professional know-how, always at the forefront of innovation in a highly competitive sector, 
which has allowed us to face important challenges and changes.
For us, the ability to project ourselves towards the future by enhancing our wealth of skills 
and people, consolidating our potential on a path of growth, means sustainability and the 
creation of long-term value.
We share this ambitious challenge with our stakeholders who strengthen our credibility as 
key partners for innovation, for development and for consolidation in the territories in which 
we operate and for the creation of highly qualified jobs.
Our vision aims to guide our Group’s activities with determination towards a sustainable 
future, starting from the construction of a responsible present.
 
The Chairman Enzo Benigni, D.Eng.
