Environmental 
Management 
 
 
In recent years we have started out on a progressive path to guarantee a sustainable 
production and consumption model.    A path that involves company processes and 
structures, aiming at energy efficiency and the responsible use of natural resources, 
which implies a change of mentality and approach to the consumption of resources, 
starting from individuals and gradually involving the entire organization. 
The Company has a management system regarding environmental issues (waste, 
discharges, emissions, etc ...) and an energy management system to allow the 
rational use of corporate commodities.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND THE 
REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS 
 
We have embarked on a path of energy efficiency for our processes, to reduce 
consumption, energy costs and CO2 emissions. 
 
In 2011 we started a more correct and responsible management of energy resources 
(electricity and natural gas, but also water, liquid nitrogen and technical gases) and in 2018 we 
have also started to install photovoltaic systems for the self-production of electricity.
