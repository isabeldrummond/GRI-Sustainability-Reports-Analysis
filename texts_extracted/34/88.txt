 
Customer satisfaction also involves assessment sessions. We operate in a structured and pro-
active way in the field of Customer Satisfaction, preparing an annual interview plan and sending 
our customers a dedicated questionnaire. It is a rigorous process which has the aim of defining 
action to improve the level of perceived quality, and which progresses throughout the entire life 
cycle of the products and services, with particular attention to: 
 
•  exploring customer needs (Offer phase) 
•  product development, construction and delivery (Project execution) 
•  after-sales (the operational life of the product) 
 
The process is based on Customer Survey questionnaires, to measure customer satisfaction 
with regard for the various business areas involved, and a Survey to measure satisfaction with 
the product supplied. There are several quality factors that contribute to the calculation of the 
customer satisfaction score: 
 
•  Company Image & Communication: the customer’s perception of the Company, as 
expressed by means of the various communication tools and according to the Company's 
ability to transmit its image 
•  Contract Management: compliance with contractual requirements, and the management 
skills and technical knowledge possessed by Company staff who interface with customers 
in the different stages of the process 
•  Product: functionality, usability and degree of reliability; the capacity to efficiently and 
promptly support the product when being used, during the warranty and after-sales phase 
 
The Survey programme is valid for one year. This is the estimated period of time required in 
order to determine, implement and appreciate the effectiveness of improvement action. All the 
information and data collected are then analysed, evaluated and shared with the Company's 
internal managers, in order to identify the improvements still to be made.
