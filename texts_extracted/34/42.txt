RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT 
We have adopted a system of ethical rules, regulations and internal 
management, aimed at guaranteeing correct conduct and at promoting 
accountability, to ensure the achievement of objectives, to minimize the 
organisation’s exposure to risk and to foster continuous improvement. 
 
 
The Code of Ethics 
Elettronica’s Code of Ethics clearly defines the Company’s ethical and 
social responsibilities and those of the people who 
work on its behalf, ensuring fair and effective decisions, action and behaviour.

The Code of Ethics, approved by the  
Company's Board of Directors in 2017,

Attention to sharing a system of ethics and of values as a guide for the Company in its process of 
continuous evolution and development, is a characteristic of the manner in which Elettronica acts, 
which has committed itself to promoting the adoption of the Code of Ethics also by the subsidiaries 
(the CY4GATE Code of Ethics was approved by the Board of Directors on December 6, 2018).
