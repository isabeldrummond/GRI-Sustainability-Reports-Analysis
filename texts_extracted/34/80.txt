 
The questionnaire is not only a way of acquiring information, but it is also an initial stimulus for 
improvement: in the self-assessment phase, in fact, the supplier is encouraged to ask itself 
questions about its own supply chain, its economic-financial and managerial strength and its 
own technical and operational skills, and it is prompted to adapt also through the adoption of 
management systems and related certifications. 
 
Encouragement to adapt towards process/product  2019 data 
standards  
Suppliers registered on the portal who declare that they possess 
certification or systems aimed at managing health and safety at  9%

Suppliers registered on the portal who declare they hold ISO 14001 
10% 
certification for their environmental management system 
Suppliers included on the Suppliers Register Portal who declare

system 
 
In addition to the questionnaire, the qualification process may include, if necessary, an on-site 
assessment and possible follow-up action, or an inspection which may lead to corrective action 
in  the  case  of  any  non-conformities.    Furthermore,  after  accreditation  and  during  the 
performance of services, suppliers are subjected to monitoring and performance assessment 
and on-site meetings and audits relative to the product/process in question, in order to check 
and ensure that the qualification requirements are maintained. 
We also pay great attention to combating counterfeiting; therefore during the qualification 
process, COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) suppliers must accept Terms & Conditions which 
contain a paragraph dedicated to this subject. 
There is a second anti-counterfeiting control when the material is delivered to Company, by 
means of a scrupulous and structured incoming procedure ("entry test").  The last step of the 
accreditation process is the notice sent to the suppliers of the outcome of the pre-qualification 
and qualification activities.
