 
process, from the planning and programming of training activities, too the issue of the training (with 
classroom training, e-learning courses, training pills ...), up to the assessment of the results, the 
certification and the updating of the employee's curriculum vitae. The management of training 
activities is completed by means of the digital Development Module, by which the indications that 
serve to bridge the gaps in technical and/or behavioural skills deriving from the assessment of skills 
are translated into individual development plans. 
In parallel with the implementation of “MyHR”, the “ELT Professional World” tool was created, which 
informs the organization and all possible career paths in Elettronica in gaming mode. This tool offers 
a navigation map of all current positions, complete with the related job descriptions and allows the 
employee to express his/her interest in covering positions. In 2019 the degree of correspondence 
between actual and ideal mobility mapped by the tool was 80%.
