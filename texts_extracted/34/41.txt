 
Elettronica's organizational structure comprises 10 corporate departments, led 
and coordinated by the Director General. 
 
 
The particular type of work performed by the Company - based on programmes - requires, in the 
technical and operational sphere, figures that are involved in all organisational sectors, in order to 
effectively coordinate the activities and ensure the necessary alignment of objectives, times, costs 
and quality among the various programs. It has inter-departmental teams dedicated to “continuous 
improvement” (BELT Shipyards - Building ELT of Tomorrow), comprising people of different levels 
and qualifications, with the aim of examining specific issues from different points of view: this work 
method produces important results and creates synergy between the departments.
