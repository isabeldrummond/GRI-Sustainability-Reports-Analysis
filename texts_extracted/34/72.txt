Electronic defence also for the security of society 
Electronic defence also means security for civil society. In fact, several technological innovations 
developed in Elettronica have a dual use, i.e. they are not designed for exclusive military use. 
An example is the design of a localization and inhibition system for potentially hostile or 
uncooperative drones. In this project we were engaged on the study of the problem of 
identifying, locating and inhibiting drones to protect public places in urban and non-urban 
environments. The aim of the study is to offer a defence capacity against a potential threat of 
terrorist acts, on the occasion of public events and/or for private sites. 
Another example of innovative activities with social consequences is represented by the activity 
undertaken in the context of Cyber-Bullying. In order to create an App for iOS and Android 
devices capable of alerting the parents and guardians of minors of potentially dangerous 
messages received by the minors, a complex classifier of natural language has been created 
using techniques specific to natural language processing and Machine Learning in order to 
automatically classify chats and to generate reliable alarms addressed to parents and guardians.
