 
Benefits 
To improve the corporate environment, to improve the quality of personal life, to increase the 
motivation  and  satisfaction  of  our  people  (workers,  employees,  managers),  we  offer  our 
employees “Enjoy Life Time”, a flexible benefits plan launched in 2014. It is an on-line platform 
where the employee can purchase goods and services for himself and his family, using the 
“electronic purse” made available by the Company.

Looking towards the future, we favour the participation of both managers and employees in the 
supplementary pension system, with the aim of ensuring them a higher pension, by integrating 
that offered by the compulsory social security system. On recruitment, we hold a special meeting 
to explain the benefits of subscribing to Cometa, the National Supplementary Pension Fund for 
workers in the metalworking industry. For executives, after assessing the various opportunities 
of the different pension funds available on the insurance market, we opted for the PreviGen 
Pension Fund - a Supplementary Pension Fund for Employees of Affiliated Companies which 
invests the contribution in policies of the Generali Group, which not only offers yield but also 
bases its investment strategies on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) 
criteria.
