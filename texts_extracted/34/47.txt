Control of the compliance of the Company's Quality Management System is guaranteed by an 
internal auditing activity, carried out by qualified auditors of accredited bodies, subjected to 
continuous training and updating. This also allows the spread throughout the Company of the 
knowledge of the corporate certification standards and increases awareness of how individual 
behaviour influences the conformity of products and services.
