 
The Research and Innovation department 
Elettronica has a Research and Innovation (R&I) department whose mission is to constantly 
monitor the development of corporate innovation, designing, collecting and validating new 
solutions, as well as new models and tools. The ultimate goal of the R&I department is to 
implement  applied  research,  capable  of  conceiving  and  incorporating  new  functions, 
technologies and architectures into products to be offered promptly to the market, to meet the 
needs of current or potential customers. The R&I department has the following responsibilities: 
•  to identify and define highly innovative architectures  
•  to develop new functions and technologies to fill the detected now-how gaps, constructing 
the actual prototype and bringing it to a condition of sufficient development to be checked 
and rendered fit for use within the products 
•  to support the Product Lines in defining the “Product Road maps” by directing them to the 
most innovative solutions on the market 
•  to issue and update the “Technology Plan” to support product developments defined in the 
roadmap and based on the inputs received in the Long-term Plan (LTP) and in the Strategic 
Agenda 
•  to act as an “incubator and developer of innovative ideas” that come from internal or from 
external scouting and in which the Company has decided to invest. 
One of the main R&I activities is the periodic review of the Technology Plan, a document that 
represents the response to the Strategic Agenda, which is to say to the Elettronica’s needs for 
its leadership position on the EW market for the decade in terms of: 
•  Capabilities 
•  Products 
•  Functions 
•  European Defence funded programs 
Since the enabling technologies required to support Elettronica products concern various broad 
spectrum domains (i.e. from software to hardware) it is essential to act in a structured manner 
in order to effectively target resources and energy to a research and development activity that is 
excellent and focused on the real needs of the market and of society today and tomorrow. For 
this  reason  we  have  chosen  to  create  an  organizational  structure,  Technology  Scouting 
Management, led by the Procurement area and supported by R&I, which actively contributes to 
the  development  of  the  Elettronica  technological  plan  through  constant  monitoring  of  the 
technology and product market and interaction between internal and external actors, always 
protagonists of innovation. 
More in general, our innovation process follows the open model of innovation. Therefore ideas 
are generated in several ways: 
•  within the R&I department 
•  within the Company 
•  outside  the  Company  (universities,  design  centres,  suppliers,  European  and  NATO 
collaboration) 
All ideas undergo a funnelling process, in line with what is expressed in the technological plan, 
by means of a push-pull methodology: both the technologies and the market can provide 
guidelines for the development of new products by opening new businesses. 
The open innovation model focused on existing business lines provides for “holes” within the 
funnelling phase from which to create new business opportunities and therefore new markets 
and products, always taking into account the needs of the customers. 
The whole process of the conception and development of the idea and of the consequent 
demonstrator takes place following the Design Thinking model, an alternative way of solving
