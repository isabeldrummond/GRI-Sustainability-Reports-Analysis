COMPANY WELFARE 
 We have launched a series of initiatives to improve employees’ well-being, 
promoting the reconciliation of life-work times, increasing their purchasing 
power, promoting preventive health activities, and offering cultural, recreational 
and sports activities. 
 
Attention to health 
Elettronica has developed a totally free health care plan for all its employees and their families 
(which can also be extended to non-dependent family members for an additional fee that can 
be spent as a welfare credit), supporting and sharing with the representative trade unions the 
principle of “health for all”. 
In 2019, in addition, we also decided to offer new retirees - and therefore after the end of their 
employment relationship - the opportunity to continue a supplementary health insurance, by 
joining Elettronica’s special Health Plan. 
In  addition  to  the  health  insurance  policy  envisaged  by  the  National  Collective  Labour 
Agreement for executives, the Company also plans the integration of the Previdir health 
insurance policy for managerial staff. 
The Wellness Project has been launched which consists of several initiatives aimed at the entire 
corporate population to promote healthy nutrition and health prevention (through physical and 
mental well-being and health control).  The project involves a series of informative initiatives and 
activities  to  introduce  correct  eating  habits:  two  hours  of  workshops  on  healthy  eating, 
“EAT_Educational”, in partnership with the San Donato and Philips Group Foundation, also 
promoting the discounted purchase of B-Well products; the introduction of the “Keep-in-form 
Dish” at the Company's refectory; and awareness days with the presence of a nutritionist and a 
chef from the Foundation. The quality of the service, which also intends to satisfy specific food 
needs, is constantly monitored through monthly audits carried out by an H&S team, supported 
by an expert HACCP consultant, by a member of the representative trade union and by an 
employee chosen from volunteer candidates. In 2019 the refectory was used by 70% of 
employees. The Fluidamente Project, with the distribution to all staff of the Tritan flask (BPA 
free) with the ELT logo and the installation of filtered and chilled network water distributors 
throughout the Company, encourages the sustainable consumption of water. Lastly, with the 
launch of the project, a communication campaign was launched on sustainability issues, with 
the distribution of printed matter and the publication of informative material in digital format on 
the Company Intranet
