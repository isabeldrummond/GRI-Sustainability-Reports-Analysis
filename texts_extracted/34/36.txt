 
This  is  why  Elettronica  immediately  started  a  process  of  involving  its  employees  in  the 
preparation of the Social Report; subsequently it involved suppliers in the process of improving 
social reporting and now plans to expand employee involvement with targeted training and 
active participation in defining the social responsibility behaviour and activities in which the 
Company can and must engage.

OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND 
THEIR INVOLVEMENT 
We have the goal of building, together with our stakeholders, an ecosystem 
aimed  at  common  growth,  based  on  a  profound  sharing  of  values.  We 
consider stakeholder mapping and analysis as a continuously evolving tool. 
Aware of their central importance, in 2016 we have started a process of mapping and analysing 
our stakeholders, involving all the corporate departments involved. In addition, management has 
allowed us to identify their expectations and interests through the channels already used by the 
Company for interaction with the stakeholders for institutional, managerial and commercial 
purposes. A process that led us to undertake, in 2019, the direct involvement of the stakeholders 
in the preparation of the Social Responsibility Report. 
Considering the crucial role of the Suppliers in creating shared value and in the pursuit of 
excellence, it was decided to start this new, important phase with them. Interaction that made it 
possible to move from self-referencing to stakeholder-friendly reporting, through a shared 
process of information building and Social Responsibility actions. 
The direct involvement of suppliers in Social Responsibility is the first step of a stakeholder-
involvement process in which we dedicate time to discussions with our stakeholders in order to 
draw up a shared path of Social Responsibility.
