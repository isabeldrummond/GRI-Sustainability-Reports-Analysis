MOUNTOPIA
DYNAFIT’s Mountopia is a twice a year competition  
that asks hundreds of mountain athletes to push their 
physical limits to win an unforgettable, once in a lifetime 
mountain dream. 
In collaboration with GORE® and PrimaLoft®,  
DYNAFIT offers winners a chance to win a fully-financed, 
multi-day guided mountain excursion – chosen by  
the winner. 
In 2018, two editions of the competition took place. Both 
editions called on 600 passionate athletes to set their limits 
high and share their ‘Mountopia’ – a description of their 
ultimate mountain sports dream. Ten contestants are then 
selected to compete head-to-head.
We selected four athletes for the first edition of 2018.  
They won the chance to live out their dream and climb the
