PROTECTING WILDLIFE
DYNAFIT: Snow Leopard Trust
The snow leopard is DYNAFIT’s brand symbol and 
embodies its values and characteristics – a perfect 
combination of speed, endurance and dynamism. 
Sadly, it’s been in danger of extinction since 1972,   
with an estimated 4,000-6,500 cats remaining 
worldwide. DYNAFIT is helping to prevent the 
extinction of this species. Since 2007, we’ve 
supported the non-profit organisation Snow Leopard 
Trust, which works to protect this endangered cat 
through community-based conservation projects. 
We organise the Snow Leopard Day each year, a public  2018
ski touring event held in several locations worldwide.
