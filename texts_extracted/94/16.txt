OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY 
HOW WE DO THINGS
As a family business, we choose how we do things.  
We're not only interested in quarterly results.  
We think long term. We think about the world  
we’re leaving behind for our grandchildren,  
and their grandchildren. 
Sustainability is a choice we invest in, because we 
believe in it. It’s a crucial part of our company values  
and daily business.  
Back in 2010, we made our commitment to sustainability official
