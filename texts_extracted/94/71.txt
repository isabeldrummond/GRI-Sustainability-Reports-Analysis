RECYCLED WOOL, MADE IN ITALY
One of our bestselling flagship products, Sarner, isn’t just 
100% made in Italy – its wool is also 100% recycled.  
Our partner in Prato, Italy, sorts discarded woollen goods, 
mechanically processes the wool, and transforms it into 
regenerated wool yarn. 
The wool holds the Global Recycled Standard and Cardato 
Recycled certifications, which guarantee recycled content. 
These certifications also guarantee the highest standards 
of respect for the environment – specifically water, energy 
consumption and CO  emissions – and social impact.

Our supplier transforms the recycled wool yarn into high 
quality woollen fabrics. Together we developed these 
fabrics for our SALEWA Sarner jacket. Thanks to  
the success of the product, we’re introducing several  
new styles that feature recycled wool in upcoming  
SALEWA collections.
