What really counts at the end of  
our lives, are the relationships  
with people and how much  
good we could do. 
People are at the centre of what we do.  
But caring for people means we need to take 
responsibility for the environment we all live 
in â€“ more urgently than ever before. I believe 
our immediate duty today is to ensure a fair 
and equal industry, while sustaining a world 
worth living in for generations to come.
