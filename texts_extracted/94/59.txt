CHEMICALS (PFCS)
Perfluorinated Chemicals (PFCs) are a type of chemical  PFCs look like a snake, with a head and a long tail. Different

products to ensure water repellence and permeability. dangerous they are. That’s why we excluded all long-chain 
  PFCs in 2014, as soon as we got to know of their  
negative effect.   
Using PFCs for performance
PFCs guarantee best-in-class performance for technical 
apparel that needs to be both water-repellent and still allow 
humidity to exit. These qualities are crucial for professional 
mountain expeditions – under extreme conditions, it can be the 
difference between life and death. Despite years of industry 
research, there’s still no technology that replicates  
the performance of PFCs.
