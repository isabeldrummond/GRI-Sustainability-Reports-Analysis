SAFETY
It is extremely important to have a solid 
system to ensure product safety and  
supply-chain monitoring in order to protect 
our consumers and the environment.  
One of our top priorities is making sure our 
materials and products are safe for both humans  A product that poses hazards to people or 
the environment is inherently unsustainable, 
and the environment. 
no matter what other sustainable 
characteristics it has.
Along with our in-house chemical management

Our goal is to control the entire lifecycle of 
our products â€“ from raw material, through the 
production process, to the finished product.
