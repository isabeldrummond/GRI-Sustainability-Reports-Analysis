SOME OF OUR SUCCESS  
BEHIND THE SCENES-2018
In China
Work which exceeds legal limits (overtime) is a recurring 
problem in Chinese factories. It may be due to poor 
planning from the factory, or bad timekeeping by  
the brands in defining products and order timelines.  
After many attempts to identify the real causes at one  
of our factories, we decided to carry out a pilot project 
with a comprehensive questionnaire of all the stages 
(from product development to bulk orders) to identify 
how our product management could have an impact on 
overtime. In that way we could adapt our processes to the 
needs of the factory for the following year. We also shared 
the project with other competitor brands sourcing at the 
factory so that it would have a greater impact.
