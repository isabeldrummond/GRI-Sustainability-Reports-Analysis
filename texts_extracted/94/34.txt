OUR  
PRODUCTION
BY VOLUME
We work with the best 
factories, in countries that 
have production expertise. 
In 2018, we worked with 103 
factories across 20 countries.
We were able to concentrate 
our production and reduce 
our factories by 12% between 
2017 and 2018. This makes it 
easier to improve our factory 
standards enabling us to focus 
our sustainability efforts and 
have a higher impact.
