Companies will increasingly be 
measured by the contribution they  
are able to provide to society. 
Sales, profitability, growth and investment will 
continue to be important but the most defining 
measure will be how relevant a company is to the 
community it serves. 
The Oberalp Group is committed to behaving 
and acting mindfully to the best of its ability. 
We do what we do, because we know why we do 
it - and we have clear ideas about how it should 
be done. We talk about it transparently and 
honestly. We say what has been achieved and 
8
1 what still has to be achieved.
