OUR SHOPS
Our shops are a place for us to meet our consumers  
– to empower, engage, and inform. It’s also a place for  
consumers to develop their passion for mountain sports.  
We organise a number of activities at our shops: 
- Running test to try new shoes 
- Excursions and hiking with shop clients
- Photography competition 
- Evenings with brand athletes
- Book presentations (on mountains and outdoors) 
Consumers need to know what’s behind the product  
they buy. It’s our job to communicate this information 
transparently. That’s why we’re focusing on telling them  
more about our sustainability efforts at our shops.
