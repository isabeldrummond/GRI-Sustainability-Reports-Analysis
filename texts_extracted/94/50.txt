We are proud to produce our bindings with 
disabled people nearby our offices in Munich. 
Even though this approach takes more effort 
and time it is motivating for all of us how 
these handicapped people have become a 
crucial part of the DYNAFIT family. 
Between the three groups, we have around

170 disabled workers working on our products

– and, in 2018 we produced around 100,000 
pairs of bindings and 50,000 spare parts with 
the help of these workers.
We’re proud to say that 100% of our 
bindings are assembled by disabled 
workers at these organisations.
