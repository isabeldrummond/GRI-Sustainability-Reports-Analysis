SALEWA: Sherpa Girl
In 2018, we started a new project called Sherpa 
Girl, partnering with a small organisation that 
works to give young Nepalese girls from poor 
families access to education. In Nepal, many girls 
are not allowed to go to school, because their 
poor families need them to work in the household. 
The donations made go directly to the families, 
so that they can afford their girls not working. 
Education is a powerful way to help girls build a 
strong future for themselves and it is also key in 
helping developing economies prosper.
With the help of the local organisation we have 
identified 9 girls living across various small villages 
in the Nepalese mountains.
