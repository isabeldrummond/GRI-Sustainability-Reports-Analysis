Logistics centre
Our central warehouse, opened in 2011 along with 
our offices, is built over four floors and is around 
10,000 m2.  More than 70% of our orders are fulfilled 
through the automatic warehouse system, which 
handles around 30,000 pieces each day. 
The automatic system can’t handle some items  
due to their size (e.g. skis) so they’re dealt with 
by a manual warehouse system.
Sustainability and energy efficiency in  
our logistics centre has been the focus  
since day one.
