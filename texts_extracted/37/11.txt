In performing its sustainability duties, the BoD has been supported, since 2014, by the Sustainability

sustainability. The Committee is an important safeguard of the sustainability matters integrated in the 
company’s business model, for example concerning climate change3 and human rights. Eni’s BoD has 
also appointed an Advisory Board to analyse, for the benefit of the BoD and the CEO, the issues relating 
to the decarbonization process.
