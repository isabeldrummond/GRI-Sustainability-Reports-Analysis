ENI FOR 2019 13
It is necessary to consider that the achievement of the SDGs requires an unprecedented collaboration between the public and the private sec-
tor. Hence Eni’s effort in defining and building alliances (public-private partnerships) with locally rooted, internationally recognised partners.
Moreover, Eni has been confirmed as a participant in the Global Compact LEAD – the largest initiative in the world on business sustainabil-
ity – demonstrating its ongoing commitment in favour of the Principles of the United Nations for Responsible Business. Eni was recognised 
as one of the most active companies: in 2019, it participated in the Action Platform for Reporting on the SDGs and in the Action Platform for 
Financial Innovation for the SDGs.
