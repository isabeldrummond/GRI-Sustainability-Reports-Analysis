SHALL WE ADVISE STRETCHING FORTH THE HAND TO THE SHIPWRECKED 
SAILOR, OR POINTING OUT THE WAY TO THE WANDERER, 
OR SHARING A CRUST WITH THE STARVING?
YES, IF I CAN ONLY TELL YOU FIRST EVERYTHING WHICH OUGHT 
TO BE AFFORDED OR WITHHELD; MEANTIME, I CAN LAY DOWN FOR MANKIND 
A RULE, IN SHORT COMPASS, FOR OUR DUTIES IN HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS: 
ALL THAT YOU BEHOLD, THAT WHICH COMPRISES BOTH GOD AND MAN, 
IS ONE – WE ARE THE PARTS OF ONE GREAT BODY. 
NATURE PRODUCED US RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER, 
SINCE SHE CREATED US FROM THE SAME SOURCE AND TO THE SAME END. 
SHE ENGENDERED IN US MUTUAL AFFECTION, 
AND MADE US PRONE TO FRIENDSHIPS. […]
LET THIS VERSE BE IN YOUR HEART AND ON YOUR LIPS:
“I AM A MAN; AND NOTHING IN MAN’S LOT DO I DEEM FOREIGN TO ME”.
LET US POSSESS THINGS IN COMMON; FOR BIRTH IS OURS IN COMMON. 
OUR RELATIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER ARE LIKE A STONE ARCH, 
WHICH WOULD COLLAPSE IF THE STONES DID NOT MUTUALLY SUPPORT 
EACH OTHER, AND WHICH IS UPHELD IN THIS VERY WAY.
SENECA, LETTERS TO LUCILIUS
