Safety culture
Eni is working hard on constantly spreading a safety culture as an essential part of the activities, 
through projects that promote safety behaviours in all work and, in general, life environments. The goal 
is to motivate to safety so that every person is a safety leader in the performance of his or her job, lead-
ing by example thanks to the management’s commitment.
