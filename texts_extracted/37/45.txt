Human rights training activities

key element of its own commitment in respect for human rights. In continuity with the awareness

employees, to create a shared culture, a common language, and to improve the understanding of 
possible impacts of the business on human rights. In 2019, the human rights training program 
continued both with specific modules and with campaigns accessible via web by all employees 
(Security and Human Rights, Human Rights and relations with Communities, Human Rights in the 
Workplace and Human rights in the Supply Chain). Moreover, in 2019 the new training campaigns 
were started for the entire Eni population: “Sustainability in terms of stakeholders, reporting and 
human rights” and “SDGs”.
Human rights in the workplace: industrial relations
Respecting the rights of the people who work within Eni and for Eni is essential to build mutually 
satisfactory and durable relations. Eni’s Industrial Relations model is based on agreements that 
define the procedures for sharing information with the organisations representing the workers. 
These agreements were defined at the national and international level and among them two are 
European (the European Works Council and the European Observatory for Health, Safety and Envi-
ronment in Eni) and one is global: the Global Framework Agreement (GFA), renewed in June 2019 
at the end of the annual meeting held in Athens. This document, resulting from a collaboration with 
the main Italian unions and with IndustriALL Global Union, encloses a series of commitments to 
comply with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with the Declaration on the elimination of 
all forms of discrimination against women, with the Declaration of the rights of the child, with the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other ILO Conventions directly applicable 
to Eni’s activities, to OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, with the principles of the Glob-
al Compact of the United Nations, with the ILO Declaration on Multinational Enterprises revised 
in 2017 and with UNGPs. By this renewed four-year agreement, Eni and the general secretaries 
13) Salient issues identify the main matters identified in Eni with respect to human rights.
