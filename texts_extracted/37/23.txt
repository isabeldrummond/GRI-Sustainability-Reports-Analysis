22 CARBON NEUTRALITY IN THE LONG TERM    OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE MODEL    ALLIANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
Path to decarbonization
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO ENI?
Eni has defined a short, medium and long term Business Plan that, leveraging on know-how, proprietary tech-
nologies, innovation as well as on the flexibility and resilience of the assets, will allow to exploit new develop-
ment and efficiency opportunities, so has to play a leading role in the energy transition process. Eni dedicates 
an addendum to long term carbon neutrality, prepared according to the recommendations of the Task Force 
on Climate related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), to provide an even clearer and in-depth disclosure.
Policy and other regulatory tools
“Sustainability” policy; Eni’s position on biomasses; Eni’s responsible engagement on climate change in business associations 
which includes Eni’s position on the role of gas, carbon pricing, low carbon technologies, and natural based solutions
Management tools and organisational models
All the company functions contribute in the definition and implementation of the carbon neutrality strategy. In addition, Eni has 
adopted specific structures to facilitate the energy transition path, as: Evaluation for Medium and Long Term Plans Committee, 
chaired by the CEO; Energy Solutions Department for the generation of energy from renewable sources; Research and Development 
Program for Energy Transition; Central organisational function which supervises the preparation and consolidation of the medi-
um-long term plan; Energy management systems in accordance with the ISO 50001 standard
Progress in 2019 vs. 2018 Objectives
• Upstream GHG emission intensity index: -9% vs. 2018   • -43% upstream GHG emission intensity index vs. 2014
(-27% vs. 2014) • Zero process flaring by 2025
• Volumes of hydrocarbons sent to process flaring:  • -80% of upstream fugitive methane emissions by 2025 vs. 2014
 -15% vs. 2018 (-29% vs. 2014) • Carbon efficiency index: average improvement of 2% per year 
• Fugitive methane emissions: -44% vs. 2018   to 2021 vs. 2014
Target achieved (-81% vs. 2014) • Net zero carbon footprint (Scope 1 and 2):
• Carbon efficiency index: -7.4% vs. 2018 -  of upstream activities in 2030
-  of all Group activities in 2040
• Emissions throughout the life cycle at 2050 vs. 2018 (Scope 
1, 2 and Scope 3):
-  -80% of net absolute emissions
-  -55% of net carbon intensity

Governance
CEO and BoD have  Eni’s decarbonization strategy is included in a structured Corporate Governance system in which BoD and 
a central role in the  CEO have a central role. As support, the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee studies in depth, on a 
definition of the  regular basis, the integration between strategy, evolution scenarios and medium-long term business sus-
decarbonization  tainability and the Advisory Board helps to refine Eni’s strategic path. In 2019, the Evaluation for Medium 
strategy and Long Term Plans Committee was established, at the management level, chaired by the CEO with the 
goal of supporting the organic and sustainable development of Eni’s business identifying strategic and op-
