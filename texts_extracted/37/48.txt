In line with the United Nations Guiding Principles for Businesses and Human Rights (UNGPs) and Eni’s  Eni with the 
Statement on Respect for Human Rights, in 2019 Eni in Mexico commissioned the Danish Institute of  Danish Institute

for the implementation of regular social audits, included as such in the Human Rights Action Plan (2019-
2021) in Mexico approved at the end of that year.
Main results
The contractor performance with regards to respect for human rights was considered generally satisfac-
tory. Nevertheless, it was deemed appropriate to implement some actions to consolidate the level of sat-
isfaction guaranteed, as well as to prevent the possible occurrence of problems in the future, concerning 
the following observations: 
• some workers did not know about the presence of unions and some did not understand the princi-
ples and functions of unions even if they belong to one;
• differences between the Federal Labor Work and internal labor regulations in relation to the min-
imum age for work. However, through an employee registry analysis, it was detected that there 
were no underage workers employed at the site;
• the contractor did not have a grievance mechanism in place specifically for the workers, express-
ing however his willingness to establish its own grievance mechanism;
• there was no evidence of social responsibility reports, even when this element was part of con-
tractor’s internal policy; 
• female staff did not have exclusive and dedicated restrooms;
• workers did not have an adequate lunchroom. 
Among the good practices identified were: respect for work schedules and, according to the women inter-
viewed, a workplace perceived as a place free from harassment.
Follow up: corrective and preventive actions
The contractor sent some evidences of the measures that they had implemented to attend the observa-
tions made during the social audit. These evidences are related to: i) the modifications to internal labor 
regulations for the correction of differences with the Federal Labor Work; ii) the implementation of griev-
ance mechanism for workers; iii) the preparation of a Corporate Social Responsibility Report by 2019; iv) 
the enablement of female restrooms; v) access to an adequate lunchroom for workers.
