ENI FOR 2019 27
to date. This work, as usual, was integrated with the development of performance assessment process-
es and feedback useful to orient Eni’s resources towards a refreshment of their competencies, accord-
ing to a “continuous improvement” logic. In 2019 the performance assessment process covered 93% of 
the target population in the world (senior, middle managers and young graduates). The need to operate 
in a scenario with marked discontinuity drove Eni to adopt an integrated and flexible organization, able 
to exploit the opportunities that derive from new digital solutions identified also thanks to a working 
group; this group aimed to define the impacts of Digital Transformation on the processes and on the or-
ganization and to identify new profiles and new competencies needed (e.g. forestry, circular economy, 
agile, data science). In parallel, the following initiatives were promoted: upskilling initiatives, through ad 
hoc training, also organized in collaboration with the academic world, change management initiatives, 
useful to drive change management and the participation in working groups organised by international 
bodies, both specific for the energy sector and cross-sectorial (e.g. with the World Economic Forum, the 
MIP of Politecnico of Milan, etc.).

The culture of plurality provides the levers to manage complexity, starting from listening to Eni’s own 
people. An extensive internal communication strategy, in addition to carrying inclusion messages and 
stimulating the contribution of every Eni person, facilitated broad participation in the survey.
