ENI FOR 2019 17
Stakeholder engagement activities
To Eni, the relationship with its stakeholders, listening and sharing decisions with people in the Countries where it operates are fundamental 
elements: knowledge of their point of view and their expectations is the foundation of its commitment to building transparent and lasting 
relationships based on mutual trust. Eni has operations in 66 Countries with very different social, economic and cultural contexts, and it be-
lieves that dialogue and the direct involvement of stakeholders are fundamental elements for creating value in the long term, in every phase 
of its business activities. In order to engage in this daily and proactive dialogue with multiple stakeholders at local, national and international 
level, since 2018, Eni has been using an IT platform called Stakeholder Management System (SMS), which supports the management of its 
complex network of relationships. The system is in use in 37 Countries and tracks over 3,500 stakeholders. The SMS allows to record and 
view relationships with each stakeholder category, highlighting any critical issues and areas for improvement, the main issues of interest, 
the potential impacts on human rights, also identifying the possible presence of vulnerable groups and areas listed by UNESCO as well as 
sites of cultural and/or naturalistic interest (WHS - World Heritage Sites) in the Countries where it operates. For the main issues emerging 
from the dialogue with the following categories of stakeholders, see p. 15.
