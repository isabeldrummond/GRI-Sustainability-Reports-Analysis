of e-vpms® (Eni Vibroacustic Pipeline Monitoring System) and other initiatives of recent years have 
allowed to eliminate trespassing and reduce operational events; for two Italian pipelines, testing con-
tinues on the TPI (Third Party Intrusion) system to detect activities near pipelines (such as excava-
tion work or vehicular traffic) and to allow to prevent the sabotage activities.

OIL SPILLS IN NIGERIA
OILS SPILLS DUE TO SABOTAGE
(Including theft) In recent years, Eni facilities in Nigeria (wells, flow lines and pipelines covering approximately 3,000 km) 
were the targets of illegal activities leading to significant losses. In 2019, for example, compared to the 
158 143 102 98 138
previous year, an increase in the number of oil spills occurred, highlighting that well over 90% of the spills 
41
- % were caused by sabotage events. Presumably the cause of this increase is attributable to social tensions 
vs. 2015
and the climate of greater insecurity during the 2019 election period. In response, Eni developed an inte-
