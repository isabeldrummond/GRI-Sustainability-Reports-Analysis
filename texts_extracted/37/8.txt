Energy demand will have to be met, limiting atmospheric emissions of climate-altering gases to 
combat climate change. The ongoing global warming phenomenon is estimated to have reached 
a level of approximately 1 °C over the pre-industrial era. Currently, approximately 2/3 of global 
greenhouse gas emissions originate from the energy sector; of these, approximately 55% is related 
to the combustion of oil and gas, with coal covering the remainder. According to the IEA, a trajecto-
ry compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement requires halving the emissions of the energy 
sector by 2040, to reach a value of approximately 1/3 of the current one in 2050 and ultimately 
zeroing net emissions in 2070.

precedented economic measures taken by Governments throughout the world.
Though the energy sector needs to address the challenges connected with declining consumption, decrea-
sing commodity prices and with the weakening of the general context in which it operates, it will have to en-
sure continuity to its highly strategic business, while providing the highest safety standards, and ensure the 
fulfillment of its decarbonization commitments, seizing the opportunities arising from the energy transition.
