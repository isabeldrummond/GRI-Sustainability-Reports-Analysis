In 2016, the production of urban solid waste on a global scale reached 2.01 billion tonnes. In Sub-Saharan African Countries, the daily 
production of waste per capita can drop even below 0.1 kg, while it reaches an average of 2.2 kg in OECD Countries which, overall, are 
responsible for 44% of production of waste globally. The trend of increasing waste globally is also related to the increase in population and 
growing urbanization, so it is estimated that the annual production of waste can increase by 70% in 2050 compared to 2016, reaching 3.40 
billion tonnes.
