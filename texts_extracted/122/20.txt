SUSTAINABILITY REPORT - SOL GROUP 19
GENERATED AND 
DISTRIBUTED VALUE
—
The direct economic value generated and distributed, ex-
pressed as the economic increase produced by the SOL 
Group's activities and distributed to the main categories of 
stakeholders, allows the Sustainability Report to be connect-
ed to the financial statements.
In 2019, the economic value generated for stakeholders was 
406 million Euro, an increase of 37 million Euro compared 
to 2018 (+10%). This amount was then distributed to stake-
holders as employee wages (human resources), returns on 
loans granted (lenders), return on risk capital (shareholders), 
taxes (state and institutions) and amortisation and non-dis-
tributed profits (company system).
