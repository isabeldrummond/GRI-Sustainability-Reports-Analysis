A NEW GENETIC TEST 
FOR AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS
â€”
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) include 
a  series  of  early  onset  neuro-develop-
mental disorders characterised by impaired 
social skills, such as learning to play with 
others, communication problems and repeti-
tive behaviours. ASD is a common condition 
(1 in 150), is usually diagnosed between two 
and four years of age and seems to affect 
more males than females (4:1). Scientific 
studies show a general increase in the dia-
gnoses of autism and related syndromes, 
which have more than doubled in the last 
decade.
The cause of the onset of ASD is not yet 
known, although current estimates attribute 
equal weight to genetic and environmen-
tal  factors.  Genetic  factors  may  involve 
both  new  mutations,  i.e.  mutations  that 
have arisen in the affected subject but are 
absent in the parents, and inherited muta-
tions. Genetic investigations in families with 
at least two members with this condition
