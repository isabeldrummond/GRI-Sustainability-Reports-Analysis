energy vectors. (MWh)
The Group's most significant environmental impact is the 
564,355 567,471 575,000
electricity consumption in its primary production plants. In 
fact, both the compression of gases and their liquefaction 
537,437 550,000
are highly energy-intensive operations: it is estimated that 
523,363
this consumption represents about 90% of the consumption 
525,000
of the whole Group. In contrast, the methane and steam

consumption in primary production plants and the electri-

city consumption in secondary production plants and offices 
are considered negligible.

In light of its highly energy-intensive activities, since 2002 
the Group has invested in the production of energy from  450,000

around 31 MW. The electricity produced and sold on the grid 
in 2019 was equal to 90 GWh, corresponding to 15% of the 
Group's energy consumption.
The actions to reduce energy consumption include care in

In particular, the increase in consumption in 2019 is due to 
an increase in production compared to a slight improvement

in the efficiency index because better performing plants 
were in operation.
