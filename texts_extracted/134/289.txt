•  €13.5 million due from the Romanian Ministry for Infrastructure and Transportation related to the surety 
enforced in 2017 as a result of the disputes with the customer about the Orastie-Sibiu motorway contract. 
The Group is confident that it will recover this amount, based also on the opinion of its legal advisors 
assisting it with the disputes. The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report 
provides more information;  
The other financial assets of €95.7 million include: 
• securities of €84.6 million related to the bonds issued by Astaldi and subscribed by Beyond S.r.l., a newco set 
up in 2019 as part of Progetto Italia, maturing on 12 February 2022; they were pledged to secure the financing 
granted to Beyond S.r.l. by a bank syndicate (see note 23). More information is available in the “Progetto Italia” 
paragraph of the “Key events of the year” section; 
• unlisted guaranteed-return securities which mature after one year, amount to €11.0 million and relate to the 
fund financing Yuma. The Group tested its investment in the Colombian operator for impairment in 2019 
assisted by an independent expert using its 2020-2031 business plan. In order to determine its recoverable 
amount, it discounted the cash flows using a cost of equity of 9.6%. The results showed that the recoverable 
amount is higher than the carrying amount and therefore there was no need to recognise an impairment loss. 
More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report.
