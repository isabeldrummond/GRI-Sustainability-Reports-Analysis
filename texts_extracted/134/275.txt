The €104.2 million increase in equity investments is chiefly a result of the following factors:  
-  the increase in the Grupo Unidos por el Canal investment, mainly due to injections and payments made on 
its behalf of €135.3 million; 
-  the increase in Lane Industries’ equity investments due to capital transactions of €10.0 million;  
-  the coverage of the losses of the Ferroviario Milanese consortium by Imprepar S.p.A. for €14.2 million. 
The overall effect on profit or loss is analysed in note 37 and includes the changes in the provision for risks on 
equity investments set out in note 28.  
Dividends from equity-accounted investees mainly refer to the Argentine operators and the non-consolidated 
joint ventures of Lane Group. 
Impairment of equity investments 
The assessments underlying the impairment tests were performed in line with previous years, considering:  
▪  internal procedures;  
▪  IAS 36;  
▪  the guidance and recommendations of the main market regulators. 
The Group used the actual and forward-looking financial data prepared by the investees' management to:  
▪  identify the trigger events (as per IAS 36), such as the distribution of dividends, the actual and expected 
contract outcome on a "whole lifecycle" basis and any negative difference between the carrying amount 
of the equity investment and the Group's share of the investee's equity; 
▪  perform valuations with external experts to obtain adequate technical and methodological support once 
the impairment test process and items to be tested had been approved. 
▪  check that no equity investments had been recognised with a carrying amount higher than their amount 
recoverable through their use or sale.
