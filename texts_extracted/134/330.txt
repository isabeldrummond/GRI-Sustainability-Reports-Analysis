 “State bodies” (€33.3 million) entirely relate to the transactions with the commissioner, the provincial authorities 
and municipalities of Campania in connection with the USW Campania projects. As a result of changes in the 
legal proceedings during the year, the Group reclassified €82.3 million to trade receivables and specifically €59.7 
million to “Third parties” and the remainder to “Other” under other current assets, based on the above legal 
situation. Reference should be made to the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report 
for more information about the complicated situation surrounding the USW Campania projects. 
“Other liabilities” of €158.2 million (€73.2 million) increased by roughly €84.9 million, mostly in relation to the 
acquisition of Cossi Group in March 2019 and the higher liabilities for the high speed/capacity Milan - Genoa 
railway line section contract and the Riachuelo environmental restoration contract in the Buenos Aires area for 
normal contract activities. At the reporting date, the item mainly refers to the consolidation of Cossi Group (see 
note 19 “Other current assets”), the high speed/high capacity projects, Lane’s American projects and some 
foreign projects in Argentina, Venezuela and France. 
Amounts due to employees and social security institutions relate to accrued unpaid remuneration.  
“Unconsolidated group companies and other related parties” amount to €23.4 million and increased by €3.5 
million. The year-end balance and changes in the item principally refer to the Argentine group companies 
involved in the environmental remediation project in the Buenos Aires province and the Churchill Hospital joint 
venture active in the UK hospital sector.   
Accrued expenses and deferred income decreased by €1.4 million to €17.4 million, mainly attributable to the 
works for the Koysha Dam in Ethiopia and Lane Group’s projects as shown in the following table:
