 
-  the increase in lease liabilities of €81.9 million, mostly as a result of the application of IFRS 16 from 1 
January 2019;  
-  payments of taxes and interest of €32.5 million to settle the Ethiopian branch’s tax assessment. 
The debt/equity ratio (based on the net financial indebtedness from continuing operations) is 0.42 at group 
level at the reporting date. 
Salini Impregilo has given guarantees of €166.9 million in favour of unconsolidated group companies securing 
bank loans. 
Gross indebtedness of €2,270.1 million at the reporting date is roughly €68.4 million lower than that at 31 
December 2018. Net of the debt of approximately €85.1 million of Beyond S.r.l. (set up in 2019 as part of Progetto 
Italia), gross indebtedness would be €2,185.0 million which, compared to the balance at 31 December 2018, 
including the FTA of IFRS 1612 (€2,420.5 million), is an improvement of about €235.5 million on the previous 
year end. 
 
12As the Group elected to use the modified retrospective approach (i.e., recognising the cumulative effect of FTA by adjusting the opening 
retained earnings at 1 January 2019), it also adjusted the figures as at 31 December 2018, using the best estimates available, to reflect the 
adoption of IFRS 16 retrospectively. The figures have been adjusted on the basis of the following: 
▪  leases include those in place at 31 December 2018 and, therefore, they do not include those of Lane’s Plants & Paving Division 
sold at the end of that year; 
▪  the IFRS 16 FTA effects on profit or loss have been estimated by anticipating the date of initial application from 1 January 2019 
to 1 January 2018 or an interim date if the lease was agreed in 2018; 
▪  the discount rates at 1 January 2019 have been used.
