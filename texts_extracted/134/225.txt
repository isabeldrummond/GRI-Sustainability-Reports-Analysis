Adoption of the above standards applicable since 1 January 2019 has not significantly affected the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements, except for IFRS 16 and IFRIC 23. 
The IASB issued IFRS 16 in January 2016. It introduced a single method to account for leases in the financial 
statements of the lessee, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases, so that the lessee 
recognises an asset for the right to use an underlying asset and a lease liability. The standard includes 
exemptions when the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. 
IFRS 16 has replaced IAS 17 - Leases, IFRIC 4 - Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC 
15 - Operating leases - Incentives and SIC 27 - Evaluating the substance of transactions in the legal form of a 
lease. 
The Group has applied IFRS 16 retrospectively by recognising the cumulative effect of the FTA in retained 
earnings at 1 January 2019 (the date of transition). Therefore, it has not restated the comparative figures at 31 
December 2018 which are presented in accordance with IAS 17 and related interpretations. Details of the 
changes introduced by the new standard are provided below. 
The Group has elected to use the following practical expedients to restate the opening balances:
