and the workshops.  
Waste materials are collected and sorted, and stored in specific enclosed areas, from which they are then taken 
to be transferred to third parties authorised to recycle/dispose of the waste, preferring recovery where possible. 
Hazardous waste is a marginal part of the waste generated in the Group’s contracts. Normally it involves paint, 
additives and solvents, used oil and oil filters from vehicle maintenance, batteries, rechargeable batteries and, 
in some cases, earth, sludge and other materials containing hazardous substances.  
Waste produced by activity, type and destination, dealt with in accordance with local regulations, is shown in the 
following table:

94% of the waste produced is from excavations. It is classified as waste in line with the applicable regulations 
and its possible internal and/or external reuse, which varies depending on the projects’ characteristics and the 
material’s geotechnical characteristics which the Group cannot influence.  
The decrease in total waste in 2019 is mainly due to the progress made on the projects of Salini Polska (Poland) 
and the Riyadh Metro (Saudi Arabia). 
The percentage of waste recovered, re-used and recycled increased by 17% on 2018 while the total waste 
produced decreased.  
Atmosphere 
Unlike other industrial sectors, the construction sector does not generate significant atmospheric pollution. The 
main sources of atmospheric emissions are linked to dust created by the construction activities: excavations, 
earthwork, movement of heavy vehicles on unpaved roads and crushing excavated stone.
