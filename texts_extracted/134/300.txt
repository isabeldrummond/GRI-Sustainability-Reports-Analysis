•  €71 million mostly due from the former consortium member to the Cossi LGV consortium related to

consortium member recognised under other liabilities against this receivable; 
•  €47.6 million from the public bodies involved in managing the waste emergency in Campania to Fibe. 
The €23.8 million decrease in this item is due to changes in the legal proceedings during the year after 
which the Group reclassified amounts due from public bodies to other current liabilities given the above

known in the near future. This classification is the best estimate, based also on the assessments 
provided  by  independent  experts.  The  section  on  the  “USW  Campania  projects”  and  related 
assessments in the section of the Directors’ report on the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” provides 
more information about these projects;
