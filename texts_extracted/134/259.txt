The increase in the Salini Impregilo Group entities’ ideal interests in the contract (held by COCIV) resulting from 
the reallocation of Condotte’s interest led to a rise in the carrying amount of contract assets relating to the COCIV 
contract of €107.5 million recognised as revenue from contracts with customers in profit or loss in accordance 
with IFRS 15 as the conditions for contract variations and variable considerations are met

Acquisition of Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. 
The Group signed the agreement for the acquisition of Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. on 29 March 2019 (more 
information is available in the “Progetto Italia” paragraph of the “Key events of the year” section in the Directors’ 
report). It initially provided that the investee’s share capital of €10,000,000, comprising 10,000,000 shares, would 
be held by Salini Impregilo S.p.A. (80% for 8,000,000 shares) and Banca Popolare di Sondrio Soc. Coop. P.A. 
(2,000,000 shares).   
The transaction price was €534, including €500 to Società Italiana Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A. and €34 to Ferfina 
S.p.A. for their investments. As provided for in the agreements with Società Italiana Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A., 
the parent took over its liability with Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. as per article 1273.1 of the Italian Civil Code by 
signing sales contracts for assets on 29 March 2019, solely for the part attributable to the seller (€4,601,583). 
The acquisition agreement also included put and call options for the non-controlling interests to be exercised in 
2022 and/or 2024. Salini Impregilo measured these options’ fair value using the forecast data of the subsidiary, 
which is still undergoing a reorganisation at the date of preparation of this report. Based on this measurement, 
performed with the assistance of the parent’s consultants, recognition of a contingent consideration at the 
reporting date was not necessary. 
On 8 April 2019, in their extraordinary meeting, the shareholders of Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. approved a capital 
increase of €2,598,426 (without a premium) to take place through the issue of 2,598,426 shares. The 
shareholder Salini Impregilo S.p.A. waived its right and Banca Popolare di Sondrio Soc. Coop. P.A. subscribed 
the entire increase. Subsequently, the bank sold 2,299,213 Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. shares to Liri S.r.l..  
As a result, Salini Impregilo S.p.A. controls Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. with a 63.5% stake. The two non-controlling 
investors are Banca Popolare di Sondrio Soc. Coop. P.A. and Liri S.r.l. with 18.25% each.  
Salini Impregilo availed of the option allowed by IFRS 3 (revised) to provisionally allocate the transaction cost 
to the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.
