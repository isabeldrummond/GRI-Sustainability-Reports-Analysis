The Group has been active in Australia since 2013 and currently operates through Salini Impregilo Australia 
Branch, the wholly-owned Salini Australia Pty Ltd, Impregilo Salini Joint Venture, Salini Impregilo - NRW JV for 
the performance of the Forrestfield Airport link and SLC Snowy Hydro Joint Venture for the civil works and 
electromechanical component of the contract for the Snowy 2.0 project. 
 
Outlook for 2020 
The Group deems that the Australian market is fundamental for its growth strategy and has presented bids for 
several potential contracts which are worth over AUSD10 billion.

Snowy Hydro 2.0                                                
On 4 April 2019, as leader of the joint venture (65% stake) with the Australian partner Clough (35%), the Group 
won the contract for the civil works and electromechanical component of the Snowy 2.0 project.  
The project provides for the development of another network of hydro power stations in the Snowy Mountains 
Hydro-electric Scheme, helping underpin Australiaâ€™s renewable energy future. 
It involves the construction of a 36 km tunnel to connect the two existing reservoirs Tantagara and Talbingo and 
an underground power station with pumping capacity. The project will increase the renewable generating 
capacity of the existing system by 2,000 MW and serve up to 500 thousand additional houses at times of peak 
demand, with autonomy of 175 hours of continuous large-scale storage.  
The project is worth AUD5.3 billion.
