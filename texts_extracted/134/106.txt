 
Analyses of the electrical and energy performances at the COCIV site in Italy, which is the second to have this 
system, were also started in 2019. 
In Tajikistan, the  Company has developed an  innovative technique for  the  automated transportation  of 
construction materials using high capacity conveyer belts, again for energy efficiency purposes. These belts can 
transport up to 5,500 tonnes of material an hour, improving the production output and avoiding their usual 
transportation by truck. This has generated large financial and environmental benefits. In 2019 alone, the 
estimated benefits in terms of decreased transport-caused emissions are more than 11,300 tonnes of CO   
2.
In addition to continuing its ongoing projects, the Company constantly scouts for new potential innovation, 
research and development projects to invest in. At year end, it had identified projects to be carried out in the 
three-year 2020-2022 period for an investment in excess of €15 million. Their key objective is to design and roll 
out an innovative platform, which integrates new technologies to be used in advanced production processes in 
the construction sector. The end purpose is to encourage a new approach to the Company’s operations strongly 
orientated towards digital technologies to improve efficiency and sustainability.
