•  €35.8 million due from some of the Group’s partners of joint ventures around the world, mainly for the 
works for the housing project in South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait). 
Advances to suppliers increased by €27.8 million. This increase is mainly due to the advances made during 
the year, mostly for the high speed Milan - Genoa contracts, the contract to build the hospital in Turkey and a 
housing and urbanisation project commissioned by Saudi Arabia National Guard (SANG Villas). The item was 
partly offset by the absorption of advances made in previous years for the projects in Qatar, the project to build 
a section of a transit way across two islands in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and works in Colombia. 
At year end, the largest advances paid to suppliers were mainly for the high speed/high capacity Milan - Genoa 
railway line section (€124.5 million), the contract in Saudi Arabia (€51.5 million), the works in Turkey (€34.5 
million) and the projects in Qatar (€26.6 million). 
The item “Unconsolidated group companies and other related parties” increased by €9.1 million to €31.3 million 
at the reporting date, mainly as a result of the rise in amounts due from the Hirpinia A.V. consortium for the 
Apice – Hirpinia section of the high speed Naples - Bari railway line section 
Prepayments and accrued income of €114.7 million show an increase of €14.2 million on 31 December 2018. 
The item mainly consists of insurance premiums, commissions on sureties and other contract costs which will 
be recognised in profit or loss in future periods based on the stage of completion of the related contracts. The 
increase, shown in the following table, is mainly due to the high speed/capacity Milan - Genoa railway line 
section contract, following commencement of Lot 5.
