 
November 2014, in which they stated that the administration had already collected directly €46,363,800 of the 
fee due to Fibe for its services rendered until 15 December 2015 (when the contracts were terminated ope legis), 
without forwarding it to Fibe, and that total outstanding receivables totalled €74,317,550.  
In its ruling no. 7323/2016, the Regional Administrative Court decided that the special commissioner should pay 
the amounts claimed by Fibe only after the assessment is completed and, hence, including amounts already 
collected by the administration. Fibe challenged this ruling with the Council of State which rejected it with its 
ruling no. 1759/2018. A petition for the conclusion of the proceedings was then filed. After the resignation of the 
special commissioner, the Regional Administrative Court appointed a new commissioner on 16 April 2018.   As 
this commissioner did not accept the position, on 10 January 2019, another commissioner was appointed that 
filed a report on 13 January 2020 confirming the findings reported by the previous commissioner in November 
2014. Due to the interim payments made which reduced the total amounts due, the commissioner calculated 
the amounts outstanding as fees to be €54,841,596 and deferred the definitive calculation of the amounts of 
€3,146,373 in addition to that already ascertained and the total amount of interest and fines due to Fibe to a 
second stage.       
As early as 2009, Fibe filed a complaint with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court about the slackness of the 
competent authorities in completing the administrative procedures for the recording and recognition of the costs 
incurred by the former service contractors for activities carried out pursuant to law and the work ordered by the 
administration and performed by the companies during the years from 2006 to 2008 (i.e., after the contracts had 
been terminated).   
As part of the aforementioned ruling, the Regional Administrative Court appointed an inspector who, on 21 
December 2017, submitted a final report finding that, in short, the amounts stated by Fibe in its appeal and the 
supporting documentation were substantially consistent. The company requested a more in-depth review of 
certain items and the correction of some errors. The Regional Administrative Court ordered an additional 
inspection. On 28 September 2018, the inspector filed their final report, which addressed the requests made by 
Fibe for a more in-depth review and corrections. The Lazio Regional Administrative Court with its ruling of 21 
March 2019 ordered the Office of the Prime Minister to pay €52,955,353, including VAT and interest, as the fee 
for services carried out after the contracts were terminated. The Office of the Prime Minister challenged this 
ruling before the Council of State. In its ruling no. 974 of 7 February 2020, the Council of State identified a logical 
legal error in the Regional Administrative Court’s ruling were it ordered the Office of the Prime Minister to pay 
the amounts requested and documented by Fibe (private part) not yet checked by it. The Council of State 
amended in part the first level ruling finding that Fibe is due the smaller amount of €20,962,224.45, increased 
by legal interest (instead of the amount of €52,935,352.80 ordered by the Regional Administrative Court).   
With ruling no. 3886/2011, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court upheld Fibe’s appeal and ordered the 
administration to pay the undepreciated costs at the termination date for the RDF plants to Fibe, for a total 
amount of €205 million, plus legal and default interest from 15 December 2005 until settlement. 
Following the enforcement order filed by Fibe and opposed by the Office of the Prime Minister, Fibe obtained 
the allocation of €241 million (collected in previous years) as a final payment for the receivables for principal 
and legal interest and suspended the enforcement procedure for the further amount of default interest claimed.
