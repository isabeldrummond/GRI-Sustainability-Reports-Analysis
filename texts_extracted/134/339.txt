This analysis excludes the effects of the translation of the equity of group entities with a currency other than the 
Euro. 
Interest rate risk 
Considering the Group’s predominantly fixed rate debt structure in 2019, had interest rates increased or 
decreased by an average 75 basis points in 2019, the profit before tax would have been respectively smaller 
or greater by a maximum of €6.2 million (2018: €5.7 million), assuming that all other variables remained 
constant and without considering cash and cash equivalents.    
Credit risk 
Credit risk is that deriving from the Group’s exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ (which are 
mostly governments or state bodies) non-compliance with their obligations.  
Management of this risk is complex, starting as early as the assessment of offers, through a careful analysis 
of the characteristics of the countries in which the Group’s activities should be carried out and the customers, 
which are usually state or similar bodies, requesting an offer.  
Therefore, this risk can be essentially assimilated to the country risk. An analysis of this risk based on the age 
of the outstanding amounts is not very meaningful, since the receivables should be assessed together with the 
related working capital items, especially those reflecting the net  exposure to customers (contract assets and 
liabilities) in relation to contract work in progress as a whole. 
A breakdown of working capital by geographical segment is set out below:
