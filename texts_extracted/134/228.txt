Lease liabilities presented in the above statement of financial position at the date of initial application amount to 
€81.9 million. Commitments arising from operating leases presented under IAS 17 at 31 December 2018, 
discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application, amounted to €91.8 million. The 
decrease is mostly due to the better estimate made of the lease term and the application of the practical 
expedients for short-term leases (less than 12 months) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. 
IFRIC 23 provides guidance on the determination of taxable profit where there is uncertainty over income tax 
treatments. The interpretation establishes that if it is not probable that a particular tax treatment will be accepted 
by the tax authority, the entity shall reflect this uncertainty in its financial statements. Accordingly, based on past 
experience of tax assessments performed by the Ethiopian tax authorities, the Group recognised a higher tax 
liability of €8 million compared to 2017 and 2018 as these years are still open to assessment. The interpretation's 
transition provisions allow this effect to be recognised under retained earnings at 1 January 2019 and the 
comparative figures do not have to be restated. 
The following table shows the effects of the application of the above standard and interpretation:
