27. Post-employment benefits and employee benefits 
At 31 December 2019, the Group’s liability due to its employees determined using the criteria set out in IAS 19 
is €61.9 million. 
The liability for post-employment benefits is the outstanding amount at the reform effective date, net of benefits 
paid up to the reporting date. The liability is considered part of a defined benefit plan under IAS 19 and has, 
therefore, been subjected to actuarial valuation. The valuation, performed with the assistance of an independent 
expert, was based on the following rates: 
−  turnover rate: 7.25%; 
−  advance payment rate: 3%; 
−  inflation rate: 1.2%. 
The Group has used the Eurocomposite AA index, which has an average financial duration in line with the fund 
being valued, to calculate the discount rate.  
The balance mainly consists of the liability for Lane Group’s defined benefit plan for its full-time employees. This 
liability is calculated on the basis of the employees’ years of service and remuneration and is subjected to an 
actuarial valuation. Lane Group also provides healthcare cover to retired employees, hired before 31 December 
1992 with at least 20 years of service. 
The item also includes the Italian post-employment benefits (TFR) related to Salini Impregilo and its Italian 
subsidiaries. The liability is the outstanding amount at the reform effective date, net of benefits paid up to the 
reporting dates. The liability is considered part of a defined benefit plan under IAS 19 and has, therefore, been 
subjected to actuarial valuation.
