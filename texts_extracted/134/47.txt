Macroeconomic scenario 
Based on the IMF’s most recent projections of January 2020, global growth is 2.9% in 2019, a slight reduction 
on the 3.6% recorded in 2018.  
The main reasons for the slower growth seen since the second half of 2018 include the US economy’s return to 
a more normal expansionary pace, trade policy uncertainty, weak industrial production in Europe as a result of 
a contraction in foreign demand, especially from the emerging Asian economies, geopolitical tensions and 
idiosyncratic stress in key emerging market economies including Mexico, India and Russia, intensifying social 
unrest in several countries and finally the weather-related disasters, from hurricanes in the Caribbean, to drought 
and bushfires in Australia, floods in eastern Africa and drought in southern Africa.

In January 2020, the IMF expected economic growth of 3.3% and 3.4% for 2020 and 2021, respectively. 
Following the recent developments due to the spreading of the Coronavirus, COVID-19, and its effect on the 
economy, the IMF has revised its global growth forecast downwards by 0.1% to 3.2% in its press release of 22 
February 2020. This impact has been estimated assuming that Chinese economic growth will return to normal 
in the second half of the year. 
At the date of this report, updates about the global GDP’s estimated trend, reflecting the spreading of COVID-
19 in countries other than China, are not available. 
With respect to the Group’s reference sectors, according to the IHS Markit January 2020 report, global 
infrastructure investments increased by 2.9% in 2019.
