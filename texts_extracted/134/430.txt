 
In 2018, the company adopted IFRS 15, which introduced new guidance for the recognition of contract costs 
with the recognition of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs to fulfil the contract under 
assets. These costs are amortised in line with the percentage of completion of the related contracts.

stakes in projects/contracts representing intangible assets with a finite useful life, which are amortised in line 
with the stage of completion of the related contracts.
