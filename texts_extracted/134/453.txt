 
Bank corporate loans amount to €648.5 million at the reporting date compared to €685.6 million at 31 December 
2018.  
The decrease in corporate loans during the year is mostly due to repayment of the loan from Banca Popolare 
di Bergamo (€40.3 million at 31 December 2018) partly offset by the increase in the use of revolving credit 
facilities provided by banks.  
The contractual terms of loan agreements with the major banks were modified as part of Progetto Italia with 
repayment of the last instalments in 2025.
