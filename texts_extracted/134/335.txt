 
1) Assessment notice for 2003 IREPG, IRAP and VAT issued by the Casoria tax office about assessed taxes of 
€6.5 million. The company has been challenged for the following violations: (i) undue deduction of costs of €3.1 
million contrary to the principle of pertinence/accruals basis; and (ii) undue deduction of VAT of €2.0 million as 
a result of the application of a higher-than-allowed rate.  
The Naples Provincial Tax Commission accepted the company’s appeal in its ruling no. 497 filed on 25 June 
2009, which the tax office appealed. The company presented its defence brief and counter-appeal. The Naples 
Regional Tax Commission confirmed that costs of €2,771,179.66 were to be taxed, due to their non-compliance 
with the pertinence/accruals basis principle in its ruling no. 27/1/12 filed on 12 January 2012 while also 
confirming the deductibility of VAT of €1,839,943.61. The tax office has appealed to the Supreme Court. The 
company in turn has presented its defence brief and appeal. A date for the court hearing has not yet been set. 
2) Assessment notice for 2004 VAT issued by the Casoria tax office about assessed VAT of €5.2 million. It 
alleges the company unduly deducted VAT based on the assumption that all the services received by it should 
have been invoiced with the lower rate of 10% instead of the ordinary rate (20%). The Naples Provincial Tax 
Commission accepted the company’s appeal in its ruling no. 498/01/09 filed on 25 June 2009 and cancelled the 
assessment notice, which the tax office appealed. The company presented its defence brief and counter-appeal. 
The Naples Regional Tax Commission handed down its ruling no. 26/1/2012 filed on 23 January 2020, which (i) 
after having decided in favour of the company, fully in line with its defence grounds, which was the “quaestio 
iuris”, whose resolution was essential to confirm or cancel the tax assessment; and (ii) nonetheless confirmed 
the tax office’s assessed taxes and related fines (i.e., as recalculated by the tax office in its appeal). The 
company has appealed to the Supreme Court and the hearing date was set as 23 March 2020. 
3) Assessment notice for the 2012 IMU property tax, issued by the Acerra municipal authorities for the assessed 
tax of €551 thousand for the WtE plant. The company promptly presented its appeal which was filed on 20 April 
2017. The Provincial Tax Commission rejected the appeal with ruling no. 17386 filed on 14 December 2017 
which the company appealed on 5 July 2019. The Regional Tax Commission handed down its ruling on 13 
January 2020, which was not in the company’s favour. The term for filing an appeal with the Supreme Court has 
not yet expired. 
With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the subsidiary believes that it has 
acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. When it deemed it appropriate to 
settle the dispute, as explained earlier in more detail, it did so to avail of the various options provided for by the 
relevant legislation, such as the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes or the positions 
assigned to  the tax collection  agency, the court-ordered settlement procedure and the mutually-agreed 
settlement procedure.
