 
Methodology for reporting non-financial information 
Salini Impregilo was the first Italian construction company to prepare and publish an Environmental Report in 
2002 and similarly it was the first to publish a Sustainability Report drawn up in accordance with the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines in 2009. 
 
Standards applied  
This 2019 Consolidated Non-financial Statement has been prepared in accordance with Legislative decree no. 
254/2016. The Company has used the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (Core option), published by the 
GRI. This Statement also constitutes the Communication on Progress (COP) to Global Compact.
