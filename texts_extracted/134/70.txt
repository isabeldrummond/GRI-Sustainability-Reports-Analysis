 
Adjusted revenue for the year is €5,331.2 million compared to €5,414.4 million for 2018. The main contributors 
to the adjusted revenue are some large projects and, specifically, Lane’s projects, the high speed/capacity 
railway works for the Milan - Genoa railway line section, the Ethiopian contracts, the projects in Saudi Arabia 
including the design and building of the new Riyadh Metro and the Rogun Dam in Tajikistan.  
The adjusted gross operating profit amounts to €422.6 million (€423.4 million) while the adjusted operating profit 
comes to €183.9 million (€222.2 million). 
The adjusted net financing costs approximate €73.2 million compared to €76.8 million for 2018. They include:  
-  financial expense of €147.1 million (€145.8 million); partly offset by:  
-  financial income of €69.6 million (€55.8 million); 
-  net exchange gains of €4.3 million (€13.3 million).  
Net losses on equity investments come to €19.1 million, compared to net losses of €16.5 million for 2018, due 
to the losses recognised by the equity-accounted investees. 
The profit before tax amounts to €91.6 million, a decrease on the balance of €128.9 million for 2018.  
The income taxes for the year are €77.7 million (€79.0 million).  
The loss from discontinued operations of €0.9 million (profit of €114.8 million) entirely reflects the costs of the 
USW Campania business unit for the year. The profit for 2018 also included the loss of €115.2 million made by 
Lane’s Plants & Paving Division, which was sold in December 2018. 
Non-controlling interests amount to a profit of €8.0 million. They mainly relate to the group companies working 
in Saudi Arabia on the construction of Line 3 of the Riyadh Metro. The loss for 2018 was due to the allocation 
of the loss for that year to non-controlling interests.
