 
•  combating harassment and discrimination, including by making suitable and formalised whistle-blowing 
tools available; 
•  encouraging and active promotion (for example, through communication and training projects) of an 
inclusive culture and an awareness that diversity is positive; 
•  the ability to work with all cultures as an integral part of the leadership model; 
•  a request of its suppliers to commit to diversity and inclusion; 
•  monitoring and reporting on commitments and results in the areas of diversity and inclusion. 
The Company has appointed a Diversity Manager, who is part of the Group’s HR and Organisation Department 
and monitors the implementation of diversity and inclusion policies and practices. 
Salin Impregilo’s commitment to these two issues is reflected in all areas.  
The Group has employees of more than 100 nationalities, 69% of the workforce is local, increasing to roughly 
96% in Africa and the Americas. Local managers make up 70% of the total (more information is available in the 
“Social” section of this Statement).  
With respect to diversity, the Group’s leadership status is enriched by the ideas and outlook of international 
managers from non-construction sectors. International resources cover 24% of the Group’s key positions. 
Another important contributor to diversity is the young age of the Group’s resources. The following tables provide 
a breakdown of its employees by age bracket:

With respect to gender diversity, the Company proactively promotes equal opportunities for men and women in 
a sector that has traditionally been a male domain.
