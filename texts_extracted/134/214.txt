Research and development 
Salini Impregilo carried out industrial research and experimental development activities during the year. These 
activities enabled the acquisition of new know-how and improvement of production efficiency, which will improve 
the parent’s competitive edge. 
The main R&D macro projects carried out during the year are described below: 
•  ideation,  feasibility  study,  prototyping  and  experimental  development  of  advanced  virtual  multi-
dimensional models and tools to optimise the planning, design, construction and operation of complex 
building and civil works; 
•  ideation, study and development of an innovative system for the construction of aggregates for concrete 
using raw materials that were originally not compliant through the study of a dedicated technology and 
manufacturing process; 
•  study and experimental development of innovative electrical systems for the 4.0 work sites; 
•  feasibility  study,  design,  prototyping,  development  and  experimental  validation  of  a  new 
methodology/equipment for the installation of vertical pipes in underwater environments, called Riser 
Concept: 
•  study, design, prototyping, development and experimental validation of a large capacity, automated 
conveyor belt system; 
•  study, design, prototyping, development and experimental validation of a large capacity, reversible 
suspended conveyor belt - Flyingbelt; 
•  ideation, study, design, development and experimental validation of new technologies to build large 
complex civil works. 
 
These macro projects related to the following areas: 
a)  experimental or theoretical work, with the main aim being the acquisition of new knowledge on the 
foundations of phenomena and observable facts; 
b)  planned research or critical investigations to acquire knowledge to be used to fine-tune new products, 
processes or services or allow the upgrading of existing products, processes or services or create parts of 
complex systems;  
c)  acquisition, blending, structuring and utilisation of knowledge and existing scientific, technological and 
commercial capabilities to prepare plans, projects or designs for new products, processes or services, or to 
modify or improve them, including feasibility studies; 
d)  development of prototypes to be used for commercial purposes and pilot projects for technological or 
commercial testing; 
e)  production and testing of innovative products, processes and services.
