 
When the expected cash flows are included in an estimate range with the same probability of occurrence, the 
median value is discounted to measure the liability.

Translation criteria for foreign currency items  
The translation criteria for foreign currency items adopted by the company are as follows: 
•  foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, excluding property, plant and equipment, intangible assets 
and equity investments measured at cost, are translated at the closing spot rate with any exchange rate 
gains or losses taken to profit or loss; 
•  non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are recognised at historical cost denominated in the 
foreign currency and translated using the historical exchange rate; 
•  revenue and costs related to foreign currency transactions are recognised in profit or loss at the exchange 
rate ruling on the date of the transaction; 
•  any material effects deriving from changes in exchange rates after the reporting date are disclosed in the 
notes. 
The foreign branches’ functional currency is the Euro, as it is the primary currency they use in their operations. 
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. 
Assets held for sale are recognised as such when the following events take place: 
•  signing of a binding sales agreement;  
•  approval and communication of a formal sales plan by directors. 
In order to be correctly measured, the assets shall be:  
•  available for immediate sale in their present condition, 
•  subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets, and  
•  the sale must be highly probable and expected to take place within twelve months. 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or classified as held for 
sale and that meets any of the following criteria: i) it represents a separate major line of business or geographical 
area of operations; ii) it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations; or iii) it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a plan to resell.
