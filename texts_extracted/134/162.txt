Given that it mainly operates as a contractor on behalf of public and private clients, the Group is required to 
scrupulously adhere to the contractual provisions about engagement with local stakeholders. These provisions 
establish the roles and responsibilities each party is obliged to comply with.  
In line with these provisions, the Group defines procedures to handle engagement with local stakeholders (such 
as, for example, the grievance mechanisms) and the communication channels to be used at work sites either 
physical (e.g., public relations offices) or technological (dedicated phone numbers, websites, email addresses, 
etc.).  
The clients are responsible for engagement with the local communities in most of the ongoing contracts while 
the Group provides technical and operating assistance to manage any issues that arise. Matters discussed by 
contract personnel and the local communities mostly relate to: 
•  employment and interaction between the work site and surrounding areas; 
•  the characteristics of the work under construction and its possible social and environmental implications. 
As described in detail in the section “The infrastructure sector and Salini Impregilo’s role”, the Group’s clients 
are responsible for planning and developing projects. When required by the applicable regulations, this includes 
an assessment of the social and environmental impacts, the prior consultation of the stakeholders, definition of 
the mitigation and compensation actions and receipt of the authorisations. Therefore, the clients have sole 
responsibility for handling relations with the stakeholders for the second category of topics mentioned earlier, 
while the Group provides assistance with management of the relationships covering the first category of topics. 
This is a potential source of risks for the Group as, if the client does not properly and efficiently manage its 
responsibilities, the local community could oppose the project leading to delays in the works, an increase in
