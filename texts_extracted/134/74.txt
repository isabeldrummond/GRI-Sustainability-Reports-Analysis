 
Operating profit  
The operating profit amounts to €256.8 million for the period (€68.1 million), showing a significant improvement 
on the previous year. 
The increase in this item is mainly due to the reduction of Condotte’s interest in COCIV to the minimum (0.001%) 
(the notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements provide more information about this), which 
impacted the gross operating profit by approximately €107.5 million, the reduction of €102.4 million (€194.5 
million) in impairment losses, as a result of the larger losses recognised in 2018. 
Amortisation, depreciation and provisions of €171.9 million (€150.7 million) increased principally as a result of 
higher depreciation expense on the right-of-use assets recognised since 1 January 2019 in accordance with 
IFRS 16 - Leases.  
Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on equity investments 
The Group recorded net financing costs of €73.2 million (€72.9 million).  
The item comprises:  
-  financial expense of €147.1 million (€141.9 million); partly offset by:  
-  financial income of €69.6 million (€55.8 million); 
-  net exchange gains of €4.3 million (net losses of €13.3 million). 
The rise in financial expense is mostly due to the effect of the measurement of loan assets recognised at 31 
December 2019 in accordance with IFRS 9 and payment of interest of €13.7 million by the Ethiopian branch for 
the years from 2014 to 2016 as part of a tax assessment. This increase is partly offset by the reduction in 
financial expense on the bonds of approximately €10.7 million compared to the previous year following the 
redemption of the unsecured senior bonds in August 2018. 
The €13.8 million increase in financial income is chiefly related to Constructora Ariguani and comprises interest 
accrued  as  compensation  on  the  recovery  of  an  advance  paid  after  the  dispute  with  the  former 
partner/subcontractor Conalvias was settled in the second half of 2019. 
Net exchange gains of €4.3 million mainly arose on the Euro’s performance vis-à-vis the US dollar and Ethiopian 
birr. 
Net losses on equity investments came to €127.7 million (€29.5 million). The increase in this item is due to the 
Group’s share of losses of equity-accounted investees (mostly belonging to Lane Group) and, in particular, the 
joint venture working on the I-4 Ultimate contract. It made a loss in 2019 due to the higher costs incurred. At the 
date of preparation of this report, the joint venture is preparing a claim which will include additional consideration 
for these costs.
