Fair value measurement hierarchy 
IFRS 7 requires that the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position be 
classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair value. 
There are three different levels: 
•  Level 1 - Fair values measured using quoted prices in active markets; 
•  Level 2 - Fair values measured using valuation techniques for which inputs significant to the fair value 
measurement are based on observable market data; 
•  Level 3 - Fair values measured using valuation techniques for which inputs significant to the fair value 
measurement are based on unobservable market data. 
Financial instruments recognised by the Group at fair value are classified at the following levels:

Derivative assets  11   -  268  - 
Derivative liabilities  25   -  (2,012)  - 
Total    -  (1,744)  -
