From an economical standpoint, the US economy continues to grow with positive development prospects. The 
IMF’s most recent forecasts of January 2020 show GDP growth of 2.3% in 2019.  
The growth rate seen since 2009 has continued one of the longest expansionary phases of the US economy to 
date. In December 2019, the US Department of Labour announced that the unemployment rate was around 
3.5%, down 0.4% on the December 2018 figure. 
According to the 2020 construction market report issued by CRESME, an Italian research centre, in November 
2019, the US market will be one of the largest markets in the world in terms of investments in construction, with 
just China ahead of it.  
The  Trump  Administration  has  prioritised  the  construction  of  infrastructure  during  its  mandate  and  has 
announced projects worth more than USD1,000 billion will be rolled out before 2027 in the energy and transport 
sectors (President Trump announced that this amount had been increased to USD1,500 billion in his State of 
the Union address in January 2018).
