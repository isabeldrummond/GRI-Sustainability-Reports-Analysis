 
•  assets and liabilities, costs and revenue shown in the subsidiaries’ financial statements are fully 
recognised, regardless of the size of the investment therein; 
•  the carrying amount of the investment is eliminated against the Group’s share of its equity; 
•  the main transactions between consolidated entities, including dividends distributed among group 
companies, are eliminated; 
•  non-controlling interests are shown separately under equity and their share of the profit or loss for the 
year is similarly shown separately in the statement of profit or loss. 
-  Investments in associates and joint ventures are measured using the equity method whereby the carrying 
amount of the investment is adjusted to consider: 
•  standardisation to comply with the group accounting policies, where necessary; 
•  the parent’s share of the profits or losses of the investee realised after the acquisition date; 
•  modifications arising from changes in equity of the investee that are not taken to profit or loss as per the 
relevant IFRS; 
•  dividends distributed by the investees; 
•  any greater value paid at acquisition (measured using the same criteria set out in the section on 
“Business combinations”) and managed pursuant to the relevant standard; 
•  the share of the profit or loss deriving from application of the equity method, which is taken to profit or 
loss. 
-  Interests in joint ventures that qualify as joint operations are recognised by the investor to the extent of its 
share of the rights and obligations held. 
Dividends, reversals of impairment losses and impairment losses on investments in consolidated companies, 
gains and losses on the intragroup exchange of investments in consolidated entities and the related tax effects 
are eliminated. 
Gains and losses arising from transactions between consolidated companies, which are not realised directly or 
indirectly through transactions with third parties, are eliminated. Unrealised intragroup losses are recognised 
when the transaction shows an impairment of the transferred asset. 
 
Business combinations 
Business combinations are recognised using the acquisition method set out in IFRS 3 (revised in 2008). 
Accordingly, the consideration for a business combination is measured at fair value, being the sum of the fair 
value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed or incurred by the Group at the acquisition date and the 
equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquired entity. Transaction costs are recognised in 
profit or loss when incurred.
