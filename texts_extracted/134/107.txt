Internal policies 
People, their skills and their dedication are fundamental to any organisation’s competitive edge. Human capital 
is an increasingly critical success factor given the nature of Salini Impregilo’s business, consisting of the building 
of unique large, complex infrastructure projects, its need to understand and have a flexible organisation that can 
adapt to different cultures and the complex transformation it is currently undergoing. 
The adoption of a HR strategy and policy is essential and they must underpin the Group’s strategic objectives 
through the efficient management of human resources and the organisation.   
Objectives: 
-  guarantee that employees act in accordance with common rules and practices in compliance with the 
Code of Ethics and the Company’s values; 
-  foster an inclusive work environment that enhances individual skills and encourages employees to 
develop their potential; 
-  cultivate diversity and inclusion as levers to understand the various cultural contexts in which Salini 
Impregilo  operates,  to  encourage  innovation  and  the  ongoing  improvement  of  decision-making 
processes key to achievement of the business objectives; 
-  attract, retain and motivate employees by guaranteeing their best placement within the Group to 
enhance their talents and growth; 
-  maintain the highest levels of protection for health and safety in the workplace for its employees, 
ensuring  the  necessary  prevention  and  protection  measures  are  in  place  to  avoid  or  minimise 
occupational risks and instil a safety-based culture at all levels and proactive and ethical conduct; 
-  encourage the adoption of a single organisational model throughout the Group, based on structures and 
processes to create value and to concurrently comply with the legislation of all the countries where Salini 
Impregilo operates;
