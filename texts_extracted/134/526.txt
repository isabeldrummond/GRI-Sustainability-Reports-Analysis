REPORT OF THE BOARD OF STATUTORY AUDITORS  
PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 153 OF LEGISLATIVE DECREE NO. 58/1998  
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING OF 4 MAY 2020 
 
Dear shareholders, 
The current board of statutory auditors was appointed by the shareholders of Salini Impregilo S.p.A. (the 
“company”) on 27 April 2017. Its term of office ends with the shareholders’ meeting called to approve the 
separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019. 
Pursuant to article 153.1 of Legislative decree no. 58 of 24 February 1998 (the “Consolidated Finance Act” 
or the “TUF”), we note that we performed our supervisory and control duties prescribed by the current 
regulations during the year, with specific reference to the Italian Civil Code, article 148 and subsequent 
articles of the TUF, Legislative decree no. 39 of 27 January 2010 as amended by Legislative decree no. 135 
of 17 July 2016 and Legislative decree no. 254/2016. We also considered the guidelines set out in the 
Consob (the Italian Commission for Listed Companies and the Stock Exchange) communications about the 
duties of statutory auditors, the guidance of the Code of Conduct for Listed Companies and the ethical 
standards  recommended  by  the  Italian  Accounting  Profession  (Consiglio  Nazionale  dei  Dottori 
Commercialisti e degli Esperti Contabili). 
We have prepared this report for the shareholders’ meeting called to meet on 4 May 2020 on single call 
to approve the separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019 (as well as 
on the other matters listed in the call notice, to which reference should be made). 
That being said, we describe below our activities performed during the year and up to the date of this 
report, including as required by Consob communication no. DEM/1025564 of 6 April 2001 as subsequently 
amended. 
 
1.  Significant financial or capital transactions 
We note the following key events and transactions which took place in 2019: 
-  On 14 February 2019, the company - as is public knowledge - presented an offer for a potential 
investment in Astaldi S.p.A. to support its business continuity proposal underpinning its application for 
a deed of arrangement procedure subject to the court’s approval of this application.    
-  On 2 August 2019, the company announced the commencement of a project to relaunch the Italian 
large works sector (“Progetto Italia”). To this end, it entered into two investment agreements on the 
same date: the first with the controlling shareholder Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and CDP Equity S.p.A. 
(“CDPE”), a subsidiary of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A.; and the second with three major Italian banks 
to establish, inter alia, (i) the terms and conditions for the subscription of part of the capital increase 
to serve Progetto Italia by CDPE and Salini Costruttori, and (ii) the related introduction of certain 
corporate governance rules.The key terms of the investment agreement were published on the 
company’s website and filed with the Company Registrar on 7 August 2019 as required by the ruling 
regulations. On 4 October 2019, as provided for by the investment agreements, the shareholders met 
in an extraordinary meeting to (a) authorise the board of directors to increase the share capital; and 
(b) resolve on the related amendments to the by-laws. On 12 November 2019, the company executed 
its capital increase to serve Progetto Italia. As a result, at 31 December 2019, the company’s share 
capital amounted to €600,000,000.00, comprising 893,788,182 shares, of which 892,172,691 ordinary 
shares and 1,615,491 savings shares, all without a nominal amount.
