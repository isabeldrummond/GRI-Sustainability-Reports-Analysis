Segment reporting is presented according to macro geographical regions, based on the management review 
approach adopted by senior management, for the ‘“Italy”, “Abroad” and “Lane Group” operating segments. 
Costs relating to activities which are carried out by the parent, Salini Impregilo, called “Corporate” costs, are 
attributed to the Italy segment and relate to: 
•  planning of human and financial resources; 
•  coordination and assistance with the group companies’ administrative, tax, legal/corporate and institutional 
and business communications requirements. 
These costs amounted to €153.0 million for 2019 compared to €163.6 million for the previous year. 
Management measures the segments’ results by considering their operating profit.  
It measures their equity structure using their net invested capital.
