Internal policies 
Protection of the environment is a priority for the Group which formalised a specific Environmental Policy in 
2002, one of the first European construction companies to do so. In 2007, it introduced an environmental 
management system which is ISO 14001 certified. In 2017, the certification was upgraded to the 2015 version, 
which puts greater emphasis on the life cycle perspective, the sustainable supply chain and environmental 
performance. 
Salini Impregilo’s Environmental Policy defines ten principles to guarantee: 
-  compliance with applicable legal requirements and any other agreed-to requirements; 
-  identification and assessment of environmental aspects tied to the Company’s direct and indirect, 
present and future operations, evaluation of the related significant effects and management of the 
mitigation and control measures; 
-  identification of all the technical and organisational measures designed for the rational use of natural 
resources and the mitigation of pollution, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, waste generation and 
inconvenience to the local communities as well as the maximisation of the positive effects for the 
environment;  
-  involvement and participation of all employees or people who work for the Company through actions to 
make them aware of the issue, the dissemination of information and training courses, dialogue and 
transparency in action. 
The Policy also provides that each worker has the right and is obliged to intervene and stop work if the 
environment could potentially be compromised. 
During the realisation of awarded projects, the Group ensures compliance with the above-mentioned principles 
in accordance with the commitments taken on with its clients. More information about Salini Impregilo’s role and
