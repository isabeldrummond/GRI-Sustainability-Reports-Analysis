The balance includes bank account credit balances at the end of the year and the amounts of cash, cheques 
and valuables at the registered offices, work sites and foreign branches. Liquidity management is designed to 
ensure the financial independence of ongoing contracts, considering the structure of the consortia and SPEs, 
which may limit the availability of financial resources to achievement of the related projects. Liquidity 
management also considers the existence of constraints to the transfer of currency imposed by certain 
countries. In this respect, the liquidity in Africa mainly comprises local currency that cannot be exported and is 
used for the Ethiopian projects.
