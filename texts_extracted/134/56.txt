Koysha Hydroelectric Project                                       
This project is on the Omo River, about 370 km south-west of the capital Addis Ababa. It was commissioned by 
Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) and includes the construction of a dam with a 9 billion cubic metre capacity 
reservoir, annual energy generation of 6,460 Gwh and total installed capacity of 2,160 MW. The project also 
includes access roads, a new bridge over the river and a 400 KW transmission line from Koysha to GIBE III. 
The contract is worth approximately €2.5 billion and Salini Impregilo’s share is 100%. Work is currently being 
carried out on the project. 
Production activity has slowed down, mainly due to payment delays by the client. However, this situation has 
changed considerably in the last few months and this should facilitate operations at the work site. 
In 2019, the client requested the number of turbines be decreased from eight to six units and Salini Impregilo is 
evaluating this request’s feasibility. 
Gerd                                           
The Gerd project, located approximately 500 km north west of the capital Addis Ababa, consists of the 
construction of a hydroelectric power plant, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), and the largest 
dam in the African continent (1,800 metres long, 170 metres high). The project also includes the construction of 
two power stations on the banks of the Blue Nile, equipped with 16 turbines with total installed capacity of 6,350 
MW.  
The client has notified a reduction of the turbines from 16 to 13. Salini Impregilo has requested more information 
and has issued a variation order for the additional design costs. 
The contract is worth approximately €3.8 billion and Salini Impregilo’s share is 100%. The project is at an 
advanced stage of completion.
