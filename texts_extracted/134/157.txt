Internal policies 
It is a well-known fact that the direct relationship between investments in infrastructure and greater domestic 
demand leverages economic growth. Construction companies engaged in building infrastructure may contribute 
to this factor by adopting suitable internal policies. 
Salini Impregilo is committed to contributing to the social and economic development of the areas where it 
operates in line with its Code of Ethics and Sustainability Policy, through:  
•  employment of workers from the area in which the projects are taking place, when available in the 
numbers required and who have the necessary skills;  
•  professional training of local personnel; 
•  procurement  strategies  designed  to  meet  requirements  using  local  supplies  as  far  as  possible, 
depending on the availability of the required goods and services; 
•  initiatives to assist the local communities, after checking the integrity and respectability of the recipients 
and the projects’ consistency with the Code of Ethics.  
The Company is also committed to respecting the rights and culture of the local communities which it does by 
also using appropriate communication channels in line with the relevant regulatory and contractual provisions. 
Main risks and management methods 
The Group identifies the risks and defines methods to manage the social aspects described in this section (hiring 
of local labour and procurement, relations with the local stakeholders) during the start-up stage of its projects.  
The project start-up process complies with the Project Management principles (ISO 21500) and entails the 
proactive involvement of the project team and the corporate departments to ensure the integrated management 
of internal and external factors.
