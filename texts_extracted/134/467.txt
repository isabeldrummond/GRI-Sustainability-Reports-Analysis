 
Risk management 
Salini Impregilo is exposed to financial risks, including the following: 
•  market risk deriving from the company’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate 
fluctuations; 
•  credit risk deriving from the company’s exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ non-
compliance with their obligations; 
•  liquidity risk deriving from the risk that the financial resources necessary to meet obligations may not be 
available at the agreed terms and deadlines. 
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market prices. Market risk comprises currency risk and interest rate risk. 
Currency risk 
Salini Impregilo’s international presence entails its exposure to currency risk arising from fluctuations in the 
value of trade and financial transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of the individual 
companies, branches or joint operations. The company has adopted a currency risk management strategy to 
mitigate this risk based on the guidelines described in the “Risk management system” section of the Directors’ 
report to which reference is made. 
Currency risk at 31 December 2019 mainly related to the following currencies:  
•  US dollar (USD) 
•  Ethiopian Birr (BIRR) 
•  Australian dollar (AUD) 
•  Colombian peso (COP) 
•  United Arab Emirates dirham (AED) 
•  Tajikistani somoni (TJS) 
The company considers assets and liabilities of the companies, branches or joint operations in currencies other 
than its functional currency, net of derivatives agreed to hedge the above trade and financial transactions, when 
assessing the potential effects of fluctuations in the above currencies. 
The following table shows the results of the sensitivity analysis, which considers a 5% increase or decrease in 
the exchange rates compared to the actual exchange rates at 31 December 2018 and 2017 to reflect the 
potential effects on profit (loss) and equity.
