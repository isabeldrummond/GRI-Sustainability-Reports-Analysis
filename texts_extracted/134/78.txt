Working capital 
Working capital increased by €168.8 million from €439.9 million at 31 December 2018 to €608.7 million at the 
reporting date. 
The main changes in the individual items making up net working capital are summarised below: 
•  contract assets amount to €2,040.5 million (€1,512.9 million). The increase of €527.6 million is the net 
balance of the reduction in contract advances (€168.4 million) and the increase in contract work in progress 
net of progress payments (on approved work) mostly related to certain large projects in Saudi Arabia such 
as the design and construction of the new Riyadh metro line, the housing and urbanisation project 
commissioned by the Saudi Arabia National Guard (SANG Villas) and the Rogun Dam in Tajikistan. 
•  loans and receivables decreased by €104.7 million, principally as a result of the reduction in amounts due 
from the Ethiopian customer following collections received during the year;  
•  current liabilities increased by €225.4 million, chiefly due to the greater liabilities with unconsolidated group 
companies and other related parties, mainly in connection with the projects for the Genoa Bridge and the 
Naples - Cancello section of the Naples - Bari railway line.
