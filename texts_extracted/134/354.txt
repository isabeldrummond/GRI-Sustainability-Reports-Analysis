40. Earnings per share 
Earnings per share are disclosed at the foot of the statement of comprehensive income. 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit (loss) for the year attributable to the owners of 
the parent by the weighted average of the shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are 
calculated considering the weighted average of the outstanding shares adjusted by assuming the conversion 
of all the shares with potentially diluting effects.  
The following table summarises the calculation. At the reporting date, the parent’s share capital consists of 
892,172,691 ordinary shares and 1,615,491 savings shares.  
The Group has 1,330,845 treasury shares in portfolio.
