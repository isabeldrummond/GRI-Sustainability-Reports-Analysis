•  reclassifications of €79.7 million to right-of-use assets as a result of the application of IFRS 16 on 1 January 
2019; 
•  increases of €85.4 million, mainly related to the Australian joint venture Snowy Hydro (€21.1 million), now 
fully operational, Lane (€20.7 million), Salini Saudi Arabia Ltd (€6.1 million) and investments made for the 
two Paris metro lines (€5.6 million) and the Meydan One Mall project in Dubai (€4.7 million); 
•  disposals of €20.7 million, principally related to plant and machinery. These disposals mostly refer to the 
nearly completed Red Line North Underground project in Doha (Qatar) (€4.5 million), COCIV (€4.3 million) 
and Lane Group (€4.3 million); 
•  an increase in assets under construction and payments on account, mostly related to the Australian joint 
venture for the Snowy 2.0 hydropower plant; 
•  the change in consolidation scope mostly refers to the acquisition of Cossi Group and its line-by-line 
consolidation; 
•  the reclassifications show the effect of the items recognised in “Right-of-use assets”. 
 
8. Right-of-use assets 
Right-of-use assets amount to €144.2 million and reflect the application of IFRS 16 using the modified 
retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of the FTA is recognised in retained earnings at 1 January 
2019. Therefore, the Group has not restated the figures at 1 December 2018, presented in accordance with IAS 
17. More information about the application of the new standard is available in the section on “Changes in 
standards”.  
The historical cost and carrying amounts of the right-of-use assets are shown in the following table:
