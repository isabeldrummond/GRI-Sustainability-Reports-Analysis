Impairment losses of €36.1 million mainly relate to the Venezuelan contracts (€35.7 million) as a result of the 
impairment test performed at the reporting date (reference should be made to the “Venezuela” paragraph of the 
“Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report and note 12 “Trade receivables” - paragraph 
on “Impairment - Venezuela”). The impairment losses recognised on the Venezuelan contracts amounted to 
€165.5 million in 2018. 
On 1 January 2019, following the transition to IFRS 16, which introduced new guidelines for the accounting 
treatment of leased assets and their depreciation, the company introduced a new item “Depreciation of right-of-
use assets”. In 2018, depreciation of leased assets was included under depreciation of property, plant and 
equipment. 
Amortisation and depreciation of €74.6 million decreased by €5.2 million on the previous year. They are in line 
with the progress made on the related contracts. The decreases mainly refer to contracts in Ethiopia, whereas 
the increases relate to the construction of the Rogun Dam in Tajikistan. 
Provisions include the €45.8 million accrual made during the year to reflect the situation of the consortium 
member Condotte (see note 23).
