The Group’s foreign concessions comprise both investments in the operators, which are fully operational and, 
hence, provide services for a fee or at rates applied to the infrastructure’s users, and operators that are still 
developing and constructing the related infrastructure and will only provide the related service in future years. 
The current concessions are held in Latin America (Argentina, Colombia and Peru), Canada, the UK and Turkey. 
They refer to the transportation sector (motorways and metro systems), hospitals, renewable energy and water 
treatment sectors. 
The two Argentine operators are currently in liquidation and their contracts have been terminated. During 2020, 
the Group sold its stake in Consorcio Agua Azul S.A. for roughly USD13 million. The following tables show the 
main figures of the foreign concessions at the reporting date, broken down by business segment:
