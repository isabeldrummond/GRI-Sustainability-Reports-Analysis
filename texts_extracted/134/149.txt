 
Specifically, 24 work sites (the equivalent of 44.5 sq km) were located in protected areas (mostly in the US, 
followed by Italy, the United Arab Emirates and France) and 56 (the equivalent of 4.7 sq km) in areas adjacent 
to protected areas (mostly in the US, followed by Australia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Italy and Poland). 
Of these sites, 63 are in areas protected by local regulations, ten in areas protected by national regulations, six 
in “Natura 2000” areas and one in wetlands included in the Ramsar List. There are 11 work sites located in 
ecosystems that contain water (e.g., lakes, rivers, swamps, etc.), six in urban ecosystems, nine in agricultural 
ecosystems, 49 in wood ecosystems, four in mountain ecosystems and one in insular ecosystems. In these 
areas, construction and plant operation activities are mainly carried out.   
Contracts performed in areas of special natural or cultural interest require specific procedures to manage the 
protected species (flora and fauna) and/or areas and any archaeological finds. The Group is assisted by 
independent experts and involves the local authorities.  
Once construction has been completed, the areas affected by the work, access roads, plants, installations, 
quarries and deposits are cleaned up to return the areas to their original conditions in line with the contractual 
terms and current regulations. These restoration activities facilitate natural revegetation, prevent soil erosion 
and improve soil stability. 
Any land reclamation activities, if provided for in the contract and necessary due to previous contamination, are 
agreed with the clients and performed in line with the competent authorities’ instructions.  
Environmental restoration activities may include reforestation and indigenous species are usually used. The 
main restoration activities performed by the Group are shown below: 
Protection and restoration activities (GRI 304-3)  Unit  2017  2018  2019 
Reforested area  m2  293,281  391,144  188,140 
Areas where the topsoil was replaced  m2  3,304,357  3,674,094  710,295 
 
The reduction in protection and restoration activities is mostly due to progress on Lane’s contracts (USA). In 
2019, the Group carried out reforestation activities mainly for the Koysha project (Ethiopia), the projects of Lane 
(USA) and the Forrestfield-Airport Link (Australia) planting 5,115 trees.
