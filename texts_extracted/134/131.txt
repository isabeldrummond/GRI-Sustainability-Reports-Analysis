 
A significant part of its 2019 revenue was earned on projects that actively contribute to the fight against climate 
change. The “Salini Impregilo Group: Our vision and performance” section of the Directors’ report provides more 
information on this.  
 
The Group’s contribution to mitigation of climate change  
The energy and transport sectors are the biggest culprits in terms of GHG emissions. The Group works in both 
these sectors building infrastructure that allows for a significant reduction in these emissions. The following 
graphs provide a comparison of the emission levels of the main electricity generation sources18 and transport19, 
showing the business areas in which the Group operates with energy (hydropower) and sustainable mobility 
(metros and railways) contracts. 
 
These ongoing projects include five hydropower plants and twenty metro and light rail lines, railway lines and 
high speed lines. They generate environmental benefits in terms of very significantly lower emissions, as 
summarised below.
