Dear shareholders,  
We propose to allocate the profit of €70,960,125.31 shown in the draft separate financial statements at 31 
December 2019 as follows: 
 
•  nothing to the legal reserve, as it has already reached one-fifth of the share capital as required by article 
2430 of the Italian Civil Code; 
•  €26,725,255.38 as a dividend to each existing share with dividend rights, equal to €0.030 per share, 
including the legal withholding, excluding the 1,330,845 treasury shares currently held by the company; 
•  €420,027.66 as a dividend to each savings share equal to €0.26 per share, as per article 33.b) of the 
by-laws, including the legal withholding; 
•  €43,814,842.27 to retained earnings. 
 
We propose that the aforementioned ordinary and savings dividends be distributed on 18 May 2020, with an ex-
dividend date of 20 May 2020 (record date of 19 May 2020).
