 
We prioritised safety throughout the year and have received accolades for our commitment and results achieved 
in all the countries where we operate in recent years, including in complex situations like those linked to the 
current COVID-19 pandemic. Once again, this year, we bettered our injury rate by another 25%, an achievement 
that we intend to improve on day by day. We will continue to invest in the creation of a shared culture that places 
safety at the centre of our business, strengthening training and internal communication activities to raise 
employee and vendor awareness of the fundamental value of safety in our work places.    
Our aim for 2020 is to continue to improve our economic, financial and sustainable performances through our 
strategic plan designed to ensure the satisfaction of our shareholders and investors, that believe in the value of 
our business, and progress towards the SDGS, notwithstanding the impact that COVID-19 will have on the 
world.
