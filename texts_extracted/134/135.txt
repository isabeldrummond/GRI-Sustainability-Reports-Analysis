The considerable reduction in natural gas and LPG in 2019 is due to the sale of Lane’s Plants & Paving division 
in the US as it uses large quantities of these energy sources. The reduction in the consumption of diesel, petrol 
and electricity is also a result of the above sale. However, the smaller diesel consumption is mostly due to the 
lesser work carried out on the GERD and Koysha projects in Ethiopia. The large contraction in subcontractors’ 
consumption, and related Scope 3 GHG emissions, is principally a result of the projects of Salini Polska (Poland), 
the Rogun project (Tajikistan) and the opening of the Copenhagen Cityringen metro in Denmark.  
The Group’s main energy rationalisation systems include the use of highly efficient vehicles and equipment, 
connecting its building site plants to electricity networks rather than diesel generators, carrying out regular 
maintenance programmes for its vehicles, improving power quality and informing its employees about the 
importance of energy saving. 
Significant contributors to the reduction in GHG emissions are the projects to connect to the electricity grid 
systems, especially when the host country’s energy mix is mostly made up of renewable energy. This is the 
case in Ethiopia, where the GERD hydropower project work site uses renewable energy generated by other 
hydropower plants already active in this country, shortly to be joined by the Koysha work site, where a power 
line to the national grid is currently being laid.
