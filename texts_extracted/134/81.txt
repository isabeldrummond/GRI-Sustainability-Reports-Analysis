 
Presentation of the results in US dollars  
In accordance with the IFRS, the parent prepared its consolidated financial statements in Euros which is the 
functional currency of the reporting entity. However, given the materiality of the transactions in currencies other 
than the Euro at group level, the parent has decided to present its results in US dollars in this section.  
Pursuant to IAS 21, this presentation has been prepared using the following criteria: 
a)  the Groupâ€™s assets and liabilities (including the comparative data) have been translated using the closing 
rate of 1.1234 (1.145 at 31 December 2018); 
b)  revenue and costs have been translated using the average rates of the periods to which they refer 
(1.1195 in 2019 and 1.181 in 2018). 
The adjusted reclassified statement of profit or loss and the reclassified statement of profit or loss for 2019 and 
the reclassified statement of financial position at 31 December 2019 of the Group translated into US dollars are 
presented below. As required by IAS 21, the comparative figures for 2018 are also presented.
