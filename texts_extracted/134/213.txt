Disclosure on the adjusted figures 
The Group monitors the key figures of Lane Group for management purposes adjusting the IFRS figures 
prepared for consolidation purposes to present the results of the joint ventures not controlled by Lane which are 
consolidated on a proportionate basis. These figures (“JV not controlled by Lane”) show the status of contracts 
managed directly by Lane or through non-controlling investments in joint ventures.  
In addition, the IFRS figures for 2019 and 2018 have also been adjusted to sterilise the effects of the impairment 
losses recognised on some assets related to the construction of infrastructure in Venezuela. 
Finally, the figures for 2018 have been restated to reflect the effects of FTA of IFRS 16 using the best estimates 
available although this is not required by the new standard as the Group has elected to apply the simplified 
transition approach (“modified retrospective approach”).
