 
The increase in the provision is mainly due to the accrual made as a result of the company’s assessment of the 
recoverable amount of Salini Impregilo’s receivables due, through its involvement in COCIV, from Condotte. 
Given that this consortium member is currently under extraordinary administration, the directors deemed it 
appropriate to make an accrual of €45.8 million. Title to the amounts due from the consortium members lies with 
the consortium. As it is a transparent vehicle, in the case of non-collection of the receivable, the liability is 
recognised in the company’s financial statements using the cost recharging mechanism. Therefore, the company 
makes an accrual in its provisions for risks. 
More information about the main disputes is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the 
Directors’ report.
