 
•  the company’s appeal about reimbursement of tax assets with a nominal amount of €12.3 million acquired 
from third parties as part of previous non-recurring transactions is still pending before the Supreme Court. 
The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not yet been filed; 
•  a dispute related to 2005 about the technique used to “realign” the carrying amount of equity investments 
as per article 128 of Presidential decree no. 917/86 (greater assessed tax base of €4.2 million) is still 
pending before the first level court while with respect to another dispute with the same subject but for 
2004 (greater assessed tax base of €380,000), the Supreme Court accepted the company’s grounds and 
ordered the case be sent to the Lombardy Regional Tax Commission which fully accepted the company’s 
appeal in the hearing of 14 January 2019 with its ruling of 12 February 2019. The tax authorities appealed 
this ruling on 11 September 2019 and the appeal still has to be allocated to the relevant section of the 
court; 
•  with respect to another dispute again related to 2005 and the costs of a joint venture set up in Venezuela 
for which the greater assessed tax base is €6.6 million, the Regional Tax Commission filed its ruling 
entirely in the company’s favour on 19 May 2015; the tax authorities appealed to the Supreme Court on 
28 December 2015 challenging the procedure while stating that the findings do not relate to the appeal. 
The company has filed its defence brief. The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not 
yet been filed; 
•  the company was notified of: (i) a payment order from the tax authorities for Icelandic taxes of €4.6 million, 
which was cancelled after the first and second level sentences in its favour; the tax authorities appealed 
to the Supreme Court on 11 May 2017 and the company presented its defence brief, and (ii) a payment 
bill for the same taxes which the parent appealed. It won again both at first and second level. On 18 
January 2016, the tax authorities presented their appeal to the Supreme Court and the company filed its 
defence brief. The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not yet been filed; 
•  on 12 December 2017, the company and its subsidiary Imprepar received an adjustment notice from the 
tax authorities requesting payment of registration tax of approximately €1.3 million in addition to a fine of 
the same amount on the sale of a business unit to Imprepar (which also received an identical adjustment 
notice). This business unit had no future profits and held investments in consortium companies in 
liquidation or inactive and the related assets and liabilities related to contracts that have been completed 
or are nearing completion due to Imprepar’s know how in managing this type of business. The company 
deems that the tax authorities’ allegations are ungrounded and has promptly appealed against the notices 
to the competent tax commission. The dispute was settled with a court-ordered settlement procedure as 
per article 48 of Legislative decree no. 546/1992 as proposed by the tax authorities. This included a 
reduction in the registration tax and the fine from €1.3 million to €204 thousand and from €1.3 million to 
€82 thousand, respectively; 
•  in August 2019, the Ethiopian branch’s tax audit of 2014, 2015 and 2016 was completed. During the 
preliminary stage of the assessment procedure, the branch met the tax authorities and agreed to settle 
all the assessed taxes for the three years by paying an amount in local currency equal to roughly €32.5 
million (taxes, fines and interest) in order that the tax authorities cancelled the administrative sanctions;
