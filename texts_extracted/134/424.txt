 
The possibility of reducing the defaulting member’s interest in the consortium to the minimum 
interest with immediate effect complies with the by-laws, which do not subject this decision to RFI’s 
approval, as such approval is only required for the by-laws amendment relating to a change in the 
consortium’s membership structure and can be enforced vis-a-vis RFI and third parties; 
▪  the reallocation resolution was passed in accordance with the by-laws and consortium members’ 
agreements and, as such, is fully valid. On the other hand, it may not be enforced vis-a-vis RFI and 
third parties, since the former has a real right of veto on the takeover, which is consistent with its 
role as customer that is entitled to carry out any checks of the consortium’s (ongoing) satisfaction 
of the legal and contractual requirements, as RFI has reserved the right to do after the end of the 
arbitration procedure about the reduction resolution. 
Therefore, summing up the above, with regard to the effectiveness of the reallocation resolution, 
the following distinction should be made:  
•  for the purposes of the internal relationships among consortium members, the resolution is 
immediately enforceable and productive of effects, including financial, as confirmed by the 
provisions  of  the  by-laws  and  consortium  members’  agreements  for  an  automatic 
proportional allocation of the interests transferred from other consortium members and, in 
the case of the consortium members’ agreement, a takeover obligation; 
•  the reallocation resolution, on the other hand, may not be enforced vis-a-vis RFI and third 
parties, since the former has a real right of veto on the takeover, which is consistent with 
its role as customer that is entitled to carry out any checks of the consortium’s (ongoing) 
satisfaction of the legal and contractual requirements, as it has reserved the right to do 
after the end of the arbitration procedure about the reduction resolution. 
With regard to the consortium’s ongoing satisfaction of the relevant requirements following the 
amendment to its by-laws, according to the consortium’s legal advisors, if RFI found that COCIV 
met all  the requirements  to carry out the contracted work in compliance  with the contract 
documents, despite its members including an insolvent party (Condotte), it can only confirm such 
an assessment when evaluating the enforceability of the reallocation of the interest transferred from 
Condotte, which improves, in every significant way, the requirements that can be met by the 
consortium (primarily, its ability to fulfil its obligations, including its guarantee obligations). Since 
RFI has not subordinated its consent to anything else, supported by the opinion of its legal advisors, 
the parent believes that the above resolutions will be maintained by the arbitration proceedings 
underway and RFI’s subsequent assessments; 
▪  on the basis of the opinions of its legal advisors, the parent believes that there are reasonable 
grounds that the arbitration award will be favourable for COCIV, allowing RFI to express its 
conclusions on the few issues mentioned above.
