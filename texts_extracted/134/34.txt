Outlook for 2020 
In line with the new direction undertaken in 2014 with the decree to mobilise work sites (Decree law no. 
133/2014), the 2020 budget law (Law no. 160 of 27 December 2019) includes measures to boost infrastructure 
investments of approximately €20.8 billion, mostly in the period from 2020 to 2034. They include grants for 
municipalities for the implementation of safety measures for buildings and the local areas (€4.9 billion to €8.8 
billion), funds for municipalities for infrastructure investments (€400 million per year from 2025 to 2034), definitive 
and executive design costs borne by local entities (€2.7 billion - safety measures, hydrogeological risk, public 
buildings and municipal assets and roads), a fund for municipality-run playschools (€2.5 billion) and for the road 
system and schools operated by provinces and metropolitan cities (€6.1 billion). The 2020 budget law should 
extend the timeline for compliance with the requirements to tender and set up work sites for the work envisaged 
in the decree to mobilise work sites (Decree law no. 133/2014) in line with its stated intention and to relaunch 
public investments in the infrastructure sector. It should also confirm the strategies designed to identify the 
country’s infrastructure requirements up to 2034. Part of the requirements for the procurement and setting up of 
work sites for the work envisaged in the decree led to the implementation and, in certain cases the completion, 
of the works for strategic projects such as the Milan - Venice high speed railway line, the Giovi third railway 
crossing and especially projects for southern Italy (the Naples - Bari high speed/capacity railway line and the 
doubling of the Palermo - Catania - Messina railway line).
