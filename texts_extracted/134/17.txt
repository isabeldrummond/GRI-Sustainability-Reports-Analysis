 
The environmental advantages of using Eco-design & Construction systems are measured by comparing them 
to environmental performances obtained using standard design and construction methods. The Group has found 
that green buildings generate lower environmental impacts of more than 30% and this is one of the reasons why 
the  Group's  projects  have  garnered  important  accolades  at  international  level  for  their  innovative  and 
environmental sustainability characteristics. 
 
Strategic pillars 
Given the complexity of global challenges and the competitive playing field, the Group has to be agile and 
dynamic, ready to pre-empt the market's needs before it is even aware of them and the related business 
opportunities.  
Accordingly, the Group has refreshed its organisational model significantly in recent years to ensure continuous 
improvement and a sharper focus on efficiency, innovation and responsible conduct. 
Efficiency 
This organisational overview has affected the entire Group, has had a profound impact on its internal culture 
and has required the active involvement of all levels of decision makers and operational resources. The objective 
was to ensure optimal management of all core processes, from commercial planning to the bidding and 
execution processes.  
The corporate competence centres ensure the application of best practices and the Group's guidelines by all 
subsidiaries as well as optimisation of operating competencies and synergies along the entire value chain.
