The international community has undertaken important initiatives to manage the changes underway, like the 
United Nations' 2030 Agenda (which includes the SDGs) for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate 
Agreement.   
Infrastructure directly and indirectly contributes to achievement of 92% of all the targets linked to the SGDs3. It 
is a fundamental part of the fight against climate change as it contributes more than 60% of the global GHG 
emissions4. 
Meeting the growing global demand for infrastructure and achievement of the SDGs require investments that 
can only increase over the next decades as shown in the next graph based on the Global Infrastructure Hub5 
estimates.
