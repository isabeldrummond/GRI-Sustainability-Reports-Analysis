On 21 October 2019, Salini Impregilo and Astaldi, together with Canadian and non-Canadian partners as 
members of the Mobilinx consortium, were awarded a civil construction contract worth €917 million (around 
CAD1.3 billion) by Infrastructure Ontario and Metrolinx for the Hurontario LRT (HuLRT). The complete Mobilinx 
team, which also consists of John Laing, Hitachi, Amico, Bot and Transdev, will design, build, finance and 
operate the HuLRT for a 30-year term. 
The HuLRT is an 18-kilometre, 19-stop light rail transit system, able to transport up to 14 million passengers a 
year, that runs along Hurontario Street from Port Credit in Mississauga to the Brampton Gateway Terminal. The 
HuLRT will operate in a separated guideway with traffic priority throughout most of the corridor. 
With a 42% stake in the joint venture for the civil construction work (€385 million), Salini Impregilo will lead the 
engineering, procurement and construction of the civil works. Astaldi has a 28% stake (for a value of 
approximately €257 million).
