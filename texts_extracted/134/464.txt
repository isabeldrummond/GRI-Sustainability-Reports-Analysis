€1.2 million (plus fines and interest). The notice refers to: (i) for a minimum part, the alleged incorrect 
application of transfer pricing rules to sureties provided free of charge on behalf of foreign subsidiaries, 
on which it should allegedly have charged commissions of €741 thousand; (ii) the alleged undue deduction 
of the “ACE relief” (Aid for Economic Growth) of €3,450 thousand contrary to the provisions of article 10 
of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance’s decree of 14 March 2012. At the date of preparation of this 
report, the deadline for presentation of an appeal has not expired. 
With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the company believes that it has 
acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. When it deemed it appropriate to 
settle the dispute, as explained earlier in more detail, it did so to avail of the various options provided for by the 
relevant legislation, such as the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes or the positions 
assigned to  the  tax collection  agency, the court-ordered settlement procedure and the mutually-agreed 
settlement procedure.
