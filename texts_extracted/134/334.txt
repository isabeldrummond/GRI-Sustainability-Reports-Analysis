After the 2013 IRES tax assessment and the 2013, 2014 and 2015 VAT audit, the Genoa tax office inspectors 
identified findings for IRES purposes for 2013 related to alleged undue deductions of €1.5 million for the use of 
the loss allowance and the alleged undue deduction of VAT of €332 thousand on costs incurred for the defence 
of managers and other employees in criminal court proceedings in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Fisia Ambiente 
appealed against these assessments in fact and in law with its comments and applications filed in accordance 
with article 12.7 of Law no. 212/2000. The tax authorities fully accepted the inspectors’ findings and notified two 
assessment notices for 2013, one for IRES and one for VAT. In turn, the subsidiary has filed reasoned requests 
for a mitigation hearing as per article 6 and following articles of Legislative decree no. 218/1997.  
The mutually-agreed settlement procedure for the VAT was not successful and, in June 2019, the company 
appealed to the competent tax commission commencing the relevant legal proceedings. At the date of 
preparation of this Annual Report, the competent tax commission has issued its ruling (i) partly accepting the 
company’s appeal for 2013, (ii) rejecting the appeal for 2014, and (iii) fully accepting its appeal for 2015 thereby 
cancelling the assessment notice. The term for presentation of an appeal in all cases has not yet expired. 
Negotiations for settlement of the assessed IRES were successful and the subsidiary paid the first of four 
instalments on 27 May 2019. 
With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the subsidiary believes that it has 
acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. When it deemed it appropriate to 
settle the dispute, as explained earlier in more detail, it did so to avail of the various options provided for by the 
relevant legislation, such as the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes or the positions 
assigned to  the tax collection  agency, the court-ordered settlement procedure and the mutually-agreed 
settlement procedure. 
 
Fibe 
FIBE has a pending dispute about the local property tax (ICI) on the Acerra waste-to-energy plant.  
In January 2013, the subsidiary received tax assessment notices from the Acerra municipality with respect to 
the waste-to-energy plant, which requested payment of local property tax and related penalties for approximately 
€14.3 million for the years 2009-2011. The amount requested by the municipality and challenged by Fibe was 
confirmed as far as its applicability but reduced in terms of its amount and penalties by the Naples Regional Tax 
Commission. 
The subsidiary appealed against the second level ruling with the Supreme Court and the case is still pending. 
However, in 2015, the subsidiary set aside a provision for an amount equal to the assessed tax plus accrued 
interest on a prudent basis. On 7 March 2018, Fibe applied for the procedure for the out-of-court settlement of 
the positions assigned to the collection agency as per article 1 of Decree law no. 148/2017 converted with 
modifications into Law no. 172/2017. 
The disputes about the following are still pending:
