11The data related to the consumption of energy in the month of December 2018, unless otherwise indicated, have been taken 
from the invoices from the suppliers. The data for the energy consumption of the companies located at the headquarters in 
Calenzano were estimated in part on the basis of the consumption in December of 2017. The consumption of fuel for motor 
vehicles  of  the  Italian  companies  in  Calenzano  and  part  of  those  related  to    Lasit  S.p.A.,  were  estimated  starting  with  the 
expense using the average annual price of gasoline and diesel (â‚¬/L) shown on the site o the Ministry of Economic Development.  
For the calculation of  the energy consumption in 2018 in GJ, we have used the conversion factors of the Department for Environment, 
Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), UK, 2018.
