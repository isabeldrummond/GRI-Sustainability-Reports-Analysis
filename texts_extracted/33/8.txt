Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018
LETTER TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS
Dear stakeholders,
We are proud to present the Consolidated Non-financial Statement (NFS) of 
the El.En. Group. This document is meant to allow you to know more about 
us and to evaluate our commitment, the objectives and results obtained in 
the area of social responsibility which includes taking care of our people, 
the quality of our products, the investments in research and development 
to improve the welfare of the human race, as well as the respect for the 
environment, for human rights and the fight against corruption; these values 
represent the fundamental basis for the daily management of our activities 
and the starting point for the planning of all the future initiatives.
Our attention to these issues was expressed even more clearly thanks to the 
approval of our first Sustainability Plan which defined the medium to long-
term goals of the Group, clarified the initiatives promoted in this field and 
represented an important demonstration to our stakeholders of the path we 
had taken.
Sustainability means creating value over time and being able to successfully 
meet  the  challenges  of  tomorrow;  we  believe  that  the  future  will  be 
open to those who will be able  to meet these challenges and assume 
the responsibility in terms of sustainability for the future generations by 
managing the changes and innovating with enthusiasm while remaining 
true to the values and principles which they have always honored.
This is what guides us every day in our business, makes us proud and urges 
us to improve continuously.
 
The President
Gabriele Clementi
