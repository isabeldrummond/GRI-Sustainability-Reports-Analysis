For the calculation of the Scope 1 emissions 2017 and 2018 we have considered respectively the emission factors of 
DEFRA 2017 and 2018. 
For the calculation of Scope 2 emissions we have used different factors based on the calculation methods of the 
different countries. In particular: 
• For the location-based method we have used average emission factors related to the generation of national energy 
for the different countries in which we operate as reported in the publication Confronti Internazionali, Terni 2015 and 
2016, respectively for 2017 and 2018;
• For the market-based method we used average emission factors derived from the production of electricity  in the 
EU for Italy, France and Germany, published in the document Residual Mix Results, Association of issuing bodies (AIB), 
2016 and 2017, respectively for 2017 and 2018. For the other countries we have used the same factors used for the 
location-based method."
12 It should be noted that for a better compliance with Standard GRI 305-1 for the calculation of Scope 1 emissions we used an up-dated source 
of the emission factors which reports the emissions in CO . The Scope 2 emissions on the other hand, are expressed in tons of CO, in any case, 
2eq 2
the percentage of methane and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on the total emissions of green-house gas (CO ), as can be seen from the 
2eq
technical literature to which they refer.  It should be noted that, following this improvement process of the reporting system for Scope 1 emissions 
and, in particular, the up-dating of the sources of the factors of emissions used for the calculation of the 2018 data , the data for 2017 have been 
restated with respect to those shown in the preceding NFD, using new emission factors. For the previously published data, please consult the NFD 
for  2017, which was published on the website www.elengroup.com. in the section called Investor Relations/Sustainability/Reports
