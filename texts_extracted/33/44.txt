Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018
FOCUS: THE RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS
The Group sustains and respects the rights of the individual in conformity with the Declaration of Human 
Rights of the United Nations and, consequently, requires the greatest respect for people and for the 
regulations that are applicable in relation to work; they do not tolerate any behavior that is discriminatory or 
threatens the safety of people. The Group considers impartial treatment to be a fundamental value in every 
relationship both within and outside of the company and believes that the individual, his/her ideologies and 
his/her rights are values which must be protected. The behavior of every employee and collaborator must be 
in conformity with the principles and regulations expressed in the Ethics Code and the legal and contractual 
rules that regulate labor relations regulations. By disseminating their own Ethics Code even to collaborators 
and suppliers the El.En. Group has established a safeguard aimed at guaranteeing the respect of human 
rights (prohibition of discrimination, prohibition of forced or child labor, free association) even in those areas 
that are held to be of the greatest potential risk in relation to these issues (for example, the supply chain).
