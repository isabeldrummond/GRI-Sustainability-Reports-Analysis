8The data related to energy consumption for the month of December 2018, unless otherwise indicated, were taken from the invoices issued by the 
suppliers of energy services. The data related to the energy consumption of the companies in Calenzano were in part estimated on the basis of the 
consumption for the month of December 2017. The consumption of fuel for the vehicles for the cars belonging to the Italian companies in Calenzano 
and part of those belonging to  Lasit S.p.A., were estimated, starting with the expense through the average annual price of gasoline and diesel fuel (€/L) 
found on the website of the Ministry of Economic Development. For the calculation of the energy consumption in 2018 in GJ we used the conversion 
factors of the Department for Environmental Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), UK, 2018".
