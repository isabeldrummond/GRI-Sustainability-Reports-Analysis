It should be noted that for a better compliance with Standard GRI 305-1 for the calculation of Scope 1 emissions we used an up-dated source of 
the emission factors which reports the emissions in CO2eq. The Scope 2 emissions on the other hand, are expressed in tons of CO2, in any case, the 
percentage of methane and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on the tota emissions of green-house gas (CO2eq), as can be seen from the technical 
literature to which they refer.  It should be noted that, following this improvement process of the reporting system for Scope 1 emissions and, in 
particular, the up-dating , of the sources of the factors of emissions used for the calculation of the 2018 data , the data for 2017 have been revised with 
respect to those shown in the preceding NFD, using new emission factors. For the previously published data, please consult the NFD for  2017, which 
was published on the website www.elengroup.com. in the sction called Investor Relations/Sustainability/Reports
