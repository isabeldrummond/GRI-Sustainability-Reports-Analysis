10For 2018 it was decided to proceed with the reporting of the data related to injuries using the new Standard GRI 403, published by the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) in 2018 which replaced the old version published in 2016 and used up until that time. For comparative purposes, the 
data related to 2017 have been revised with respect to those published earlier in the NFD after the up-dating of Standard GRI 403. The injury rate 
was calculated as the ratio between the total number of injuries and the total number of hours worked using a multiplying factor of 1.000.000. For 
the data published previously, please refer to the NFD 2017 published on the website www.elengroup.com in the section called Investor relations/
Sustainability/Reports.
