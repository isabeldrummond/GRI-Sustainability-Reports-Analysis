Alperia Sustainability Report 2019 
As you can see from reading this document, sustainability is a key value for us; together with innovation, it is 
the engine of inclusive and balanced growth. We have a deep conviction that a company like ours has a duty 
to make responsible environmental and social decisions, which have a positive  impact on the whole 
community. For this reason, and with renewed determination, we will continue to combine the principles of 
economic efficiency and sustainability, working responsibly for South Tyrol's present and future.
