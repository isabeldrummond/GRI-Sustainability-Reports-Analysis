Alperia Sustainability Report 2019 
 
We introduced a data-collection system relating to activities carried out by staff (e.g. hours worked) and an 
accident-reporting procedure. Out accident performance assessment is not limited to the Alperia Group, but 
also encompasses that of external companies working at our offices. The data collected is disseminated in-
house through the monthly HSE report. The contractual conditions also include specific clauses on employee 
health and safety. Work performance of contracting companies is assessed through a dedicated rating system. 
In 2019, the process of qualification and evaluation of suppliers was further perfected. According to collected 
data, 2 accidents occurred during the year, leading to 86 days of absence from work. This led to an increase 
in both the FI accident rate index for contracted companies, from 1,71 to 3,05 and the SI index on work 
absences, from 0,02 to 0,13.

Focus on employee health  
 
We want to create a healthy and wellness-focussed workplace for our employees. For this reason, we give 
each employee the opportunity to use part or all of their production bonus for benefits under a welfare 
programme (reimbursement of school expenses for a family member or reimbursement of expenses for 
assistance for dependent family members). We also provide them with supplementary health insurance and 
insurance against accidents at work and outside work in the event of permanent disability. Inside our offices, 
following suggestions received through the myIdeas tool for employees, we introduced glass water bottles, 
drinking water dispensers, free apples and sanitisers at office entrances and all bathrooms. We continue to 
support CRAL, which organises after-work social activities for our employees. We also renewed agreements 
with various sport centres in Bolzano and with other organisations in the area. The same factors were taken 
into account when designing the new Alperia headquarters in Merano, which will also be focussed on the well-
being of the people who use it on a daily basis, including by building in-house fitness and relaxation rooms.
