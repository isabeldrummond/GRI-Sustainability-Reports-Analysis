Alperia purchases made centrally are the responsibility of the Procurement Service which seeks, where 
possible, to favour local, green and socially responsible purchasing. 
 
In 2019, Alperia invested heavily in the search for sustainability in the purchasing process, integrating this 
requirement in its tenders. As for the origin of purchases, 62% of Alperia's 2019 purchase orders were to 
suppliers with residency in South Tyrol (60% in 2018). Working with local suppliers to the extent commercially 
possible is a way for Alperia to contribute to the local economy and make a solid contribution through its 
activities. In detail, the percentage of products and services purchased locally made up 35% (27% in 2018) of 
total expenses. Amongst these: 
  
-  origin of works suppliers: 42% local in 2019 (36% in 2018) 
-  origin of service suppliers: 39% local in 2019 (22% in 2018) 
-  origin of product suppliers: 18% local in 2019 (19% in 2018)
