1 Alperia Bartucci was not included in the 2018 data. Gruppo Green Power, Bluepower Connection Srl, Green Energy group, and Unix group Srl are not 
included in 2019 data. The total number of 2019 Alperia Group employees (with the exception of Bartucci) – equal to 970 – cannot be compared to the 
total number of employees indicated for 2018 – equal to 945 – net of employees leaving plus new hires in 2019, excluding Alperia Bartucci. The 
appropriate 2018 figure in order to make this comparison is 961, not 945. This misalignment is due to a different scope of reporting for 2019 compared 
to 2018 (entry of Alperia Sum and Alperia Trading) and a switch from the TPC to Zucchetti application (incorrect counting of terminated employees).  
2 Employees who left the organisation on 31.12 are not included in the total number of employees per 31.12. 
3 Directors are included in employee numbers. 
4 The percentages communicated in 2019 are calculated on total employees whereas in the 2018 Sustainability Report they were calculated on 
employment contract/type.

1 Gruppo Green Power, Bluepower Connection Srl, Green Energy Group, and Unix Group Srl are not included in 2019 data. The total number of 2019 
Alperia Group employees (with the exception of Bartucci) – equal to 970 – cannot be compared to the total number of employees indicated for 2018 – equal 
to 945 – net of employees leaving plus new hires in 2019, excluding Alperia Bartucci. The appropriate 2018 figure in order to make this comparison is 961, 
not 945. This misalignment is due to a different scope of reporting for 2019 compared to 2018 (entry of Alperia Sum and Alperia Trading) and a switch from 
the TPC to Zucchetti application (incorrect counting of terminated employees).  
 
 
Most of the group’s employees are subject to the provisions of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement 
for Employees in the Electricity Sector. At a local level, Alperia engages in dialogue with trade-union 
representatives in South Tyrol. In 2018 and 2019, it harmonised the contract conditions (relating to travel, 
availability,  meal  voucher  conditions,  supplementary  pension  fund,  energy  discount  for  retired  former 
employees and result bonuses) agreed upon by company directors and unions. 
 
Alperia focuses strongly on training. In 2019, there were 20.656 training hours carried out, mainly relating to 
digitalisation, MS Office courses – D3 courses, workplace safety, 231 legislation and soft skills (conflict 
management and time management). These are areas that will be further investigated in the coming years as 
they are considered essential for a modern company.
