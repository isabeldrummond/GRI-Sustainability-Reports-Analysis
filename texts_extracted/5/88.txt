Alperia Sustainability Report 2019 
Security figures  
 
In 2019, Alperia’s protection systems blocked an average of 4.000 spam emails and 6.000 malicious 
connection attempts every day, the latter falling by 73% compared to 2018. This reduction resulted from a 
change to the measurement paradigm: since 2019, only attempts to access Microsoft systems outside the 
Alperia (Bolzano office) perimeter are identified, avoiding the inclusion of user password errors. Spam emails, 
on the other hand, were up 33% compared to 2018 (around 1.000 more). This increase is the result of greater 
Cloud openness and new internet applications.  
 
Each month, Alperia identifies and blocks an average of:  
 
-  2.930 viruses: This figure is significantly higher than 2018 (70 viruses) resulting from two internally 
blocked episodes of targeted attacks over the course of two months. 
-  31 pieces of spyware (software that collects information about a user’s online activity): The figure 
went down 23% due to more efficient internal security systems and greater user awareness. 
-  2  million  malicious,  suspicious  or  prohibited  internet  use  incidents  (activities  related  to 
suspicious or prohibited browsing): exactly 100% more than in 2018, also here attributable to more 
open access/exposure to the cloud and new internet applications; 
-  200 malicious or unauthorised applications: a 67% increase compared to 2018, due to more open 
access/exposure to the cloud and new internet applications 
-  250.000 malicious or prohibited items of content: in line with 2018 numbers 
 
The figures show that the threat is constantly growing. Defence systems must always be up to date to ensure 
they are able to fight off attacks effectively, guaranteeing the necessary security for company systems.

Digitisation  
 
Alperia must complete its digital transformation in order to become a modern, fully efficient and intelligent 
company. This change will not only streamline daily activities, but also contribute significantly to reducing 
energy consumption. By increasing the interconnectivity of buildings, equipment, facilities and transport 
systems, digitisation offers advantages for energy efficiency that are clearly superior to analogue management. 
In addition, digital systems make it possible to analyse available data in order to make improvements and 
efficiencies in activity management. Alperia has an extensive plan for this process, supported by cutting-edge 
technology solutions, such as sensors, meters, distributed registers and interfaces. The group’s digitisation 
process is divided into twelve areas. Marketing was the first area to be completed in 2019, which will be 
followed by sales in 2020, with integration of the billing and accounting processes. We will then bring together 
the ERMs covering the corporate and Edyna worlds into a single application, to provide common procedures
