Alperia Sustainability Report 2019 
-  Community: Alperia is contributing to the Protection System for Asylum Seekers and Refugees 
(SPRAR) project, which provides facilities for asylum seekers and refugees in small housing units in 
South Tyrol by making two of its buildings available. The first is located in Barbiano, which welcomed 
17 people in March 2019 (a couple, a family with two small children and 11 single people, from Egypt, 
Libya, Morocco, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Ivory Coast). The target is to provide support for 
25 asylum seekers in total. The second is in Naturno, where Alperia Greenpower has given a building 
on lease to the Burgraviato District Community to use for the temporary reception of small immigrant 
communities. The lease is in place until 31 December 2020.
