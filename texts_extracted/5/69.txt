Risk of inadequate monitoring of energy  We want to reduce energy consumption in buildings and plants through 
consumption  and  energy-efficiency  targeted energy-efficiency initiatives. We also do this through Alperia Bartucci 
levels  of  buildings  and  systems  with  SpA, the ESCo that oversees the implementation of energy-efficiency projects

efficiency measures  group's Strategic Plan. Our objective is to use, wherever possible, renewable 
energy sources to run our plants and buildings. 
 
 
Alperia consumes energy directly and indirectly. Direct consumption includes the use of fuel for the production 
of electrical and thermal energy in plants (cogeneration, thermal power stations, boilers) as well as non-
renewable primary-energy flows not directly related to energy production (e.g. heating and transport fuels), 
used in carrying out activities. Indirect energy consumption relates to the energy that the group buys and uses 
for its plants and offices. This energy is partly self-produced, and the associated data are included in direct 
fuel consumption. If more energy is needed, Alperia purchases it from third parties and accounts for it in the 
group's indirect energy consumption. In 2019, Alperia's direct and indirect energy consumption – defined as 
that of the operating companies, customer offices and group's representative offices – amounted to around 
3.544 TJ. Of total energy consumption, 34% comes from non-renewable sources and 66% from renewable 
sources. In particular, among non-renewable sources, there was a significant increase (+117%) in the use of 
diesel fuel connected to heavy snowfall in November, which isolated many areas of South Tyrol. Among 
renewable sources, on the other hand, there was an increase in electricity for self-consumption (+61%) 
determined by more refined data measurements in 2019. In 2018, total energy consumption was 3.099 TJ, 
with 36% from non-renewable sources and 64% from renewable sources.

Alperia prefers to use energy from renewable sources, both in production and in its offices. Two out of five 
district heating systems have installed photovoltaic panels. Through Alperia Bartucci, it furthermore promotes 
the energy efficiency of buildings, plants and the entire system with a group-level reporting system and 
integrated management approach. During 2019, an audit was carried out at all locations, from which an energy-
efficiency intervention plan was defined which includes, among the various measures:  
 
-  replacement of fixtures and fittings in the Via Dodociville office in Bolzano (carried out in 2019) 
-  connection of Edyna to district heating (carried out in 2019)
