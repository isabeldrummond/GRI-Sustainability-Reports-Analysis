ELISA) and five are still in progress. Each project is executed and developed to achieve maximum added value 
for the company, region and customer. 
 
These activities are managed through a governance and control system with a dedicated budget of over 
€937.842 in 2019 (almost €600.000 more than in 2018), out of more than €100.560 invested in research and 
development. A periodic report follows up on the issues addressed, chosen because they were in line with the 
areas of interest defined in the 2017–2021 Strategic Plan. These activities are also the subject of a quarterly 
meeting with progress update.

Alperia is preparing group-wide innovation guidelines to support the Innovation Board's activities. The 
objectives of these guidelines is to systematise the group's innovation process, identifying criteria for finding 
innovative ideas, their selection, details on the prototyping and go-to-market process, specifying the chain of 
responsibility involved in the various projects, since these are interdisciplinary activities. 
 
We also launched Innovate, an intranet initiative where we asked our employees to come up with innovative 
ideas. Twelve ideas submitted through the system are now being assessed.  
 
 
UVAMs  
One of the peculiarities of electricity systems is the need to constantly guarantee that energy required by 
consumers as a whole is balanced with the energy produced by power plants. Terna is the operator of the 
Italian transmission grid, and thus guarantees this balance using a highly technical control system, through a 
dedicated market. In the past, there were a few large power plants that guaranteed energy supply on a national 
scale. But the growing expansion of renewable energy is leading to many changes for the Italian and European 
electricity grid. The system has been opened up to many small production, consumption and storage units, 
the flexibility of which contributes to stabilisation of the electricity grid. Because of this, we now deal with 
UVAMs (Mixed Enabled Virtual Units), or an aggregation of peripheral units of production, consumption and 
storage. The aggregated plants, connected to the Virtual Power Plant grid, provide reserve power to be used 
in the electricity grid should stability problems arise. Terna has established 15 aggregation zones, within which 
participants in the UVAM project must offer at least 1 MW of positive or negative reserve power. Alperia also 
took part in these tenders in 2019. The project, which was extremely challenging and carried out within the 
Innovation Board, involved building a sophisticated IT system to allow the data recorded at some of its plants 
to be submitted online through dedicated sensors. In addition, the district heating plant in Bolzano was 
successfully connected. The pilot phase, which has now officially ended, brought the project directly to market, 
with the intention of introducing other production and consumption units in 2020. 
 
In relation to the financial regulation of UVAMs, the system provides, in addition to the ordinary revenues linked 
to activated energy (€/MWh), the revenue of resource availability (fixed fee, €/MW).  
 
Currently in Italy, UVAMs are enabled to provide services such as congestion resolution, balancing and tertiary 
reserves, but Terna's intention is to test how UVAMs can be used for other services (such as secondary 
frequency/power regulation) and to also involve consumers in the tertiary and/or domestic sector. Indeed, UVAMs 
are considered fundamental to the redesign of the service market, with a view to a full energy transition. It should
