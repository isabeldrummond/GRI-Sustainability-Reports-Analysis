Another very important issue to be addressed is the gender pay gap between men and women. The gap is 5% 
for office workers, but rises to 31% for the top management category. Only in middle management do women 
earn on average 3% more than their male colleagues. Furthermore, the numbers of women in executive and 
management positions increased compared to the previous year. In top management, the percentage went 
from 12% in 2018 to 19% in 2019. In middle management, the percentage of new second- and third-level 
managers rose from 15% to 17%. In relation to average age, 36% of the group's workforce is over 51 years 
old, equal to 371 employees. As previously mentioned, succession planning is one of the most important 
challenges facing Alperia.
