Alperia Sustainability Report 2019 
For Alperia SpA, Alperia Smart Services and Alperia Trading, an Italian e-learning platform on the 231 Model 
was also set up and is already available to employees; the German platform will be available soon. The same 
activity is also under way for Alperia Ecoplus. 
 
Finally, an IT dashboard will be made available to managers where staff reporting data can be consulted (e.g. 
overtime, holidays, illnesses, etc.). This tool will allow management and HR management to improve personnel 
management.

Talent and Pillars: the evolution of leadership and staff {GRI 404-2, 404-3, GRI 401-1} 
  
One of the greatest risks for Alperia is its ageing workforce. As more staff get closer to retirement, it is essential 
to develop an effective succession plan. This is an objective the group is pursuing with a series of joint 
activities. In addition to continuous learning activities, plans for the group’s Talent, or high performers, and 
Pillars are being developed. In 2019, there were 67 employees up to age 42 who either applied to participate 
in the Talent project or were nominated by their managers. Thirty were selected and underwent an assessment 
stage. Factors considered included: motivation, commitment, above-average willingness to learn, propensity 
to role change, assumption of responsibility, loyalty to the company and willingness to learn in other languages. 
The assessment included individual interviews and psychometric tests. This led to the selection of a class of 
High Performers who would take part in individual development programmes. Alongside them are a group of 
ten others defined as Alperia Pillars, with higher skill levels than the Talent group. The assessment plan for 
these individuals will begin in 2020, and specific development plans will also be defined for them. The 
objectives are:  
 
-  to contribute to the personal development of interested parties 
-  to map out a possible career path 
-  to motivate employees  
 
Motivation is a key factor for employees. As such, it is an area where Alperia will continue to invest heavily 
and link to sustainability. In 2020, the MBO scheme was also changed to include individual sustainability 
objectives for all executives.  
 
At the end of 2019, Alperia also launched a corporate-climate survey carried out with the Great Place to Work® 
Institute Italia. The goal was to increase employee satisfaction by 3%, from 41% to 43%. This goal was largely 
achieved, given that the group achieved a Trust Index level of 50%. The feedback interviews organised by 
Human Resources for all business units were also extended. In 2019, career-development plans were agreed 
upon with 19% of the staff within the first level of the reporting structure and with 16% of those in the second 
and third. Related development plans were also implemented. Compared to 2018, this number fell in 
percentage terms, even though there were 26 actual agreed-upon plans in 2019, and 16 in 2018. This 
percentage reduction was due to a growth in manager numbers due to the addition of the Alperia Bartucci
