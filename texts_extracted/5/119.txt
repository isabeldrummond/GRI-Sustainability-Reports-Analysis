-  Smart Land: Alperia has developed an experimental project with the Laimburg Research Centre, 
leading to the installation of intelligent soil moisture sensors to make the irrigation process more 
efficient. The system has good potential in terms of water savings and will bring significant reductions 
in CO  emissions, since the water pumps are powered by diesel generators. According to estimates, 
2
savings could exceed 50% for both water and CO . In 2020, the project will continue with marketing

of the sensors.
