Alperia is South Tyrolâ€™s leading energy service provider and one of the most important sustainable-energy 
companies in Italy. Nature is our primary source of inspiration. We work in harmony with the local community 
and encourage the development of South Tyrol as a green region.  
 
The energy we produce comes from renewable sources, mainly hydroelectric. We hold the majority of shares 
in 34 hydroelectric plants, which are accompanied by seven photovoltaic plants and three parks, five district 
heating plants and one biomass plant in Ottana, Sardinia. We also manage an 8.736 km electricity distribution 
grid. Besides this, we sell energy, build renewable power plants, develop electric mobility and provide the 
benefits of internet connectivity services. With our vast experience and the know-how of our experts, we are 
able to offer innovative energy-efficiency solutions. Our commitment to making sustainability a strategic driver 
for short- and long-term operations is all-encompassing.  
 
Alperia SpA is a joint-stock parent company created on 1 January 2016 from the merger of the two largest 
energy companies in the province of Bolzano. The Autonomous Province of Bolzano currently holds 46,38% 
of the company. Selfin, which is owned by 100 municipalities in South Tyrol, holds 11,62%; the municipalities 
of Bolzano and Merano each hold 21% of the shares. The head office is in Bolzano; there are other operational 
offices in South Tyrol and elsewhere in Italy.
