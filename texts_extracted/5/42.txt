Alperia Sustainability Report 2019 
 
Social responsibility  
 
In 2019, Alperia again earmarked €100.000 for charitable donations. The Management Board chose recipients 
at two different points during the year. At Christmas, employees gave up their company gifts, providing South 
Tyrolean associations and organisations with €25.000 in total. The employees themselves nominated the 
charities to receive donations. Among the 50 nominated, management selected the following four associations, 
which had never before received support from Alperia:  
 
-  Puppy Walker ODV (www.puppywalkerselvazzano.it): selects, raises and trains guide dogs for the 
blind and assistance dogs for various types of disability, such as diabetic alert dogs, those for autistic 
people or for those with motor disabilities 
-  Fondazione IEO-CCM: supports research by the European Institute of Oncology and Cardiology 
Centre 
-  Onlus Kinderkrebshilfe Südtirol Regenbogen: provides support for minors affected by tumour 
pathologies and their families (kinderkrebshilfe.it) 
-  Tierheim Obervintl (Animal shelter in Vandoies): provides shelter and care for abandoned, stray or 
sick pets (www.tierheim-obervintl.it) 
 
The associations thanked Alperia and its employees for the donations, which enabled them to support various 
voluntary initiatives.  
 
 
Investment in infrastructure {GRI 203-1}  
 
To ensure a safe and reliable energy supply, we continued with our investment programme for infrastructure 
modernisation in 2019. Alperia has planned investments of €400 million over a five-year period, to make our 
infrastructure more resilient and reliable, even in the event of an emergency or disruption. In 2019, €104 million 
was invested. This figure follows the €216 million invested over the previous three years. Of these funds, 40% 
was invested in distribution networks; 28% in production; 13% in district heating; 9% in the Smart Region and 
10% in IT infrastructure, facilities, supply and trading and other areas.
