Close to our customers  {ALP1, ALP2}  
 
Being close to customers means communicating with them in a transparent, efficient and reliable way. Alperia 
engages with its customers through the www.alperia.eu website, which can also be accessed via apps and 
contains all sustainability information. There is also a call centre and nine Energy Points: three in Bolzano, two 
in Merano, one in Ora, one in Ortisei, one in Brunico and one in Bressanone. Customers can use the website 
or app to check how many people are waiting at each Energy Point, in order to reduce their waiting time. 
Alperia also has a toll-free phone number, which is active at least 35 hours a week and subject to service-
quality criteria imposed by the authority (ARERA).  
 
The Alperia call centre has bilingual workers who answer customer inquiries from Monday to Thursday, from 
8 a.m. to 4 p.m., and on Friday from 8 a.m. to 12 noon. The authority requires an 85% monthly response rate 
for calls received. Alperia has far exceeded this percentage, effectively responding to 97% of calls received 
every month. Performance in complaints management was equally positive: Alperia deals with and resolves 
them within ten days, even though legislation requires only that the company respond within 30 days . The 
goal is to improve even further by increasing monthly call-response rates to 100% and reducing complaint 
handling to seven days. For this reason, Alperia has renewed its partnership with an external call centre to 
cover peak call periods. Furthermore, Alperia promotes training days for front-office staff to maintain service 
quality, and provides them with the myRetail service available in the myAlperia space.  
 
One project dedicated to customer satisfaction stands out among the Innovation Board’s 2019 projects: the 
implementation of ELISA, a chatbot capable of learning independently and interacting with customers fully and 
efficiently. ELISA is a useful tool for freeing up staff while continuing to ensure the highest service quality.  
 
As required by law, Alperia monitors and classifies complaints received. There were 403 complaints registered 
in 2019, down from 533 in 2018. They were divided according to the reference categories envisaged by the 
legislation: contracts, arrears and line suspension, market, billing, measurement, connections, works and 
technical quality, social bonus, commercial quality and more. In 2019, 40% of complaints fell into the billing 
category. No complaints were escalated to the conciliation service. The next customer satisfaction survey on 
Alperia’s service will be carried out in 2020. These surveys are carried out every two years. In 2018, Alperia 
had an 87,2% satisfaction rate.
