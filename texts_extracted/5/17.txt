Alperia Sustainability Report 2019 
-  Green Mission: We keep environmental impact to a minimum and promote low-emission energy 
production,  the  implementation  of  programmes  for  protecting  biodiversity,  the  prevention  of 
contamination and the proper disposal of the waste produced. We strive to use water resources 
rationally and sustainably to manage the risks associated with water scarcity. All energy is used in a 
responsible manner, supporting measures designed to save energy and ensure that the latter is used 
efficiently. 
 
-  Customers: We work to build customer relationships that are based on trust. They can always reach 
us, and we are able to offer tailored energy products with attentive and solution-oriented customer 
service, taking advantage of the opportunities that the market presents and choosing to offer 
sustainable products and services. To all this, we add transparent, up-to-date and stakeholder-
oriented communications and marketing activity, with a focus on social and ecological issues. 
Comprehensive data protection and compliance with current privacy and security regulations are 
guaranteed at all times. 
 
-  Personnel: We pursue responsible human-resource management through open and transparent 
communication, continuous staff training in line with individual skills, the creation of a family-friendly 
environment for both man and women, as well as the promotion of diversity and equal opportunity in 
all activities. Employee health is of central importance to Alperia, and we thus guarantee the maximum 
level of work safety for staff and contractors alike.
