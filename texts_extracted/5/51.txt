Alperia Sustainability Report 2019 
  
To limit inefficiencies, Edyna has: 
 
-  improved the quality of the distribution service and modernised the grid infrastructure 
-  started remote control on 92 secondary substations already in service and newly built 
-  continued with high- and medium-voltage connections, through the installation of three primary 
substations 
-  merged the medium- and high-voltage grid in Laives 
-  continued to bury power lines, currently equal to 71% of the grid, reducing environmental impact and 
improving the grid’s resilience. In detail, Edyna now has:  
o  Edyna low voltage: 5.169 km – of which 78 are underground  
o  Edyna medium voltage: 3.315 km – of which 65 are underground  
o  Edyna high voltage: 252 km – of which 8 are underground
