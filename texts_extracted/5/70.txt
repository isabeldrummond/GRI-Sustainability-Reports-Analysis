Alperia Sustainability Report 2019 
-  renovation of two Edyna lighting towers and the car park (carried out in 2019) 
-  implementation of an ISO 50001 system 
-  installation of energy-efficient motors (in 2021 the complete replacement of pumps for two production 
groups and in 2022 the complete replacement of pumps for three production groups) 
-  installation of LED bulbs 
-  replacement of a tunnel fan at the Bressanone plant (scheduled for 2021â€“2022) 
-  installation of an advanced control system for thermal generation and on biomass boilers 
-  review of the control logic of the heating and cooling system 
-  reduction of losses with elevator transformers and potential heat recovery (one transformer is 
already in service, a second transformer will be replaced in early 2020, and a third transformer will 
be replaced by 2021) 
-  assessment for the replacement of oil and electric boilers (in 2020) 
-  other measures still being studied 
 
Once the potential for energy savings has been identified, we will proceed with carrying out the requirements 
set forth in Legislative Decree 102/2014 Energy Diagnosis Obligation and send the diagnostic data to ENEA.  
Alperia also obtained UNI 11352 certification, which verifies the results achieved in terms of energy savings 
by companies that provide energy services to the industrial sector. 
 
Alperia also has two storage tanks, one in Sesto and the other in Bolzano. The Bolzano tank has a capacity 
of  5.800  m3  and  uses  thermal  energy  from the  local  municipal  solid  waste  incinerator,  reducing  the 
consumption of fossil fuels and CO  emissions in the city. Alperia has achieved savings of 11.000 tonnes of 
2
CO  in this way since 2015 (up to 5.000 in 2018), using energy from secondary raw materials (waste). It should 
2
be noted that changes compared to the previous year are due to data-collection refinement, which has given 
a broader and more complete overview.
