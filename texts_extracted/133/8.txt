-  Importance for VIVIDA: concerning activities performed, impacts (economic, environmental and 
social) and availability of information

The process to identify the relevant contents for our sustainability report was based on the following steps: 
Identification: we considered aspects and impacts deriving from our daily activities and then we distinguished 
between activities performed, services distributed, and relations with stakeholders. Every individuated aspect 
and impact has been assessed for the effects produced within and outside our organization (environments 
and people). 
Selection: we restricted the first analysis to aspects and effects considered to be material according the 
quantitative and qualitative approach previously described. From the first group of aspects and indicators, we 
selected the releva(cid:374)t o(cid:374)es i(cid:374) ter(cid:373)s of co(cid:374)te(cid:374)t for the orga(cid:374)izatio(cid:374) a(cid:374)d i(cid:374) ter(cid:373)s of stakeholdersâ€™ expectatio(cid:374)s.       
Validation: we critically reviewed the selection of material aspects and indicators to provide an appropriate 
representation of our ability of operating in a sustainable way, including both positive and negative aspects of 
our activity. 
Re-examination: our objective is to re-examine, after the publication of this document, the information 
provided to adjust material aspects and indicators to the evolution of our strategy. A key aspect of this 
updating process is the critical review of the internal process of stakeholder engagement. This will encourage 
us to update, from 2018 onwards, the internal process of stakeholder engagement with the aim of 
intercepting new clues. 
This process (as described above) allowed us to build our sustainability report, aware that this is just the 
starting point of a process that is going to be improved in the following years.
