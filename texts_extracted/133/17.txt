started a curricular internship in February 2018. 
I(cid:374) VIVIDA(cid:859)s (cid:448)isio(cid:374), the suppo(cid:396)t to i(cid:374)itiati(cid:448)es/people/Institutions should not become either an economic 
dependency or a tie, rather it should be a stimulus. We are convinced that whatever mean of contribution, 
economic or effective, should be addressed to create additional value and, therefore, support growth. Only 
when these conditions are in place, we are ready to get in the game. 
 
b)  2018-2019 objectives 
Figured out what emerged in 2017 and verified our alignment towards the 3 Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) before mentioned, we list in the following chart our main objectives in the short run: 
Even though VIVIDA is a small company, we aim at defining the guidelines 
that characterise our conduct - 2018. 
 
We will find an efficient alternative to water plastic bottles to reduce the 
quantity of PET – 2018.  
 
We commit ourselves to adopting solutions for a greener mobility for

emissions – 2018.  
 
We will try to introduce a monitoring system for waste production inside 
the office – 2018/2019. 
 
We aim at creating a welfare plan for all employees, because we would 
like to offer them additional tools for nourishing their attitudes and 
ambitions, for satisfying their desires or necessities – 2019. 
 
 
7.  APPENDIX 
a)  Methodological note 
We decided to apply reporting standards universally recognized to ease the comparison between our Report 
with that of other companies, national and international. For this reason, we applied Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) guidelines. 
In 2016, GRI published updated (cid:862)“ustai(cid:374)a(cid:271)ilit(cid:455) ‘epo(cid:396)ti(cid:374)g “ta(cid:374)da(cid:396)d(cid:863) (cid:449)hi(cid:272)h (cid:396)epla(cid:272)ed G4(cid:859)s guideli(cid:374)es. These 
standards can be applied following three different approaches: core, comprehensive or GRI – referenced.   
Considering the complexity of our company, its dimensions and our possibility to collect the information, we 
decided to adopt the (cid:862)(cid:272)o(cid:396)e(cid:863) app(cid:396)oa(cid:272)h, defi(cid:374)ed (cid:271)(cid:455) G‘I as follow: 
(cid:862)The Core option contains the essential elements of a sustainability report. The Core option provides the 
background against which an organization communicates the impacts of its economic, environmental and social 
and governance performance(cid:863). 
New standards guidelines have been re-organised in a modular structure with Universal Standards and Topic-
Specific Standards, linked one another. The three Universal Standards introduce the reporting principles and
