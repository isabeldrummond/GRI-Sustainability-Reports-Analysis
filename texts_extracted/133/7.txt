VIVIDA(cid:859)s (cid:374)et(cid:449)o(cid:396)k is composed by both small and big enterprises that require constant support and 
assistance. Our projects are complex, and they need a constant presence.

Given the complexity of the business contest, we are aware that (cid:373)eeti(cid:374)g (cid:272)lie(cid:374)ts(cid:859) (cid:374)eeds just by ourselves is 
increasingly more difficult. For this reason, we have developed strong professional relationships to ensure an 
appropriate and complete service in challenging engagements too when our competences are not enough.

Suppliers 
Also, in the supplie(cid:396)(cid:859)s selection process, VIVIDA considers that the careful and the respect towards the 
environment and our society are fundamental parameters. For this reason, when possible, we select 
suppliers that come from close areas, that care about the quality of the products and that minimize their 
environmental and social impact. 
The community 
We often work far from our Headquarters, but we are an entrepreneurial reality that cares and lives in its 
local community. The community is a fundamental stakeholder for VIVIDA and, when possible, we are proud 
of helping institutions, schools and universities, associations. 
Banks 
VIVIDA(cid:859)s set up was supported by Banca Etica, with which we share values and projects. Thanks to our 
common vision, we have built a strong and lasting relation, that is going to create mutual value.

d)  Materiality and Disclosure Management Approach 
Because of what previously communicated, the Materiality A(cid:374)al(cid:455)sis has (cid:271)ee(cid:374) do(cid:374)e (cid:862)i(cid:374)te(cid:396)(cid:374)all(cid:455)(cid:863) a(cid:374)d it has 
allowed us to identify the relevant aspects that represent our current organization.  
The Materiality Principle says that a sustainability report should include only relevant aspects (that means 
aspects which reflect significant impacts concerning economic, environmental and social fields) which 
i(cid:374)flue(cid:374)(cid:272)e stakeholde(cid:396)s(cid:859) de(cid:272)isio(cid:374)s. This selection can be done through the materiality analysis, which allows 
to identify material aspects to include in the report.
