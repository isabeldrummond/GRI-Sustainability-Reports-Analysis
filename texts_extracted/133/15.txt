b)  Energy consumption 
Our energy consumption is limited to the use of working places. We only use electricity for turning on lights 
and electronic devices while, only in winter, natural gas for heating the offices. To ease comparisons 
between the different resources, we transformed the quantitative data in metric tons of CO  equivalent.

For what concerns electricity, in 2017 we have consumed 1.037 kWh, which correspond to 0,72    
metric tons of CO  equivalent.

For what concerns natural gas, in 2017 we have consumed 1.344 smc, which correspond to 2,8 
metric tons of CO  equivalent.

In conclusion, our emissions are both direct and indirect: the first ones (Scope 1) are related to fuel 
consumption (natural gas, LPG, oil) therefore they include heating and commuting (driving from home to 
(cid:449)o(cid:396)k o(cid:396) to (cid:272)lie(cid:374)ts(cid:859) offi(cid:272)es(cid:895); the second ones (Scope 2) are related to electricity consumption. Therefore, we 
can resume the overall quantity of CO emissions as follow:

GHG EMISSIONS  QUANTITY  2017 TONS OF CO2 
Indirect GHG Emissions – Scope 1     
•  Natural gas  1.344 smc  2,80 
•  Transportation  104.925 km  9,50 
Direct GHG Emissions – Scope 2     
•  Electricity  1.937 kWh  0,72 
TOTAL  13,02 
 
c)  Water, paper and… 
We care about the quantity and the quality of consumable materials that we use in our daily activities. When 
possible, we select suppliers who respect environmental and social parameters.  
Here we explain the requirements that we take into consideration and that influence our decisions in the 
supplier selection process: 
 Geographic location: areas close to the place where we work. 
The furniture in our office is realized, in part, by local artisans that, thanks to the high quality of their 
manufacture, gave to the spaces a peculiar aspect. When possible, we try to prefer geographic proximity also 
for the selection of services (for example, computer assistance, electricians and carpenters) with the aim of 
reducing GHG emissions, a natural consequence of trucking.  
Ecological and sustainable materials: pvc-free, recyclable or created with reused materials. 
Concerning the selection of stationery, dishes, toilet paper and kitchen towels, we verify that they are 
produced with reused or recyclable materials.
