-  Employees: their value approximatively represents a quarter of VIVIDA(cid:859)s EVG&D. We know it is not 
enough. We are growing in terms of professionality and complexity and our objective is to achieve 
the 50% of the average value produced. Obviously, this ambitious objective, that becomes reality 
through economic recognition and e(cid:373)plo(cid:455)ee(cid:859)s (cid:449)elfa(cid:396)e pla(cid:374)s, will be possible in the medium term, 
after the achievement of expected revenues results. 
-  Partners: our policy is to store dividends. Our achieved net result represents a value that we will 
invest in the growth of VIVIDA and its people. Today, after nearly 4 years of business, we started 
thinking about the development of VIVIDA in the next future. In the following years, these thoughts 
and reflections will be translated in a development project, not only from a dimensional point of 
view, but also from a cultural one.  
-  Depreciation and amortization: it represents the dimension of investments started in April 2016, 
when we moved to our new office in Via Verdi 23. Now, spaces are big enough to host a Team of 
8/10 professionals and, first, we wanted them to stay in a comfortable and pleasant space, rather 
than a place where employees just work, considering that we spent there most of our time.

In pursuing this objective, we are inspired by the Precautionary Principle4, as promoted by the United 
Nations. From our vision, this Principle means finding solutions as soon as we understand the potential 
negative impact of our activity. This Principle helps us in mitigating and solving our impacts, where possible. 
It is an approach that we use also with our clients and employees. 
With this first sustainability report, we started to monitor our environmental footprint and outline our 
approach towards the environment. The reported results represent our point of departure, that will help us 
to progressively i(cid:373)p(cid:396)o(cid:448)e a(cid:374)d fi(cid:374)d ou(cid:396) (cid:373)ost "sustai(cid:374)a(cid:271)le path(cid:863), allowing us to reduce our environmental
