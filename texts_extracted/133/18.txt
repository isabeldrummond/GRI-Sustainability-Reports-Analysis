explain how to create a sustainability report (GRI 101 – Foundation); they provide information regarding the 
organization and its reporting practices (GRI 102 – General Disclosure) and explain why the topic is material 
with its impacts (GRI 103 – Management Approach). 
The application of the Materiality Principle, stated by GRI 101, allows to identify the topics with the most 
important impacts and which are relevant for stakeholders, therefore it helps in the selection of material 
Topic-Specific Standards for the organization. They cover economic impacts (200 Series – Economic Topics), 
environmental impacts (300 Series – Environmental Topics) and social impacts (400 Series – Social Topics). 
The featu(cid:396)e of (cid:862)Mate(cid:396)ialit(cid:455)(cid:863) (cid:373)ust (cid:271)e applied to the (cid:272)o(cid:374)te(cid:374)t and to the quality of information included in the 
report.  
More precisely, to define the content of our sustainability report, we considered the following principles: 
-  Stakeholder inclusiveness: the reporting organization shall identify its stakeholders and explain how it 
has responded to their reasonable expectations and interests.  
-  Sustainability context: the (cid:396)epo(cid:396)t shall p(cid:396)ese(cid:374)t the (cid:396)epo(cid:396)ti(cid:374)g o(cid:396)ga(cid:374)izatio(cid:374)(cid:859)s pe(cid:396)fo(cid:396)(cid:373)a(cid:374)(cid:272)e i(cid:374) the (cid:449)ide(cid:396) 
context of sustainability. 
-  Materiality: the report shall cover topics that (cid:396)efle(cid:272)t the (cid:396)epo(cid:396)ti(cid:374)g o(cid:396)ga(cid:374)izatio(cid:374)(cid:859)s sig(cid:374)ifi(cid:272)a(cid:374)t 
economic, environmental, and social impacts; or substantively influence the assessments and 
decisions of stakeholders. 
-  Completeness: the report shall include coverage of material topics and their Boundaries, sufficient to 
reflect significant economic, environmental, and social impacts, and to enable stakeholders to assess 
the (cid:396)epo(cid:396)ti(cid:374)g o(cid:396)ga(cid:374)izatio(cid:374)(cid:859)s pe(cid:396)fo(cid:396)(cid:373)a(cid:374)(cid:272)e i(cid:374) the (cid:396)epo(cid:396)ti(cid:374)g pe(cid:396)iod.  
To define the quality of the reported information, we considered the following principles: 
-  Accuracy: the reported information shall be sufficiently accurate and detailed for stakeholders to 
assess the (cid:396)epo(cid:396)ti(cid:374)g o(cid:396)ga(cid:374)izatio(cid:374)(cid:859)s pe(cid:396)fo(cid:396)(cid:373)a(cid:374)(cid:272)e.  
-  Balance: the reported information shall reflect positive and negative aspects of the reporting 
o(cid:396)ga(cid:374)izatio(cid:374)(cid:859)s pe(cid:396)fo(cid:396)(cid:373)a(cid:374)(cid:272)e to e(cid:374)a(cid:271)le a (cid:396)easo(cid:374)ed assess(cid:373)e(cid:374)t of o(cid:448)e(cid:396)all pe(cid:396)fo(cid:396)(cid:373)a(cid:374)(cid:272)e.  
-  Clarity: the reporting organization shall make information available in a manner that is 
understandable and accessible to stakeholders using that information.  
-  Comparability: the reporting organization shall select, compile, and report information consistently. 
The reported information shall be presented in a manner that enables stakeholders to analyse 
(cid:272)ha(cid:374)ges i(cid:374) the o(cid:396)ga(cid:374)izatio(cid:374)(cid:859)s pe(cid:396)fo(cid:396)(cid:373)a(cid:374)(cid:272)e o(cid:448)e(cid:396) ti(cid:373)e, a(cid:374)d that (cid:272)ould suppo(cid:396)t analysis relative to 
other organizations.  
-  Reliability: the reporting organization shall gather, record, compile, analyze, and report information 
and processes used in the preparation of the report in a way that they can be subject to 
examination, and that establishes the quality and materiality of the information. 
-  Timeliness: the reporting organization shall report on a regular schedule so that information is 
available in time for stakeholders to make informed decisions. 
Exceptions 
Being our first sustainability report, there are neither (cid:862)(cid:396)estate(cid:373)e(cid:374)t(cid:863) of i(cid:374)fo(cid:396)(cid:373)atio(cid:374) provided in the previous 
years, nor variations concerning relevant aspects to report. 
The frequency of reporting and updating of the document is annual. 2017 sustainability report is not submitted 
to external independent assurance.
