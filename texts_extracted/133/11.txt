The applied National Collective Agreement pertains to the Service Sector and, given the young age of the 
Team, we do not have different contractual frameworks given the lack of managers and executives in our 
current organogram. 
In 2017, besides the ordinary retribution, Euros 7 thousand were distributed concerning 2016 targets 
(approximately 4% of (cid:1006)(cid:1004)(cid:1005)(cid:1010)(cid:859)s revenues) and our (cid:1006)(cid:1004)(cid:1005)(cid:1011)(cid:859)s target amounted to Euros 4 thousand (approximately 
2% of 2017(cid:859)s revenues) which will be distributed in 2018. The difference in terms of amount and effects on 
revenues, between the two fiscal years, depends on 2017 turnover and on revenue increase from 2016 to 
2017. 
The variable compensation scheme (which is linked to individual and business results) that is currently in 
place, is divided in the following pillars: 
-  Production premium: is equal to a % of a target turnover; 
-  Market performance premium: measured on the contribute that every member of the Team realises 
for the acquisition of new clients and or consulting agreements; 
-  Personal performance premium: is equal to a variable amount and linked to the achievement of 
different objectives that have been assigned in the previous year.  
This scheme, which has been set up since the beginning of the Company, is going to be modified in 2019 due 
to the introduction of a welfare system aimed at rewarding employees with plans that better meet their 
attitudes and needs, without restricting premiums to a mere economic amount. We are convinced that the

Today VIVIDA is managed by a sole Director; we aim to change the governance structure within 2020, 
creating a Board of Directors that better represents gender equality among its members. 
Occupational health and safety are fundamental subjects for the proper management of a company. From 
some years, this concept has become wider and now it includes psychophysical well-being, whose indicators 
are: low absenteeism and low injury-rate, few overtime hours, low turnover-rate and long permanency in 
the Company. 
Being a consulting firm, the risk of occupational injuries is low. Additionally, we carry out regular monitoring 
activities of our working conditions, complying with normative standards and applied laws (Italy Legislative 
Decree April 9th, (cid:1006)(cid:1004)(cid:1004)(cid:1012) (cid:374). (cid:1012)(cid:1005) (cid:862)Testo Unico di salute e sicurezza sul lavoro(cid:863)(cid:895). I(cid:374) suppo(cid:396)t of this, VIVIDA is (cid:374)ot 
exposed to the risk of occupational disease and there was no event of work-related injury accident in 2017. 
Absentee rate3 is 4,1%, which corresponds to 9 lost days because of illnesses. Days of parental leave have 
been 32. There is any lost day because of strike or permit for Trade Unions duties. Overtime hours up to 31st 
December 2017 are 14, less than 1% of total worked hours.
