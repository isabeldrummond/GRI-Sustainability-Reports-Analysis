1.  OUR FIRST SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 
Many times, I have heard people saying, (cid:862)We a(cid:396)e (cid:374)ot as (cid:271)ig a(cid:374)d o(cid:396)ga(cid:374)ized to sta(cid:396)t a sustai(cid:374)a(cid:271)ilit(cid:455) p(cid:396)oje(cid:272)t(cid:863) o(cid:396) 
(cid:862)Wh(cid:455) should (cid:449)e do it?(cid:863). It is difficult to find a convincing answer to these objections, especially when 
(cid:373)a(cid:374)age(cid:396)s(cid:859) ho(cid:396)izo(cid:374) is li(cid:373)ited a(cid:374)d they are unable to understand the opportunities that a transparent report 
can offer. I am referring to strategical opportunities or chances to increase the overall portion of shared 
value.   
For this reason, few years after our foundation, we thought it was the moment to start our sustainability 
journey, convinced that it is going to help us in setting our medium and long-term goals, with more 
awareness and focus. 
VIVIDA(cid:859)s sustai(cid:374)a(cid:271)ilit(cid:455) (cid:396)epo(cid:396)t (cid:396)ep(cid:396)ese(cid:374)ts, i(cid:374) (cid:373)(cid:455) opinion, an experience from which everyone can learn 
something, in fact, everyone can write his or her own sustainability report given that we all use resources 
and give back the effects from their usage. 
Knowing how your own company operates is fundamental: this awareness allows you to understand the 
impacts, both positive and negative, that it may have towards the society and the environment. Nowadays, 
(cid:271)ei(cid:374)g (cid:862)t(cid:396)a(cid:374)spa(cid:396)e(cid:374)t(cid:863) a(cid:374)d e(cid:454)plai(cid:374)i(cid:374)g ho(cid:449) a(cid:374) o(cid:396)ga(cid:374)izatio(cid:374) p(cid:396)odu(cid:272)es so(cid:272)ial (cid:271)e(cid:374)efits (cid:894)i(cid:374)te(cid:396)(cid:374)al a(cid:374)d external) is an 
increasingly more urgent and current issue.  The sustainability report is a tool for setting medium and long-
term actions, it facilitates the contact with the external reality and gives to the organization a better 
perception of the impacts of its activities. 
Thanks to the sustainability report, we can finally start our journey, with the aim of setting challenging goals, 
but always considering our dimension and complexity, with the certainty that this exercise will enrich our 
experience during the time. 
For us, the (cid:449)illi(cid:374)g(cid:374)ess of (cid:271)ei(cid:374)g (cid:862)(cid:396)espo(cid:374)si(cid:271)le(cid:863) is (cid:374)ot o(cid:374)l(cid:455) a (cid:862)manifesto(cid:863) or a good intention, but it is a 
coherent conduct embedded in the whole Team.
