4.  BEYOND THE NUMBERS 
a)  Our engine 
Our workers are our strength. They are the backbone of the organization and a fundamental resource for our 
success. 
Up to December 31st, 2017 our workers are 3 (2 women and 1 man), plus a person with an internship 
contract. Among these workers, there are 2 women and 1 man. 33% of employees has a permanent labour 
contract, 67% has a fixed-term contract. From the total, 67% of workers has a part-time contract, while 33% 
a full-time contract. 
In 2017, 2 new people were hired (one of those with a full-time contract), both with a fixed-time contract. 
Nevertheless, a worker left the organization in August 2017.
