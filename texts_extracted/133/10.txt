To fa(cid:272)ilitate e(cid:373)plo(cid:455)ees(cid:859) (cid:449)o(cid:396)k-life balance, we have introduced Smart-working practices. Thanks to IT 
technology, they enable employees to work outside the office wall, without any time or space restriction. 
Each employee, whose activity can be performed remotely, can benefit from Smart-working practices, with 
no negative effects on the p(cid:396)odu(cid:272)ti(cid:448)it(cid:455), o(cid:374) e(cid:454)pe(cid:272)ted (cid:396)esults o(cid:396) o(cid:374) (cid:272)olleagues(cid:859) (cid:449)o(cid:396)k. During 2017, 3 resources 
benefited from this practice. 
The average Gross Annual Salary for category and gender has been calculated for employees of both genders 
and refined from the misrepresented effect of part-time contracts. No differences in the amount of women(cid:859)s 
and men(cid:859)s salaries that have the same professional experience and contract (part-time vs full-time) have 
been reported.
