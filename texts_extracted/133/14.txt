As consulting firm, VIVIDA operates inside and outside its offices (located in Piacenza), given its constant 
supports to clients located in nearby cities. For this reason, most of 
our environmental impact is caused by commuting, business trips 
and the use of energy inside the office. 
In 2017 we totally travelled 104.925 kilometres. 
From the reported results it emerges a significant use of cars, 
mostly due to the distance of (cid:272)lie(cid:374)ts(cid:859) offi(cid:272)es, who are mainly 
settled around Milan and Novara. 
Besides some trips in Europe, in 2017 we also went oversea, whose 
distance significantly affected the kilometres travelled by plane. 
What have we learnt from this first collection of data? 
-  We can improve, when possible, by replacing cars with trains 
or buses; 
-  We can also improve home/office mobility by reducing the 
use of cars preferring public transport and other alternative 
solutions like cycling or walking. 
In 2018 we aim to increase by 10% the use of more sustainable 
options for transportation, compared to the number of travels by 
cars and planes.   
 
How much CO  do we have produced in 2017? Hereafter the results (expressed in percentage) divided by 
2
medium of transport used.    
CO2 EMISSIONS 
Plane Train Bus Car
45,51% 46,86%
7,23% 0,41%
 
 
In 2017 the total amount of CO caused by transportation was 9,5 tons. In detail, this amount can be split in:  
2 
-  Commuting had an impact of 7%; 
-  Client visits (including business trips) had an impact of 93%.
