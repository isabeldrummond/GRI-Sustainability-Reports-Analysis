Our objective is to understand the opinion of most of our stakeholders to intercept the aspects that they 
consider to be relevant and consequently plan adequate actions and implement them during the time. For

means a daily high level of mobility. For these 
reasons, the selection of the most appropriate 
mean of transport becomes a relevant issue in 
a perspective of CO emission reduction.
