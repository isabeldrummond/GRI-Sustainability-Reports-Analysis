2.  F‘OM THE LATIN (cid:862)VIVIDU“(cid:863) 
a)  The Team 
The Latin att(cid:396)i(cid:271)ute (cid:862)VIVIDUS(cid:863) refers to a vigorous, determined and firm behaviour. These adjectives are the 
driving engine of the Team. 
VIVIDA & Partners was set up in 2014 and is the result of the initiative of professional experiences from 
different contexts, especially Big Four. 
Carlo, Andrea, Mara, Chiara & Chiara are the soul of the Team. 
 
b)  Partners and associations 
Not only the people who have invested in the share capital of the company, but our partners are also our 
clients, the professionals with which we share complex projects, our suppliers and our bank. 
We have built strong and lasting relations with all of them since we believe that we can create value for the 
whole society only through the mutual exchange of knowledge. 
VIVIDA(cid:859)s professionals participate in the following organizations:  
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Gold Community: VIVIDA, through its       
membership in the GOLD Co(cid:373)(cid:373)u(cid:374)it(cid:455), a(cid:272)ti(cid:448)el(cid:455) suppo(cid:396)ts G‘I(cid:859)s (cid:373)issio(cid:374) i(cid:374) 
developing guidelines for sustainability reports based on transparency, with the 
aim of widening their adoption from worldwide organizations.

c)  Governance 
VIVIDA(cid:859)s go(cid:448)e(cid:396)(cid:374)a(cid:374)(cid:272)e is e(cid:454)t(cid:396)e(cid:373)el(cid:455) si(cid:373)ple. Now there are only two shareholders (but our goal is to increase 
them): Carlo Vasile, the founder, has most of the shares and is the sole director. 
VIVIDA does not have a Statutory Board of Auditors, nor has it a legal auditor since it does not satisfy, at this 
time, quantitative thresholds set by the Italian Regulator. 
The corporate governance is managed by the sole director, who collaborates with external providers to 
comply with accounting, tax, labour and corporate duties.
