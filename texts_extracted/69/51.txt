(1) The direct emissions related to 2017 include emission data from the production of dry ice, which is not available for previous years. The emissions from 
company cars are not currently available. The emissions related to the transport of products using Group’s vehicles are reported in more detail in the indirect 
emissions from product deliveries.
(2) Direct emissions related to 2016 have been recalculated following a more accurate data collection process.
(3) With regards to home care, the kilometers travelled have been estimated considering the number of patients.
