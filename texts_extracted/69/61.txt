INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS 
AND ENGAGEMENT
The SOL Group’s desire to engage and inform all of its 
people is manifest in its adoption of various internal 
communication tools: company house organ SOL 
News, the intranet, the Sustainability Report. SOL 
News was redesigned in 2017 to become a newslet-
ter that could reach out to the entire company 
population. Thanks to the circulation of this publica-
tion, all employees can keep up to date on the Group’s 
main initiatives throughout the year.
During last two years some of the Group companies 
(Vivisol in Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany) 
carried out engagement surveys with the aim of 
assessing the strengths of the organisational engage-
ment and where it can be improved. The results of 
the survey were analysed and communicated to the 
employees involved, and specific internal meetings 
were held to assess the data and define any necessary 
improvement actions.
