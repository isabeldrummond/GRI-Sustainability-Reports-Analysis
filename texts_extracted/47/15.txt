Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018
 
Digital 
GRI 102-2 
The Digital division oversees the management and digital development of the trademarks of the 
GRI 102-6 
  Group across all digital platforms (desktop, mobile, tablet, smart TV and latest generation devices), 
as well as the diversification of the activities of the Group into new digital operations outside the 
current perimeter. The distribution strategy is differentiated by platform and considers both free 
and premium models: the specificity of readers’ information needs on the various platforms and 
the long-term optimisation of value are drivers for the choice of model.  
 
With an average of 
5.04 million unique 
visitors per day and 
25.5 unique visitors per 
month (Audiweb), the 
Group was the sixth 
largest operator in the 
period between April 
and November 2018. 
 
 
 
 
The Digital division is therefore responsible for the development and online management of all of 
the Group’s main brands, particularly Repubblica.it, Repubblica +, the new premium product Rep:, 
the  online  edition  of  the  15  News  Network  titles,  the  standard  and  pure  digital  premium 
membership options (Top News and Noi), a broad collection of entertainment websites ranging 
from the Group’s web radio stations to vertical film and television websites like Mymovies and 
Tvzap, as well as important international partnerships such as Huffington Post Italia and Business 
Insider Italia.   
According to research by Audiweb, which introduced a new measurement and survey system in 
April 2018 in order to provide a better representation of mobile traffic and traffic that previously 
was not correctly attributed to publishers (so-called in-app browsing), in the period between April 
to November 2018 the GEDI Group was named the sixth largest operator in the Italian digital market 
(including international service and platform providers such as Google, Facebook and Amazon), 
with an average of 5.04 million unique visitors per day and 25.5 million unique visitors per month 
across all of its digital property.
