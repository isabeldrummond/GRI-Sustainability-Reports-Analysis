Lucca,  31  October  -  4  November 
 
2018 
  The  Lucca  Comics  event  also 
featured  a  Repubblica-Robinson 
 
stand. One of the most impactful events 
  was the meeting with the cartoonist Gipi 
and the presentation of his works published 
  with the GEDI Group. 
 
 
DeejayTen, one of the main initiatives promoted 
 
by the radio broadcaster Radio Deejay, is a race 
  organised in various Italian cities. Launched in 2005 
as an initiative “amongst friends”, over the years it has 
 
grown exponentially to become an increasingly popular 
and hotly-anticipated event by listeners and runners. The 
 
race represents the climax of a three-day event held in 
Deejay  Village,  brought  to  life  by  radio  hosts  and 
 
characterised by music and entertainment. The initiative 
  has set a trend of beating its attendance records each year. 
With 2018 marking its fourteenth year, the Milan edition of Deejay Ten has become an annual 
 
tradition for both the city and the entire north of Italy and involved 40,000 runners, representing 
  an increase of five thousand people compared to the previous year. Once again, Florence 
confirmed its place as one of the key host venues of the event with almost 12,500 participants in 
  2018.  Bari greeted the fourth edition of the Radio Deejay race with great enthusiasm, with 12,000 
runners taking part. Hosting the event for the second year in 2018, Rome confirmed the success 
  of its début last year. Thirteen thousand runners took part in the race in the magnificent setting 
of Circo Massimo and passed the Colosseum and the Imperial Forum, two of the most evocative 
 
and historical sites in Rome away from the noise of the traffic. 
 
 
 
In  2018  the  second  edition  of  the  new  Deejay 
  Triathlon  was  held,  with  approximately  2,700 
athletes taking part.
