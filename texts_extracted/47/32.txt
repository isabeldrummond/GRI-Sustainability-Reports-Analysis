- live broadcasts and studio productions: in 2018, following the merger with ITEDI, news and 
feature coverage was enhanced through the integration of regional news broadcasts of all of the 
local papers and the digital technologies and video production offered by the Visual Desk. In this 
regard, the live broadcasts following the collapse of Ponte Marondi in Genoa are of particular note, 
ranking among the top ten most followed and commented-on broadcasts of the year. In 2018 
significant presence was given to the various political elections both in Italy and abroad, such as the 
March elections in Italy or the US Midterms in November, with new interview models and live 
broadcasting formats, extending the innovative format across the Group's various newspapers and 
La Stampa in particular. Furthermore, several studio productions were broadcast, such as the 
interview with Steven Spielberg with Repubblica director Mario Calabresi, the special exposé about 
the Mafia with Attilio Bolzoni and the special programme about cancer prevention with Emma 
Marrone., as well as columns, new formats, initiatives, “live” streams and mini documentaries,
