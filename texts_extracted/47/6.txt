GRI 102-14  GEDI  Gruppo  Editoriale  is  committed  to  offering  information,  culture,  commentary  and 
entertainment through its media in accordance with the principles of independence and freedom, 
with the awareness of the role that this activity plays in the formation of the citizen-reader’s ethical 
and moral values.  
The Group’s mission is also to create value for all stakeholders by devoting the required attention 
to financial stability within an adverse market environment, while offering quality products based 
on highly socially and environmentally sustainable management decisions. In order to disclose our 
activities on the subject of sustainability, for the fifth year we are publishing a report prepared in 
accordance with the GRI international guidelines. This year the Group has adopted the updated 
version of the guidelines, the “Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards”, in 
line with the “Core” approach. 
In this document, we adopt a format recognised at European level through which we address the 
various issues based on these themes: the Group’s commitment to informing the citizen-reader and 
its responsibility to the general public; social role and participation in the community; focus on 
human resources; and environmental impacts. 
The Group will always retain a keen focus on these aspects of corporate life, aware of their 
importance in the creation of value both in economic and systemic terms.
