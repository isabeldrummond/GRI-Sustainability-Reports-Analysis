As regards fuel oil, in 2018 district heating consumption amounted to just over 157 tonnes (+28.7% 
compared to the previous year). As neither the offices nor the characteristics of the thermal 
systems have changed, this increase is due to a greater use of heating systems in response to the 
weather conditions in the previous year. Indeed, a comparison of the 2018 and 2016 figures show 
a difference of around 2000 litres only. 
Data relative to the use of fuel by company vehicles is reported in 2018 for the first time. As well as 
company  vehicles  allocated  to  managers,  there  are  certain  employees,  such  as  Distribution 
Inspectors (GEDI Distribution), Antenna Inspectors and Radio Technicians (Elemedia), who, in the 
performance of their duties, travel around the country using company vehicles. The data for 2018 
recorded fuel consumption of approximately 45,000 litres per year. 
Overall, fuel oil consumption (by heating systems and company vehicles) was 201,779 litres in 2018, 
while in 2017 consumption came in at 122,000 litres, not accounting for fuel consumption by 
company vehicles. Taking vehicle consumption out of the equation, the comparison of the two 
years shows an increase of 28.7% relating to the increased use of fuel oil for heating purposes.
