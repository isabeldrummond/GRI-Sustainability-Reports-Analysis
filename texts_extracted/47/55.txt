Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018
 
employees certified to carry out electrical works or to operate specific machinery (e.g. forklift) were 
launched. In the course of the year, training on emergency procedures and the annual training 
refresher for workers’ health and safety representatives were continued. In 2018, a total of 2,632 
hours of classroom-based training was delivered to 338 people. 
A total of 13 accidents were recorded in 2018; of these, one was classified as having “serious 
consequences” (leading to an absence of more than six months) and related to an accidental fall 
when entering the office. 
In line with the reference standards (GRI 403-9), in 2018 the number of commuting injuries 
involving personal vehicles or public transport was not considered, as such journeys were not 
organised by GEDI and did not involve the use of company vehicles. A comparison with the same 
data from 2017, where commuting injuries in personal vehicles were taken into account, reveals a 
similar number of incidents. 
No injuries were recorded in 2018 among workers of third-party companies operating at Group 
offices; to this end, specific monitoring activities were carried out with the companies in charge of 
surveillance, cleaning and maintenance at offices, editorial offices and printing facilities. 
In 2018, no cases of occupational ill health were recorded. 
Finally, with regard to hours worked, the figure for 2018 was approximately 3.5 million, down 4.5% 
on the previous year as a result of the effects of solidarity contracts.
