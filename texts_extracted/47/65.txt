Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018
 
Environmental impact of distribution and logistics 
The Group focuses increasing attention on reducing the environmental impact of the transportation 
of its products and is constantly committed to developing solutions to optimise it.  
Newspapers 
As at 31 December 2018 and following the activities regarding the Group's industrial structure, the 
printing of the newspapers published by GEDI Spa and GEDI News Network Spa is carried out at 
nine printing facilities located throughout Italy, six of which are owned by the Group (Turin, Milan, 
Mantua, Padua, Rome and Sassari) and three of which belong to third-party printers. 
Each night, vehicles depart from the various printing facilities to deliver printed copies to various 
local distributors, who then deliver the copies to Italian newsagents. The transport from the printing 
facility to the Local Distributor (third-party operator) is classified as “primary transport”, while 
transport from the Local Distributor to the newsagent is “secondary transport” and is managed 
wholly and independently by the Local Distributors, who contract third-party suppliers.  
In order to fully saturate the vehicles and thus reduce the environmental impact, action has been 
taken to reduce the number of dedicated and exclusive couriers, outsourcing the activity to 
operators who also transport publications produced by other publishers. Furthermore, transport 
pooling has been introduced at the printing facilities where the local newspapers are printed.  
Periodicals 
Primary transport of periodicals and products sold optionally with titles published by GEDI (books, 
CDs, DVDs etc.) from printing facilities is managed by Gedi Distribution Spa, which has outsourced 
to a single nationally certified operator. This has enabled the maximum possible saturation of the 
vehicles used and a consequent reduction in atmospheric emissions.
