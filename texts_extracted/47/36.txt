 Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 2018 
 
Other income consists of operating income deriving from grants, capital gains on the disposal of 
assets, extraordinary gains and income from equity investments accounted for with the equity 
method. 
The three elements described above comprise the Economic Value Generated, which in 2018 was 
€ 664.4 million (up +4.7% compared to 2017, in which year the results of the ITEDI Group were 
consolidated only from 01 July 2017).  
The distribution of Economic Value is broken down as follows: 
•  Operating costs totalled € 381.5 million (+5.2% compared to 2017), of which costs for 
services constitute the majority (editorial costs, publishing fees and printing and other work 
carried out by third parties, etc.). 
•  The distribution of Economic Value to staff equalled € 249.9 million, up 18.2% compared to 
2017, represented for the most part by wages and salaries to GEDI workers.   
•  The distribution of Economic Value to lenders in 2018 was € 22.3 million (+143.8% 
compared to 2017).  
•  The distribution of Economic Value to shareholders totalled € 0.1 thousand, constituting 
minority interests (profit due to third party shareholders of GEDI News Network S.p.A. and 
Mo-Net S.r.l.). This figure refers to the allocation of third party shares in 2017 as, at the 
time of publication of this document, the Shareholders’ Resolution for 2018 was not 
available. 
•  The remuneration of the Public Administration, in the form of taxes, came to € -1.1 million.  
•  As regards the local community, GEDI made donations and participated in sponsorships 
with a total of € 47 thousand given to charitable organisations.
