 
Our sense of responsibility towards the environment, combined with the desire to offer customers a 
low-priced product with the same level of quality and reliability of new products, has led the Group to 
work to give new life to higher value used original components. 
Accordingly, starting with a used original component, through a process of disassembly, cleaning, 
reconditioning,  reassembly  and  final  testing,  the  Group  is  capable  of  giving  new  life  to  used 
components, thus offering customers many advantages. In fact, in terms of savings, prices are 50% 
lower than those for new components and waiting times are much shorter than repair times, given 
that  reconditioned  parts  are  usually  already  available.  As  is  the  case  with  other  components, 
reconditioned parts are also 100% guaranteed and meet the same quality and reliability standards 
applicable to new products. Lastly, the reuse of used components is also a gesture of respect for and 
awareness of the environment in which we live since it translates into energy consumption and 
material savings.
