 
amounts to € 226,315 thousand and accounts for approximately 34% of the total economic value 
distributed. This portion includes costs incurred for wages and salaries, awards and bonuses, social 
contributions, charges to pension plan provisions and other employee related costs. A portion of 
economic value was distributed to the public administration in the year amounting to € 11,980. An 
amount was distributed to lenders of € 2,987 thousand resulting from finance costs.  
Referring to the remuneration of the risk capital, in view of the continuous evolution of the most recent 
events and the strong acceleration of the negative repercussions affecting all international markets, 
Biesse’s Board of Directors prudently decided not to proceed with the payment of the ordinary 
dividend. An amount of € 600 thousand was distributed to the community under the form of donations, 
sponsorships contributions17 and membership fees. This figure constitutes a further direct and 
indirect impact on the development of the locality for the benefit of local communities. To conclude, 
the amount of € 54,157 thousand constitutes the economic value retained by the Group, consisting 
mainly of profit for the year allocated to reserves, depreciation and amortisation, charges to provisions 
and impairment.
