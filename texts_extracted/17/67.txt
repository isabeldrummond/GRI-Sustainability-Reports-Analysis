 
Approach to environmental management 
Biesse Group pursues the objective of contributing positively to the protection and safeguard of the 
environment  through  the  development  of  strategies  and  initiatives  aimed  at  minimising  the 
environmental impact arising from the activities  carried out thereby.  Accordingly, the Group is 
committed to the constant pursuit of the most appropriate solutions to ensure responsible use of 
resources, a decrease in energy consumption and better management of atmospheric emissions. 
In line with its Environmental Policy, the Group has identified the following lines of strategic action: 
  Natural resource savings 
Biesse Group is committed to produce better, by consuming less energy and less resources and by 
optimising the management of environmental aspects (resources, water, waste and commodities) to 
leave a less impoverished and more liveable environment for future generations. 
The commitment comprises a revision of Biesse products by redesigning and studying them with the 
objective of obtaining a low environmental impact in terms of longer life and greater flexibility, energy 
savings and increased recyclability of components. 
  Reduction of the impact of production systems 
Biesse Group is committed to reviewing and redesigning processes and technologies that prevent 
and/or reduce their environmental impact. This will only be possible by applying the best operating 
techniques and by ensuring rational and efficient use of energy resources and commodities. 
  Compliance with relevant legislation 
Biesse Group's commitment to compliance with environmental legislation constitutes an obligatory 
passage point and reflects the maturity achieved by Biesse's production facilities and management 
system, which guarantees a sustainable use of natural resources and waste management.
