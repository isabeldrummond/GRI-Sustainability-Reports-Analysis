 
Innovation: the pursuit of excellence   
The manufacture of tools and machinery that provide customers with greater efficiency from a 
manufacturing and energy consumption point of view and, at the same time, safely simplify their work 
is the main objective of Biesse Group in the field of innovation.  
The Group has always been focused on the implementation of technological and innovative solutions 
that are not only capable of constantly improving manufacturing performance and the reliability of the 
machinery, but that also relieve operators from physical and mental efforts so as to ensure their 
wellbeing and safety in the workplace and to reduce energy consumption and the environmental 
impact.  
Particular attention has been given to simplicity of use, ergonomics, noise reduction and particles and 
fumes produced. The high degree of integration of mechanics, electronics and software render the 
Group's products “intelligent” and “collaborative”, as well as capable of guaranteeing autonomous 
functionality without the constant presence of an operator. 
Product innovation 
The  integration  of  the  functions  linked  to  technological  innovation  within  the  Group  and  the 
reorganisation of the experimental development function in recent years are instrumental to the 
gradual centralisation of technological research and development work, making it possible to adopt 
an approach that is based less on unforeseen circumstances arising from the manufacturing process, 
in order to be able to make more strategic, wide-ranging decisions. In 2019, over 30018 persons were 
involved in research and development activities, totalling approximately 276,000 working hours.  
The Research and Development function, which is centralised in Biesse S.p.A., can currently count on 
the experience of dedicated professionals, mechanical design engineers and software developers, 
who maintain contact with other professionals within and outwith the Group. 
In order to actively contribute to research in the field of technological development, the Group 
encourages cooperation with other protagonists in the sector through networks and projects that 
unite experts, research centres and universities, both in Italy and abroad. The main collaborations in 
the field of technology in 2019 were with the University of Ancona (study of vibrations, noise, fluid 
dynamics  and  thermodynamics  and  the  development  of  predictive  analysis  algorithms  to  be 
implemented for advanced technologies for use in Industry 4.0), with COSMOB - Furniture consortium 
(conduct of tests on processed products and materials) and with MUSP - Machine Tools and 
Production Systems Consortium (concerning project cluster pertaining to the mechatronics division) 
and with the Smart Factory Cluster, an association whose objective is to create a stable manufacturing 
community, which is active in the development and implementation of a strategy based on research 
and innovation, capable of consolidating and increasing national competitive advantages. 
In 2019, Biesse Group became a member of the Leonardo Committee, which was founded in 1993 by 
Sergio  Pininfarina  and  Gianni  Agnelli,  the  Italian  Trade  Agency,  Confindustria  and  a  group  of 
entrepreneurs, with the objective of promoting and establishing Italian excellence around the world. 
Moreover, the Group is a member of various consortiums and associations that promote and invest 
in industrial research in the field of machinery, production systems and the furniture industry, such as 
ACIMALL (Association of Italian manufacturers of machinery and accessories for wood processing), 
UCIMU (Association of Italian manufacturers of machine tools, robots, automation and ancillary
