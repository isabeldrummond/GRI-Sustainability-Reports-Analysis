 
the number of accident reports in Italy has remained largely unchanged with respect to the same prior 
year period, including cases with a fatal outcome10.  
The SDGs, and especially SDG 13 “Climate Action”, are intertwined with the Paris Agreement, which 
was signed by 195 countries during the course of the conference of that name held in December 2015. 
The objective of the Paris Agreement was to limit increases in average global temperature to a 
maximum of 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to ensure efforts were made to limit the increase to 
a maximum of 1.5°C, in order to significantly reduce the risks and impact arising from climate 
change11.  
Thanks, in part, to the Paris Agreement, in recent years increasing attention has been paid to issues 
concerning climate change. Risks associated with this topic are acknowledged to be increasingly 
significant and their proper management and mitigation are fundamental for business continuity. 
Under these circumstances, financial institutions have shown an interest in providing funds to entities 
that demonstrate they are fully aware of these risks and that they are clearly committed to taking 
advantage of the related opportunities.  
In May 2019, the concentration of CO  in the atmosphere had reached 415 parts per million (ppm), an 
2
increase of 152% on pre-industrial levels12. As pointed out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC), in order to limit the increase in global warming to a maximum of 1.5 °C above pre-
industrial levels, by 2030, it will be necessary to reduce global emissions of CO  to 45% of levels 
2
recorded in 2010 and to then achieve zero net emissions by 205013. The public's attention has been 
drawn to multiple extreme climatic events; furthermore, movements worldwide have more vigorous 
in their demands for renewed attention to the fight against climate change.  
In line with this frame of reference, in 2019, the European Commission launched the European Green 
Deal to make Europe the first continent in the world with a zero climatic impact by 2050, thus giving a 
boost to the economy, improving people's health and quality of life and protecting nature, without 
anyone being excluded from the process. It has been estimated that additional annual investment will 
be needed of approximately € 260 billion to achieve the climate and energy related objectives by 2030.  
Regarding the economy, we are witnessing a phase of near stagnation, with growth in global GDP 
having averaged in the region of 2%14 since 2010. Economic growth and progress can only occur with 
appropriate  expenditure  on  research  and  development:  For  OECD  member  countries,  average 
expenditure on research and development is in the region of 2.5% of GDP15. 
Under these circumstances, the private sector has become a sustainability protagonist at local, 
national  and  international  level  and  is  increasingly  more  aware  of  the  need  to  reconcile  the 
achievement of corporate objectives to those of its stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, 
employees, suppliers and local communities16. Recent developments in legislation related to non-
financial reporting represents a further opportunity to critically examine the economic, social and 
environmental performance of enterprises and their contribution to sustainable development.
