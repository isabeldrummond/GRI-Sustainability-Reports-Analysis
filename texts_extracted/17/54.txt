Evaluation of resources 
On completion of the training process, an individual performance and professional development 
evaluation process then forms part of Biesse Group's personnel development strategy. The Group 
believes it is important to offer its resources tangible career advancement opportunities and that this 
is one of the most important determinant factors affecting employee loyalty and the retention of skills.  
The fundamental principles underlying the evaluation process adopted by the Group recognise as key 
factors the setting of objectives and expectations for each employee in line with the corporate vision, 
the sharing thereof, the evaluation of the results achieved and the preparation of a development plan. 
In this regard, during the course of 2019, a project was launched concerning the evaluation of 
resources that involved approximately 1,500 persons, including executives, middle managers and
