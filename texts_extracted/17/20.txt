Risk management 
Biesse Group has adopted an Enterprise Risk Management Policy in line with the requirements of 
Borsa Italiana's Corporate Governance Code. The aim of the Policy is the development of an integrated 
risk/opportunity management model based on international enterprise risk management standards, 
encompassing a global business risk model and the determination of risk mapping and risk scoring 
methodologies for the identification of priority business risks, the early assessment of potential 
adverse effects and the implementation of the most appropriate mitigating actions.  
This model, which has been formalised under the above mentioned Policy, aims to involve not only 
senior management, but also the heads of the main processes.  
This approach extends to all types of risks/opportunities that are potentially significant for the Group, 
as set out in the risk map that categorises in 4 macro groups the internal or external areas of risk that 
characterise Biesse Group's business model: 
  Strategic risk: risks arising from external or internal factors, such as changes in the market 
environment and business decisions that are wrong and/or implemented inappropriately  
  Compliance and regulatory risk: risks associated with specific legal regulations that the Group 
has to comply with, both due to its business model and to the parent's status as a listed 
company 
  Financial and reporting risk: risks that impact the financial position and the presentation of the 
results of operations 
  Operational risk: risks pertinent to the purely operational part of the business that directly 
impact the Group's value creation capabilities 
By means of enterprise risk management, Biesse Group intends to improve the risk/opportunities 
identification process, to set up a decision making model and reliable strategic planning and to 
improve the quality of business flows and the external stakeholders' perception of the Group.
