 
The Group develops initiatives aimed at a more efficient use of energy resources and a reduction of 
its environmental impact. In this regard, the following initiatives have been implemented:  
  completion of the centralised power factor correction for the production plants located on the 
Pesaro campus and the expansion of the automatic electricity consumption monitoring system;  
  gradual replacement of the lighting systems in various production plants and sales subsidiaries 
with LED lighting systems; replacement of certain cabin transformers and electrical panels with 
new  units  equipped  with  magnetothermic  switches  with  real-time  control  of  energy 
consumption; 
  constant maintenance of existing suction plant; 
  installation of IE4 high-efficiency motors in the inverter suction lines for speed modulation in 
accordance with variations in the quantity of air being sucked in; 
  HSD S.p.A has appointed an electrical designer to analysis consumption and to evaluate new 
projects and layout re-arrangement to support production; 
  Bre.Ma. S.r.l. has installed new loading/unloading doors for goods and machinery with excellent 
sealing quality and fast fold doors have been installed outside each thereof in order to limit the 
loss of heat from inside the plant. 
In a broader framework, the Group continues to implement structured continuous energy carrier 
monitoring systems, such as for electricity, thermal, natural gas and compressed air. 
Further energy consumption consists of the use of petrol, diesel and natural gas, as shown by the 
following table:
