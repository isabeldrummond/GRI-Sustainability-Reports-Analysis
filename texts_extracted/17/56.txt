In relation to Biesse Group's other workers (temporary workers), in 2019, 14 injuries were reported, of 
which 12 were in Italy (8 in the workplace and 4 while commuting) and 2 were abroad (all in the 
workplace). The overall injury rate for other workers was 27.924. The injuries involved men and none 
proved fatal.  
In line with that mentioned above for the Italian companies, the other foreign Group companies have 
also implemented a safety management system in compliance with local regulations.  
Biesse Manufacturing has adopted an occupational health and safety management system and has 
set up a watchdog committee. During the course of 2019, a dedicated position was introduced with 
the role of increasing employee awareness of topics concerning occupational health and safety, 
planning and performance of audits in order to identify and report on any risk situations and 
conditions, provision of assistance to factory management to help them comply with their obligations 
related therewith, the preparation of annual targets and support to management for the achievement 
of established objectives. Moreover, corporate policies were revised and there was an increase in 
raising awareness, including through the posting of specific signs, and in training in order to prepare 
employees to act correctly in emergency situations and to reduce the number of accidents.  
                                                           
23 Rates of injury were calculated using the following formula: (number of injuries / hours worked) x 1,000,000; Injury severity 
rates were calculated using the following formula: (days lost due to injury, including public holidays / workable hours) x 
10,000; Occupational disease rates were calculated using the following formula: (days lost due to occupational disease / 
workable hours) x 1,000,000; in the two years in question, the injury severity rate coincides with the Lost Day Rate (LDR). 
24The health and safety data of external employees includes only the category of the Temporary workers and not other types 
of non-employee workers working at the Group's sites and/or under the control of the Group, in view of their significance and 
the availability of such data on which the Group does not exercise direct control.
