 
Emissions of CO  
2
Biesse Group, which is aware of the adverse impact arising from climate change, constantly tracks its 
direct and indirect emissions: 
  
 
Direct  emissions  (Scope  1)  arising 
 
from  operation  of  plant  and 
  Indirect emissions (Scope 2) arising 
machinery owned by the business, 
  from the generation of electricity 
such  as  heating  systems 
  purchased and consumed by the 
(consumption of natural gas), diesel 
  organisation 
fuel systems, company pool cars and 
 
air conditioning systems. 
 
 
In particular, as regards direct emissions (Scope 1), Biesse Group produced a total of approximately 
6,381 tonnes of CO2e, in line with the previous year.

In relation to indirect emissions (Scope 2), emissions of CO  produced amount to approximately 
2
9,100 tonnes (market based method).

With particular reference to the management of direct emissions, note that the Group has adopted a 
specific policy on pooled purchasing of company car fleets that requires new car purchases to be 
assessed based on their average CO  atmospheric emissions value.

30 Conversion factors used for the computation of 2019 Scope 1 emissions are based on 2019 UK Government GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. 
31Scope 2 emissions are expressed in tonnes of CO , although, according to relevant technical literature, the percentage 
2
included for natural gas and nitrous oxide has a negligible effect on total greenhouse gas emissions (CO equivalent).

32 For the purpose of the computation of 2019 Scope 2 emissions (location based method), use was made of the emission 
factors indicated by Terna's 2017 International comparison (figures at 31 December). 
33 For the purpose of the computation of 2019 Scope 2 emissions (market based method), use was made of the emission 
factors indicated by AIB's European Residual Mixes 2018 for European countries and the emission factors indicated in the 
previous note for the other countries in which Biesse Group operates.
