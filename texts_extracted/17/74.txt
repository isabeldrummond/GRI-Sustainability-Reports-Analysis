 
Management of water resources 
The Group plans to develop strategies to improve the management of water resources, even though 
it does not need huge quantities of water for its production cycles, as a matter of respect for this 
precious resource for the wellbeing of the community. The management of water resources is the 
responsibility of the maintenance, safety and environment function, which, in addition to its other 
activities, provides legislative support for the implementation of new laws and regulations in relation 
thereto. 
The use of water resources is linked to a large extent to normal consumption for sanitary use. As far 
as production is concerned, water is mainly used by the Intermac Glass & Stone division for trials and 
testing of glass and stone processing machinery with water jet cutting systems. During the course of 
2019, a new closed circuit purification system was implemented for water used in the production 
process. 
As a further sign of the Group's commitment to responsible management of water resources, at 
Biesse Manufacturing's plant in Makali, India, sanitary waste water is collected and treated in a 
purification system and then reused for irrigation of the manufacturing plant's green areas.  
In 2019, the amount of water withdrawn decreased by 11% compared to 2018, with an amount 
recorded of 76,130 m3 compared to approximately 85,467 m3 in 2018.

36 A new calculation methodology was adopted in 2018 for amounts relating to water withdrawals by Biesse Group's foreign 
non-manufacturing subsidiaries that have been estimated based on prior year water withdrawal figures for the most 
representative subsidiaries and on employee numbers. By adopting this methodology, approximately 8% of total water 
withdrawals is based on estimates.
