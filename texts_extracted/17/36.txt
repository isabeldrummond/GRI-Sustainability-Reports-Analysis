 
Economic performance   
Biesse Group closed 2019 with revenue of € 705,872 million, representing a decrease in the year of 
4.8%. The downturn in revenue has impacted EBITDA, which, before non-recurring costs, comes to € 
76,732 thousand, being a decrease of 17.2%. There was also a deterioration in the year in EBIT before 
non-recurring items of € 28,115 thousand (€ 39,554 thousand in 2019 versus € 67,669 thousand in 
2018), which, as a percentage of revenue, fell from 9.1% to 5.6%. 
The breakdown of revenue by segment shows revenue reported by the Glass & Stone Division to be in 
line with the previous year (up 0.5% on the 2018 figure), whereas there has been a downturn in the 
year of the performance of the other divisions. In detail, the largest decreases were reported by the 
Components and Mechatronics Divisions (-13.7% and -13.2%, respectively), whereas the Wood and 
Tooling Divisions reported more modest decreases (-4.6% and -2.4%, respectively). 
The breakdown of revenue by geographical area, when compared to 2018 figures, shows revenue 
growth in North America, largely attributable to the delivery and installation of orders received in 2018 
for large systems. Western Europe has continued to be the Group's key target market, with revenue of 
€ 333,015 thousand, which, however, was down 5.8% on prior year. Asia - Oceania and Eastern Europe 
have reported a decrease (-21.5% and -17%, respectively). Lastly, revenue reported by Rest of the 
World is broadly in line with prior year (€ 27,138 thousand, down by 2.5%). 
It should be noted that, once again, the Group's results for the year just ended were adversely affected 
by “non-recurring events and impairment” totalling € 9,911 thousand. As approved by the Board of 
Directors on 20 December 2019, the Group will refocus its strategy for China, by concentrating more 
on the needs of medium to large key accounts for automated technological solutions produced in the 
Italian and Indian plants. Accordingly, manufacturing operations in China will be redimensioned (they 
were originally designed for the entry level segment). For this reorganisation, it has been estimated 
that non-recurring costs of € 4,127 thousand will be incurred. Moreover, based on strategic policy, as 
confirmed by the 2020-22 business plan approved on 21 February 2020, the Group will continue its 
focus  on  technological  innovation  in  order  to  maintain  its  leadership  in  the  relevant  sectors. 
Consequently, certain R&D projects associated with technological products and solutions being 
phased out have been written down by an amount of € 4,070 thousand. Lastly, non-recurring labour 
costs of € 1,634 thousand have been recognised for redundancy incentives and early retirement 
packages.  
Moving on to the financial position, net operating working capital increased in the year by € 20,901 
thousand,  mainly  due  to  a  sharp  decrease  in  trade  payables  of  approximately  €  29.9  million 
attributable to amounts due to suppliers (slowdown in manufacturing operations). Balances arising 
from customer relationships (trade receivables and contractual assets/liabilities) are broadly in line 
with prior year (net decrease of € 2.6 million), whereas inventories have decreased by € 7.3 million. 
The Group reports net financial indebtedness at 31 December 2019 of approximately Euro 18.6 million, 
being a deterioration compared to the December 2018 figure (net cash position of € 25.4 million).  
The net cash/debt position has been adversely affected by the initial application of IFRS 16 (due to 
liabilities associated with right-of-use assets) by an amount of approximately € 26.6 million. Again, 
following the initial application of IFRS16, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment at 
31.12.2019 has increased by approximately € 26.4 million. 
As is well known, since January 2020, the national and international scenario has been characterized 
by Coronavirus disease spread and the consequent restrictive measures for its containment, decided 
by the public authorities of the Countries concerned. These circumstances, which are extraordinary in 
nature and extent, have direct and indirect repercussions on economic activity and have created an 
environment of general uncertainty, which the evolution and effects of, are not foreseeable. The
