The ability to attract and retain people with different and complementary skills and the training of 
leaders capable of guiding the growth of companies, aligning the interests of management and 
shareholders and promoting value creation in a sustainable perspective, are fundamental drivers 
for the development of the Group. 
Italmobiliare operates as a responsible and proactive employer, undertaking to guarantee a wor-
king environment based on the values of fairness, loyalty, transparency and mutual respect. Em-
ployees have the opportunity to best express their potential in a collaborative climate conducive 
to professional and human development, in full equality of opportunity and treatment and having 
respect for all forms of diversity. Fundamental in this sense are the definition of transparent and 
merit-based remuneration policies and training activities aimed at developing new skills, in order to 
keep pace with the markets as they evolve.
At December 31, 2019, the total workforce of the Italmobiliare Group consists of 1,719 people. As 
confirmation of the trust that the Group has in its employees, 92.6% are hired on permanent con-
tracts; and by far the majority of them (96.1%) work full-time rather than part-time. Almost 2 out of 
3 people (64.3%) are employed in production, while 31.4% are white-collar workers and 4.3% hold 
managerial positions. 62.2% of the Group's 74 managers were born in the same country (in the 
case of foreign companies) or in the same region as the operational headquarters in which they 
work (in the case of Italy), confirming their willingness to develop and enhance preferential skills 
and energies from local communities.
The types of contracts applied to employees differ according to the companies that employ them. 
In particular, the Cement and Industry Managers contracts (CCNL) are applied at Italmobiliare and 
Italgen, the Commerce and Services contract at Clessidra, the Rubber and Plastics Industry con-
tract and the Industry Managers contract at Sirap Group companies based in Italy and the Food 
Industry contract at Caff√® Borbone. Collective bargaining agreements cover 80.7% of the Group's 
employees. In addition to employees, the Group also uses the services of 176 collaborators, mostly 
temporary workers or project workers, interns and agents.
During 2019, Group companies had 239 new hires versus 263 resignations, which gave an inco-
ming turnover of 13.9% and an outgoing turnover of 15.3%.
