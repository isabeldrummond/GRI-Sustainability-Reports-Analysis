3.1.4 WASTE MANAGEMENT
The company generates a negligible quantity of hazardous waste. 
The waste produced is kept in temporary storage in a special area, separated by type in dedicated 
containers and/or bins; each container contains a single type of waste and is marked with a label 
bearing the CER code of the waste stored there. The waste is collected periodically by companies 
authorised to collect and transport it and is then sent to suitable plants authorised to treat that type 
of waste. An external consultant who reports directly to the Technical Office manages relations 
with the transporters and with the plants, ensuring that all waste can be properly traced.
