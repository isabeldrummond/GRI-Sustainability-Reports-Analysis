gathered supporting documentation in order to verify its consistency with the available evidence;

and production plant for Caffè Borbone S.r.l., Verolanuova (MN) site and Castelbelforte (MN) 
production plant for Sirap Gema S.p.A., Noves and Remoulins sites and production plants for Sirap 
France SAS, which we selected based on their activities, their contribution to the performance 
indicators at the consolidated level and their location, we carried out visits on site, during which we 
have met their management and have gathered supporting documentation with reference to the 
correct application of procedures and calculation methods used for the indicators. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of 
the Italmobiliare Group as of December 31, 2019 is not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with 
articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI Standards. 
 
Other matters 
 
The NFS for the year ended December 31, 2018, whose data are presented for comparative purposes, have 
been subject to a limited assurance engagement by another auditor that, on March 25, 2019 expressed an 
unmodified conclusion.
