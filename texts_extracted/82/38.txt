3.3.5 WASTE MANAGEMENT
In its business, Italgen produces special waste, both hazardous and non-hazardous, deriving from 
plants, as well as urban-type waste produced in the offices.
In the EMAS Environmental Declaration, the production of waste was assessed as a significant en-
vironmental aspect, with the exception of the production of "sgrigliato" (detritus caught by a grid).
SPECIAL NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE
The main type of waste managed by Italgen is produced at the intake works where there are grids 
at the entrance to the plant which retain the so-called "sgrigliato" and which not only ensure pro-
per operation of the plants, but also help clean the water. River water does, in fact, carry a huge 
amount of suspended material (wood, plants, leaves, plastic and other waste), the quantity of 
which depends on the flow of the river: the rise in the water level during floods, which affect the 
natural expansion areas where there are accumulations of deadwood, allows the current to drag 
everything downstream. The sgrigliato is collected in special bins prior to disposal according to 
specific procedures.
Other types of special non-hazardous waste are produced by the plants and intake works during 
normal operations and maintenance. All of the waste produced is stored in dedicated areas of the 
plants and then transferred to authorised collection centres. Over the last few years, the identifica-
tion of certain categories of waste has changed, identifying the most appropriate EWC (European 
Waste Catalogue) codes so that the waste can be recovered.
