4.2.2 TRAINING
Every year the Human Resources Department plans training initiatives aimed at developing skills 
and promoting continuous training and updating in support of the development and employability 
of the staff.  
Training activities are planned starting from a needs analysis, commensurate with the role and 
skills required. This analysis is followed by detailed planning; during the year and after the training 
has been provided, the activities carried out are monitored and assessed.
In particular, Italmobiliare has identified the need to develop training programmes for the following 
areas:
‧ 
Ethical values, corporate culture and corporate strategies (Legislative Decree 231/2001, the 
Organisation, Management and Control Model, the Code of Ethics, sustainability, etc.)
‧ 
Management training;
‧ 
Technical and operational skills;
‧ 
Safety and environment;
‧ 
Information Systems (Office, digitisation, etc.);
‧ 
Regulation/Regulatory aspects (changes in rules, laws, regulations and directives, e.g. GDPR - 
New Privacy Regulation, Market Abuse Regulation, etc.).
Different methods and times assess the effectiveness of the training according to the type of ini-
tiative:
‧ 
Learning verification questionnaire;
‧ 
Interview with the trainer;
‧ 
Certificate issued by the body that provided the training or by a certification body;
‧ 
Measurement of the degree of satisfaction of the employees taking part in the courses;
‧ 
Assessment by heads of department of the impact of training on the development of their 
staff's skills and on the application of such skills in performing their duties (on-the-job training).
Together with specific training initiatives, through internal mobility, the Company gives people a 
chance to broaden their knowledge and skills, at the same time enhancing the sense of belonging 
to the Company and developing more and more professional capabilities.
