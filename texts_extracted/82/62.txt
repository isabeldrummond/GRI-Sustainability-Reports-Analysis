mittees and roles involved in managing the Model;
‧ 
Operating model, designed to regulate and implement the documentation, procedures and sel-
f-regulation rules laid down in the Model;
‧ 
Architectural model, which defines the set of personal data chosen for the Model and regulates 
the technologies and tools adopted for their processing;

quacy and effective application of the Model.
6.2 Caffè Borbone
6.2.1 CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY AND 
TRANSPARENCY IN PRODUCT INFORMATION
For Caffè Borbone, product quality is an essential element, pursued by adopting international best 
practices regarding industrial processes and the highest standards of quality, safety and process 
and product innovation. With a view to continuous improvement of the company's organisation, 
Caffè Borbone has adopted an internal Quality Management System that is compliant with Inter-
national Food Standards (IFS) and certified ISO 9001:2015. 
The company plans its production by appropriately defining the microbiological, chemical-physical, 
nutritional and allergenic characteristics. This information is shared with customers, who analyse 
and approve the technical specifications of the finished product containing the related requiremen-
ts, reviewed by the entire Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) team based on the 
outcome of the analyses, customer requests, regulatory changes and/or updates, changes in raw 
materials, recipes, packaging and processes that have a direct impact on the finished product. 
Quality control takes place from the raw material procurement stage: the process of buying ba-
tches of coffee from qualified brokers/intermediaries for shipment involves controlling samples of 
pre-shipment tests and pre-customs clearance checks of a commodity and organoleptic type, ai-
med at verifying the quality of the raw coffee received. The quality control function also periodically 
archives the daily production batches also in order to test them over time. 
In order to ensure correct communication of the product's characteristics to the consumer, the 
information given on the packaging is subject to periodic review to ensure compliance with any 
regulatory updates.
