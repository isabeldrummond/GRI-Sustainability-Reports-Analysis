1.4 Sustainability Management
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
The Italmobiliare Group recognises the importance of a transparent dialogue with its stakeholders 
and with all those who participate in the life of the companies, with particular attention to social 
and environmental issues, so as to create economic value and growth of the investment portfolio 
in the medium to long term. Italmobiliare adopts multiple channels of discussion with its sharehol-
ders, the financial community, portfolio companies, employees and public authorities. Companies 
of the Group adopt the most effective methods of dialogue with respect to the nature and specific 
requests of their respective stakeholders, promoting the active involvement of their collaborators. 
In line with what was said in the previous Sustainability Report, in 2019 the Group embarked on an 
extension of its stakeholder engagement activities and initiatives, which led to an updating of the 
materiality matrix.
MATERIALITY ANALYSIS  
Two years after the start of the sustainability reporting process and in the face of changes in the 
scope of the business and of reporting, the materiality matrix had to be updated to verify the cur-
rent level of materiality of economic, social and environmental issues with respect to the strategies 
and main areas of impact. 
The update started with a review of the stakeholder map, which was carried out thanks to the 
involvement of the management of Italmobiliare and the subsidiaries included in the scope of 
reporting, from which 6 categories of priority stakeholders emerged based on the level of interest 
and influence versus the Group.
