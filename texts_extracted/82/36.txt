in reservoirs or derived directly from the river, is sent to the hydroelectric power plant employing 
tunnels, penstocks and canals. The principal "machine" of the plant is the turbine which, driven by 
the power of water, converts hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. This, in turn, is converted 
into electricity by an electric generator and returned via a transformer to the high voltage lines that 
transport and distribute the energy throughout the territory.

The consumption of electricity, fuel and auxiliary materials for maintenance purposes does not 
constitute a significant environmental issue for the organisation. In order to further limit the related 
impacts and increase production efficiency, in 2012, Italgen began a process of reducing self-con-
sumption, which continued in 2019 with the installation of new lighting systems with LED lamps at 
the hydroelectric plants and related works (intakes, tunnels, dams, etc.).
A tangible and concrete sign of the company's commitment to environmental sustainability are the 
clean energy distributors, which make it possible to monitor, directly on the website, the levels of 
distribution of energy from renewable sources of the hydroelectric power plants owned, the num-
