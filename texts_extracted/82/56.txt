Sustainability Report | HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK F57
5.3 Sirap
Sirap stands out for its particular attention to issues of health and safety in the workplace and for 
its target of "zero accidents". The "We Work In Safety" project has been going for nearly ten years 
and it has led to a progressive change in behaviour throughout the organisation. Sirap has develo-
ped a series of communication and operational tools to eliminate accidents. 
The main ones include:
‧ 
the Safety Policy, an integral part of the "Sustainability - Quality, Health, Safety and Environment" 
policy; 
‧ 
"Counting days without accidents"; 
‧ 
the "Blue Cards", paper forms for reporting dangerous conditions and near-accidents; 
‧ 
safe working procedures (SWP) for the most risky activities; 
‧ 
the 5ESSE project (separate, sweep, sort, standardise, support) designed to improve safety, 
productivity and quality and reduce waste; 
‧ 
the Behaviour Observation System (BOS) which provides for local checks by the COO's office; 
‧ 
HSE Dialogue Sirap (HSED), an observation system geared to consolidating positive attitudes, 
actions and behaviour and identifying areas of improvement. 
For each location (headquarters, Verolanuova, Castelbelforte, San Vito, Castiglion F.no, Hatvan, 
Murowana, Noves and Remoulins), an Integrated HSE Management System has been progressi-
vely implemented, developed on a voluntary basis for the optimisation and continuous improve-
ment of processes relating to workers' health, safety at work and environmental protection. The 
system certified according to the international standards ex-OHSAS 18001 and UNI EN ISO 14001, 
currently covers over two thirds (67.3%) of the group's personnel. The only exceptions are the em-
ployees of Petruzalek's non-production locations, those of the production sites awaiting HSE cer-
tification and those of logistics sub-contractors (warehouse and transport activities) of the Italian 
group companies.
Group companies use a risk identification and assessment system through an integrated process 
which includes as the main ones: 
‧ 
Elimination of the source of risk
‧ 
Replacement of the source of risk with one of lesser impact
‧ 
Structural technical measures
‧ 
Organisational measures
‧ 
Training
‧ 
Health surveillance, carried out by external structures as required by local legislation. 
The main hazards identified for the production plants are: 
‧ 
Being invested by a forklift truck;
‧ 
Being crushed and dragged by moving parts
‧ 
Machinery or products catching fire;
‧ 
Manual handling of loads.
