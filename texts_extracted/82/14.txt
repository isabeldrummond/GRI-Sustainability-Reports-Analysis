Sustainability Report | THE ITALMOBILIARE GROUP F15
Subsequently, it was identified a list of potentially relevant topics for the Group on the basis of an 
analysis of the activities of Italmobiliare S.p.A. and its subsidiaries, in terms of opportunities and 
the socio-economic and environmental impacts, supplemented by a comparison with comparable 
organisations.
These were proposed to the management of Italmobiliare, the subsidiaries and external stakehol-
ders (employees of Italmobiliare, shareholders, financial analysts) by asking them to fill in a que-
stionnaire. In the case of regulatory bodies and the media, the involvement took place indirectly 
through an analysis of public information (i.e. the rules and regulations in force for listed compa-
nies and financial holding companies and press articles concerning listed companies and financial 
holding companies).
Considering the Group structure, in which the Holding Company controls firms operating in diffe-
rent sectors, the materiality analysis was carried out with the aim of presenting the key issues for 
the Group as a whole, those that are most representative of its main areas of business. 
The process ended with the identification of 20 material topics, which are represented in the ma-
teriality matrix.
Compared to the previous materiality matrix approved in 2018, the themes "contribution to local 
employment", "waste management" and "correctness and transparency of product information" 
were integrated, while the themes "sustainable management of the supply chain", "energy manage-
ment", "atmospheric emissions and climate change", "water resource management and discharge 
Materiality matrix of the 
quality", "local communities", "human rights", "diversity, inclusion and non-discrimination" were not

material. The topics "prevention of anti-competitive behaviour", "environmental compliance", "so-
cio-economic compliance" and "training" were made explicit in the matrix, while "ethics and busi-
ness integrity" and " transparency" were unified.
