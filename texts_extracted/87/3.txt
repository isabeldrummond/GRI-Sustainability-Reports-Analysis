sustainability report 2019  Letter from the ceo
The Company is, within all stake-
holder categories, increasingly view-
ing sustainability issues across the 
4 5
board  as  relevant.  The  common 
approach has changed significantly 
over the past few years and recent 
events related to the Covid-19 pan-
demic have further raised awareness 
in this area. Social and environmen-
tal issues are also making their pres-
ence strongly felt in the financial sec-
tor.
Manni Group has included Sustain-
ability  among  the  three  develop-
ment drivers, together with Interna-
tionalisation and Innovation, as we 
are confident that our positioning 
will allow us to make a positive con-
tribution in all areas in which we op-
erate. However, a special role to this 
Letter from 
end will be played by innovative sys-
tems and solutions intended for the 
construction business, which is one 
of the industries causing the stron-
gest environmental impact.
Indeed, buildings account for 40% 
of  air  pollution,  accommodating 
the ceo people whose health must be pro-
tected, cosnidering also public spac-
es. Moreover, albeit with much delay, 
we have embarked on an indisput-
able path that is leading to what we 
like to call “a construction business 
for the buildings of the future”.
