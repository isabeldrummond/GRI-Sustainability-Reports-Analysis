THE CEMENTIR GROUP
How cement 
is made
 
The Cementir Group’s main area of operations is the 
production of cement. The process, which has been 
refined over the centuries, from the mortars of the 
Ancient Egyptians to early 19th century industrial models, 
starts with natural raw materials such as limestone, 
gypsum and clay extracted from natural quarries and 
crushed. This is then dosed, mixed with other elements 
and ground to obtain the “raw meal”.  
The raw meal is cooked at very high temperatures in 
special kilns, which are fuelled mainly by fossil fuels, in 
order  to  obtain  a  semi-finished  product  known  as 
“clinker”, cement’s main component. Once cooled, clinker 
undergoes a process of grinding, mixing with gypsum and 
other mineral constituents (slag, fly ash, limestone, 
pozzolana), to obtain the various types of cement.  
Thanks to its strong industrial capacity and a comprehensive 
presence on international markets, in 2019 Cementir Holding 
distributed worldwide around 6.8 million tons of grey cement 
and over 2.7 million tonnes of white cement of various types 
and classes, produced in 11 plants located in Denmark, 
Belgium, Turkey, Egypt, China, Malaysia and US.
