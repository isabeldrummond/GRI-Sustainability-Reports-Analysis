2 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 
THE 4 PILLARS
The LOTOTO System (Lock Out, Tag Out, Try Out) is one of the most effective tools for ensuring health and safety in 
the cement industry, and is based on a risk assessment model mainly developed on the use of dangerous machineries. 
The system, applied at the Aalborg and İzmir plants, has been improved to become an example of best practice 
in the Group’s cement plants and was added to the health and safety training courses. 
For the 2019 reporting period, the Group has updated the data collection criteria in respect of lost time incidents, 
in order to increase the transparency and perform a more accurate analysis on data gathered from the companies. 
For this reason, the numbers between 2019 and the previous reporting years cannot be fully comparable.  
Below are the updated common definitions applied in the Group for the monitoring of health and safety KPIs 
from 2019 onwards.
