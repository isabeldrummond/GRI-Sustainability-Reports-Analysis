THE 4 PILLARS
“The Group offers the same opportunities to all workers and expressly forbids any form of abuse by those in positions 
of authority or coordination. Abuse means any behaviour that results in requesting, or persuading to offer, services, 
personal favours or other benefits detrimental to the dignity, professionalism or independence of others. All 
recipients of this Code, defined by national and international legislations, are required to refrain from engaging in 
illicit behaviour that is harmful to an individual, such as, but not limited to, offences against the individual, child 
labour, people trafficking and child pornography”. 
In addition, our Group Diversity Policy has been published now and we are working on the Group Human Rights 
Policy in order to raise awareness of these important topics in our personnel and in our suppliers.
