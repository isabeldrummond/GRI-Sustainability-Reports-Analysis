The Executive Director also discusses the effectiveness of the design and operation of the internal risk 
management and control systems with the Audit Committee and render account of this to the Board. 
The Chief Executive Officer is primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company. Only one 
Executive Director has been appointed and he is also automatically Chief Executive Officer and Chairman pursuant 
to the Company’s Board Rules and Articles of Association.  
The Board also appoints a non-executive director as Senior Non-Executive Director to serve as the chair of the 
Board as referred to under Dutch law according to the Company’s Articles of Association and Board Rules. The 
Senior Non-Executive Director cannot be a former Executive Director and must be independent in accordance 
with Best Practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code. The Senior Non-Executive Director cannot be the chair of the Audit 
Committee or the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. 
The Board may designate one (1) or more of its Non-Executive Directors as vice-chairman for a period decided by 
the Board. If the Senior Non-Executive Director is absent or unwilling to take the chair, a vice-chairman is entrusted 
with the duties of the Senior Non-Executive Director entrusted to him by the Board.  
The Board has established two committees from within its ranks to provide advice and submit proposals: the Audit 
Committee and the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. 
The annual Corporate Governance Report is also available for consultation within the Board report on the company

The current composition of the Board of Directors shows a satisfactory degree of diversity and it also meets the 
target set by Dutch law on gender ratio, i.e. at least 30% for each gender. It is also compliant with the diversity 
policy and the profile approved by the Board where diversity is not based exclusively on gender and age, but also 
on technical and professional skills, which must be taken into account when appointing new members of the 
Board of Directors and committees of the Group.
