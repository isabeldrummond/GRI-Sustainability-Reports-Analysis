Energy consumption in the waste management sector has decreased compared to 2017 and has remained in 
line with the 2018 data, trend in line with the one observed also for the energy intensity index (calculated using 
tons of waste collected as the denominator).

CO  EMISSIONS

Cement  production  has  one  of  the  highest  levels  of  energy 
consumption and GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions of all industrial 
processes and is responsible for 5% of global GHG emissions.  
The Cementir Group is striving to find economically sustainable 
solutions to limit GHG emissions from the combustion of raw 
materials (responsible for approximately 40% of CO2 emissions). This 
mainly involves the use of alternative fuels with a high calorific value 
to replace fossil fuels. Early-stage experimental projects are also 
ongoing to reduce CO2 emissions that are defined as process 
emissions  because  they  are  associated  with  limestone 
decarbonisation; this chemical reaction is responsible for about 60% 
of cement production emissions, which are difficult to curtail with 
current technology.  
To curb this latter aspect, studies on cement mixes are ongoing, to 
establish whether clinker, the fundamental component of cement 
production, could be partly replaced with innovative materials with a 
lower environmental impact without altering product quality.  
Opportunities for the Group in this area are affected by possible 
changes to the regulatory framework in Turkey regarding waste
