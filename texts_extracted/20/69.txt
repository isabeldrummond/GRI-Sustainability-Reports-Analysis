 
WATER CONSUMPTION 
The cement and concrete production processes do not have a high impact on water resources. In dry cement 
production processes, water is used principally to cool the systems and for conditioning the kiln gases; in wet 
and semi-wet production processes, on the other hand, the specific consumption of water resources is higher 
as the water is vaporised during the production process. The water discharge is not significant in quantity or 
in pollutant concentration. 
The increase in 2019 data is mainly due to the inclusion of water withdrawal at the US plant of LWCC (the 
American company acquired in 2018). Below are the consumption data:

Over the years, the Cementir Group plants have adopted some technical solutions in order to reuse or use 
water resources more efficiently.

In the production of ready-mixed concrete, water is one of the most relevant resource in the production process 
as it represents an input resource. Water consumption decreased during the last year.

In the Groupâ€™s other activities, water consumption is more or less irrelevant, as it is not linked to production processes15.
14 The data for 2018 were restated due to an erroneous allocation of municipal water supplies or other public or private water utilities from CCB 
(cement & aggregates plants). 
15 The Clypot quarry in the material extraction phase collects a volume of water that is entirely reused (626,843 m3 in 2019). While companies operating 
in the waste management sector have significantly lower water withdrawals compared to the cement and ready-mixed concrete sectors. In 2019, 
the water consumption for waste management sector was about 10.000 m3 (in 2018 the water consumption was about 12.000 m3.
