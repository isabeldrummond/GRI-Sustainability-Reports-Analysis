OTHER AIR EMISSIONS 
The environmental impact of cement production also involves other air emissions, mainly sulphur oxides (SO2) 
and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These are associated with combustion in the firing of raw meal that is obtained from 
processing raw materials and from dust that is generated when grinding the clinker 
Ready-mixed concrete plant Bergen, Norway with gypsum and other ingredients to produce cement. Emissions are monitored 
through  continuous  monitoring  systems  or  through  spot  measurements,  in 
accordance with local regulations and in consideration of the characteristics of the 
plants. The monitored data is periodically communicated to the competent 
authorities, which verify compliance with the limits in the plants. 
In 2019, NOx emissions from the Cementir Group plants amounted to 9,598 tonnes, 
with an emission index per ton of cement (kg/t TCE) of 0.98, while SO2 emissions 
originating from sulphur in the fuels and raw materials used in Group plants 
amounted to 1,431 t, with an emissions index per ton of cement (g/t TCE) of 146. 
The CO emissions amounted to 13,304 t with an emission index per ton of cement 
(kg/tTCE) of 1.35, with a slight increase compared to the previous year (1.24 kg/tTCE).  
Finally, dust emissions reached 348 t with a dust emissions index per ton of cement (g/t TCE) of 35, lower than 
2018 (45 g/TCE). To reduce their impact, some plants updated their technologies for reducing air emissions.
