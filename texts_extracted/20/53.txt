ALTERNATIVE RAW MATERIALS
 
Cement production requires large quantities of natural raw materials,  The Cementir Group  
such as limestone, clay and gypsum, extracted from natural quarries 
is particularly focused  
using various methods. These are initially mixed to produce the meal 
from which the clinker is made, and subsequently added to the clinker  on the environmental 
and milled to obtain different types of cement. The Cementir Group is  aspects associated with 
particularly focused on the environmental aspects associated with its 
its operations with the 
operations with the aim of limiting their impact on ecosystems and on 
aim of limiting their 
the areas concerned. In this sense, it continues its commitment to 
reduce the use of non-renewable raw materials, promoting the use of  impact on ecosystems and 
alternative raw materials, so called because they do not originate from 
on the areas concerned
quarries but from other production processes. The Group has set the 
target for lowering its clinker/cement ratio to 69% for grey cement 
and 80% for white cement. This objective is also attained by 
substituting clinker with alternative raw materials.

In 2019 the cement production plants of the Cementir Group used a total of about 15 million tons of materials 
to produce cement, slightly less compared to the previous year (in the last three reporting years there has been 
a decrease in raw materials used of 6.8%). That decrease is partly linked to the drop in the total production of 
cement recorded in 2019. During the year, almost 12% of raw materials used were recycled, including fly ash, 
blast-furnace slag and other sub-products deriving from the quarrying activities at the CCB plant in Belgium.
