A work Group has also been set up to create a system to standardise safety actions and best practices. The 
following are the main measures implemented to ensure compliance with laws, regulations and directives 
applicable in EU countries and to minimise accidents:  
• analysis and ongoing update of all health and safety risks and hazards related to each task carried out in 
the Group plants and offices;  
• suitable management, update and communication of internal policies and procedures drawn up and 
approved by senior management for the correct performance of work activities in terms of accident 
prevention;  
• investment in and expenditure on safety equipment (both personal and plant) and machinery to maintain 
an advanced standard of technology;  
• internal audits carried out by Cementir HSE functions;  
• specific intensive training on preventing the occupational risks identified and on technical expertise for the 
correct use of machinery. In 2019, over 18, 796 hours of specific health and safety training were provided. 
Personnel engaged in production activities were the main beneficiary of these specific training programmes; 
• information and engagement campaigns to increase the accountability of all employees at all levels;  
• continuous improvement of the occupational health and safety management system by defining 
measurable indicators monitored according to predetermined implementation plans; 
• development of Risk Awareness / Assessment processes at individual employee level in order to minimise 
chances of accident.
