INVESTMENTS IN SUSTAINABILITY AND DIGITIZATION 
To guarantee the development of the Group’s Climate Change Strategy and to achieve the Group’s Sustainability 
Targets, in the 2020 - 2022 Industrial Plan we have planned an investment of EUR 100 million which will include, 
among other things: 
• construction of an 8 MW wind farm to adequately supply the Aalborg plant; 
• waste heat recovery in our Danish and Turkish plants; 
• expansion of district heating to 50,000 families in Aalborg; 
• increase in the use of alternative fuels from the current 40% to 80% in Belgium;  
• digitalisation of industrial processes with the “Cementir 4.0 programme”, to improve industrial processes 
in cement production plants through new digital technologies. Digital transformation focuses on the entire 
value chain, from procurement to production processes, maintenance and logistics. 
 
Cementir 4.0 is a digitalisation programme focused on four different manufacturing areas:

Smart Maintenance 
The digital monitoring of equipment and processes with the collection of unique and specific data in real time 
allows for a rationalisation of maintenance. This ultimately helps productivity by reducing downtime and 
optimises energy costs. 
Future-Ready Production 
Automation, remote control, production “smartification” and advanced production process control allow for systems 
monitoring and continuous complex parameter setting optimisation, thus guaranteeing high output quality. 
Streamlined Supply Chain 
Smart logistics based on real-time information about shipment orders, smart warehousing, integrated digital 
sales and operations planning (S&OP). Improvement of tendering and requests for quotations (RFQ) processes 
and physical inventory streamlining. 
Engaged People And Safe Workplace 
All automation and technology will increase employees’ safety and boost their engagement level.
