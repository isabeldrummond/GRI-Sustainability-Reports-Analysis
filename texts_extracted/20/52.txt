GROUP SYNERGIES  
 
Most of the Cementir Holding's use of alternative fuels takes place at the plants in Aalborg in Denmark, 
Eastern Thrace and İzmir in Turkey, which alone use 87% of the total alternative fuel used by the Group. This 
is because, in some countries (Turkey and United Kingdom), the Group integrates the operations of its cement 
business with those of the management and recycling of waste. The two plants have cutting-edge 
technologies for harnessing alternative fuels and make use of a part of the waste recovered at the Neales 
Waste and Hereko company plants. In Kömürcüoda, near Istanbul, the Cementir Group made a major 
investment to provide Hereko with equipment to generate fuel from municipal solid waste for use at its cement 
plant in Eastern Thrace and other local cement plants, as well as providing a sustainable solution to the 
problem of municipal solid waste in a big city like Istanbul. Bio-mechanical processes and drying generate 
refuse-derived fuel (RDF) and solid recovered fuel (SRF). This investment has enabled a constant increase in 
the use of alternative fuel in the production of thermal energy in the plants in Turkey, while at the same time 
reducing the use of traditional fuels.
