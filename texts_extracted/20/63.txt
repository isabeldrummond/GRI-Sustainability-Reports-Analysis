RISK ANALYSIS AND POLICIES ADOPTED  
In addition to the risks described in the previous chapter, the cement production process is associated with 
environmental impacts in terms of atmospheric emissions, mainly carbon dioxide, dust and nitrogen and 
sulphur oxides. In European countries where the Group operates, there is a risk posed by governmental 
decisions on emissions and fluctuations in the price of CO2 emission quotas (set by the EU Emissions Trading 
System, EU ETS), especially in the medium and long-term period. These annually permitted emission quotas 
are also being discussed in other countries where the Group operates, like China, where the introduction of a 
system comparable to the EU one should have started in 2017 but has been postponed. The Chinese carbon 
emissions trading in the thermal power sector may be implemented by the end of 2020. As for the cement 
industry, carbon emissions trading will be carried out later on, due to the characteristics of cement production. 
However, the authorities are collecting and verifying emissions data. 
To mitigate these risks, the Group constantly monitors its emissions and 
compliance with regulations, planning the availability of CO2 emissions 
quotas. 
Cementir has committed that all operating companies in the cement 
production, concrete production and waste management sectors have to 
operate with a certified environmental management system (i.e. ISO 14001). 
This foresees the commitment of Senior Management to set policies, 
objectives and initiatives for the continuous improvement of performances

concerning the main environmental impacts identified. As well as aiding in 
constant performance monitoring, the systems establish management procedures 
and operating instructions to guide plant operations. 
As of 2019, 14 operating companies (8 cement plants, 2 RMC companies and all 4 companies operating in 
the waste business) have adopted a UNI EN ISO 14001 certified management system, representing 67% of 
all operating companies. The goal is to reach 86% of coverage in 2025 and 100% in 2030.  
Given the characteristics of the production process, the products and the regulatory framework, the Group 
plants’ number-one priority in their environmental policies is to gradually but continuously replace traditional 
fuels to reduce emissions. 
The Group provides staff training and analyses the environmental risks of its operations, involving management to 
ensure compliance with current regulations, best environmental standards and Best Available Techniques (BAT).
