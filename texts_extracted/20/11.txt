GROUP’S STAKEHOLDERS
 
 
Management of the Group’s main stakeholders varies in terms of method and the frequency of listening and 
involvement, based on type of subject, topic, interest and characteristics of the Group’s various regions. 
Considering the Parent Company is a Holding, some of these stakeholders’ interface directly with central 
structures, while others are purely interested in performing the local activities of Group plants and the 
management of relations with those subjects is delegated to the regional level. Therefore, frequencies of 
stakeholder engagement and topics discussed with them vary by stakeholder category and countries where 
the Group operates. 
The table below lists the Group’s main stakeholders and the subjects of interest identified for each one.
