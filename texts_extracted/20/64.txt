2 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 
THE 4 PILLARS
ENERGY CONSUMPTION 
Cement production requires considerable levels of energy consumption in its various processes because of 
the high temperatures that must be reached in the kiln (1500Â°C), the electricity required to grind the product 
and the quantity of material used.  
Thermal energy is used in the start-up and operation of the kilns and the operation of the burners or boilers 
required to increase production efficiency and optimise the production process (for example, to dry raw 
materials and fuels). Electricity, on the other hand, is mainly used to operate the mills that grind the raw 
materials, clinker and fuels.  
The intensity coefficients for the environmental performance indicators are calculated using Total Cement 
Equivalent (TCE), an indicator linked to the plant's production of clinker, based on the production of clinker 
and on the plant's average clinker/cement ratio. This choice was made because the production of clinker, the 
main constituent of cements, is the phase of production where the environmental impacts are greatest. 
In 2019, the cement production plants used 29,062,794 GJ of thermal energy and 4,278,324 GJ of electricity. 
The energy intensity indices have suffered small changes compared to the previous reporting year, with a total 
energy consumption coefficient on equivalent ton of cement produced at 4.01 (GJ/tTCE).
