The Aalborg production plant has a system for recovering  
heat from combustion gases used. The thermal energy recovered from  
the system is used to supply the district heating network of the city  
of Aalborg, meeting the annual heating requirements  
of about 36,000 households which will become 50,000 in the near future, 
covering about half of its urban population.  
 
In 2019, the Aalborg Plant provided 1,6 milion GigaJoule of thermal energy to the local community.
In 2019, 7 cement plants adopted the EN ISO 50001 certification for energy management systems, in line with 
our goal of increasing the level of energy efficiency.  
Cementir has committed that all operating companies in the cement production, concrete production and 
waste management sectors have to operate with a certified energy management system (i.e. ISO 50001). 
As of 2019, the 33% of all operating companies are certified ISO 50001, in 2025 the percentage will be double 
to 71% while in 2030 the goal is that all operating companies will be certified.

The ready-mixed concrete production plants, which have an energy requirement that is far lower than cement 
plants, used about 70,000 GJ of electricity and 284,000 GJ of thermal energy. The energy intensity index for these 
plants was calculated using tons of concrete and aggregates produced during the year as the denominator.
