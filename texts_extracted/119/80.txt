Human Rights  
Through specific procedures, practices and company policies, SIT guarantees the observance and 
correct application of its codes of conduct. The guiding principles behind the Group’s codes consist of 
and derive from the following international standards: 
•  The United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights (which we are committed to in its 
entirety); 
•  The  International  Labour  Organisation’s  Tripartite  Declaration  of  Principles  Concerning 
Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy; 
•  The European Convention on Human Rights, under the jurisprudence of the European Court 
of Human Rights; 
•  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises. 
Reference is also made to applicable national, regional and community legislation on labour law and 
human rights. These represent the underlying values which the company upholds and the basis of 
relations between the employer and its employees. 
SIT rejects and actively opposes all actions that may cause any form of physical, psychological or 
exploitative harm to individuals, such as forced labour, child labour, human trafficking, harassment, 
discrimination or extortion. 
SIT is committed to adopting policies to make every employment relationship at its facilities a positive 
and eco-sustainable experience that guarantees: health and safety, environmental protection and 
sustainability, fair working hours and compensation, the right to work, freedom of association, and 
collective bargaining. 
SIT fully respects and guarantees the right to work and the freedom of association of employees at all 
its facilities. As much as 94.78% of Group employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, 
and, in Italy, monthly meetings are held with organisational trade union representatives to discuss 
production and labour issues.
