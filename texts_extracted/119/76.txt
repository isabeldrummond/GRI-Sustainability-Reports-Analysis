    SIT S.p.A. â€“ Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at  
December 31, 2019 
A water and drinks dispenser was also installed in the canteen in 
Padua. By installing these services, we hope to avoid the consumption 
of around 90-120 disposable plastic bottles a day, amounting to an 
average of about 25,000-30,000 plastic bottles a year. 
The same project also involved replacing plastic cups with automatic 
coffee machines, and Blu dispensers with recycled paper cups.
