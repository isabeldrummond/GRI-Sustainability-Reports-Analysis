Employee communication 
To promote internal communications and the engagement of resources, the Group distributes a 
monthly magazine entitled SIT&Talk to all branches worldwide. The magazine contains articles written 
exclusively by employees themselves aimed at disseminating information at all levels on corporate 
news, business performance, organisational changes, technical subjects, company products and 
general culture, and at engaging employees in the various activities of company facilities and offices.

Plastic Free Project 
 
Being plastic free is not easy, but SIT has accepted the challenge, and in September 2019, it launched 
its first Plastic free project aimed at decreasing and eliminating the use of disposable plastics. 
The pilot was initially rolled out to the Group’s main offices in Padua, where a number of micro-filtered 
water dispensers/towers were installed. Employees were also given stainless steel drinking bottles.
