    SIT S.p.A. – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at  
December 31, 2019 
In relation to such safeguards against corruption, the Group continues to promote and invest in 
initiatives aimed at making the internal control environment ever more effective, efficient and 
pertinent. 
In order to ensure greater distribution of the SIT Group’s anti-corruption policies, such as its Ethics 
Code, in 2019, the Head of the Internal Audit Department carried out dedicated training sessions for 
top management and first-line managers at the Group’s primary international subsidiaries (in Mexico, 
the  Netherlands  and  Australia).  An  additional  training  session  was  carried  out  during  the  HR 
Worldwide Meeting, which involved HR managers at subsidiaries in China, Romania and Mexico.  
On-site training sessions will be rolled out to other plants (in China and Romania) in 2020, and to 
representatives in sales offices in the USA, Argentina, the Czech Republic and Germany. 
Finally, the drafting and issuing of a specific Anti-Corruption Policy is expected in 2020, as required by 
the Group’s improvement commitments. 
No episodes of active or passive corruption were detected within the Group in 2019. 
The value chain  
The Group’s orientation to the pursuit of the highest ethical standards goes beyond corporate 
boundaries to engage all actors making up the SIT value chain. Regarding relations with third parties, 
in 2017, SIT defined the Ethics code for suppliers and Third-party intermediaries, which expresses 
the basic principles third parties, individuals and entities must comply with in supplying the Group 
with goods, services, or intermediary services.  
For more information on SIT’s approach to responsible supply chain management, refer to the 
chapter “Supply chain”.
