Waste management 
The Group makes sure to correctly manage the production, recovery and disposal of waste. As such, 
it has adopted operating procedures and instructions to guarantee the correct processing of said 
waste.  
The main types of hazardous waste produced include used oil, (halogenated and non-halogenated) 
solvents  and/or  solvent  mixtures,  activated  carbon  from  perchloroethylene  washing  machines, 
aqueous washing solutions, degreasing waste, oil-containing metal sludge, and packaging containing 
hazardous substance residues.  
The non-hazardous waste includes sludge from the treatment of industrial water, metal and plastic 
packaging, and ferrous and non-ferrous swarf.

It should be noted that the figure for waste produced and destined for reuse is in line with last year’s 
value, since the figure includes excavated earth and rocks produced while constructing a new building 
in Rovigo, in addition to other activities that are not routinely carried out by the Group. 
The "other" item in the table includes waste that does not fall into any of the other categories included 
the table. This includes mainly liquid waste sent for disposal, rather than to be reused. In particular, it 
refers  to  liquid  waste  conferred  to  chemical-physical  and  biological  treatments,  and  which  is 
consequently not “incinerated” or disposed of in “landfill.” Data for 2018 reflects a peak in production 
that started at the end of 2017 and continued throughout 2018 and into 2019. Said production peak 
led to a significant and necessary increase in the production of these liquid wastes. As is evident from 
the data, and in reference to the above, the Group has considerably reduced the amount of waste 
included  in  the  "other”  field,  reducing  its  production  to  less  than  a  third.  What’s  more,  this 
improvement is even more notable when taking into consideration only the hazardous waste included 
in the "other" field. This ten-fold decrease is owed to the upgrading of concentration units following

been identified from information provided in disposal contracts.
