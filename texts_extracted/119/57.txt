    SIT S.p.A. – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at  
December 31, 2019 
the purchase and installation of a new high-performance emulsions concentrator, which has allowed 
for a significant reduction in hazardous liquid waste. 
Part of the increase in waste in 2019 came from Italy, where two factors were mainly responsible for 
the growth in waste produced and disposed of. These were the transfer of the Padua office to Rovigo, 
and the application of the 5s programme, both of which involved the disposal of materials, substances 
and machinery that were no longer necessary. 
Responsible use of water resources  
Water consumption at all SIT offices is monitored and used for industrial production processes, in 
office toilets, canteens, and in changing rooms. In Group facilities, as well as for the usual municipal 
necessities, water consumption is mainly connected to industrial use, such as tumbling processes, to 
eliminate surface burrs from die-cast aluminium objects, and in the cooling of production machinery.

As regards water withdrawal, a fault with a meter on the sampling line at the Rovigo site and its slow 
replacement with a new meter (the responsibility of the water service provider) prevented the Group 
from accurately measuring aqueduct water consumption in 2018 and 2019. It was therefore decided 
to estimate the plant’s consumption for both years, using values from 2017 and, for 2019, adding the 
consumption from the Padua office, which was transferred to Rovigo in late 2018. Following the 
estimates of water used at the Rovigo site, therefore, the figures for 2018 have been restated 
compared  to  those  published  in  the  previous  NFR.  As  for  the  increase  in  consumption  with 
groundwater removal, this is mainly due to an increase in production and operating hours at SIT's 
 
plant in Mexico.
