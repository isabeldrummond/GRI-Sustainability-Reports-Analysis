    SIT S.p.A. – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at  
December 31, 2019 
 
Creation of value for stakeholder 
The economic value generated by the Group, and consequently distributed to stakeholder, derives 
from the calculation of generated and distributed value. This is determined for the reference period 
from the value generated from service and product sales and other income (e.g. financial income, 
other revenues) net of amortisation and write-downs, and from the distributed value, in various 
forms, to Group stakeholder. 
The  calculation  is  based  on  the  income  statement  used  in  the  Group’s  consolidated  financial 
statements at December 31, 2019. 
Thus, in 2019, SIT generated an economic value amounting to Euro 351.360 million, redistributed to 
the communities, personnel, public administrations, suppliers and lenders.
