    SIT S.p.A. â€“ Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at  
December 31, 2019 
Stakeholder engagement 
A rigorous sustainability strategy requires the identification of stakeholder through their relevance to 
the organisation. SIT identified stakeholder categories through an analysis of various companies 
operating in the reference industrial sector. The Group selected stakeholder by considering its 
business activities and social role in the countries in which it operates.  
Significant stakeholders were thus identified to include: shareholders, investors, lenders, customers, 
employees,  consultants,  governments,  public  administrations,  institutions,  regulators,  suppliers, 
subcontractors, commercial partners, trade unions, local communities, wider communities, the 
media,  universities,  research  centres,  and  trade  associations.  Following  identification  of  the 
stakeholder, SIT proceeded to rank them according to their dependence and influence on the Group.
