    SIT S.p.A. – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement at  
December 31, 2019 
In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the Group ensures that plants and equipment containing F-
gases that could accidentally generate greenhouse emissions are correctly operated and maintained 
at all sites.

With regard to the release of pollutants into the atmosphere at the Group’s production sites in Italy 
and Mexico, the overall situation has improved considerably in Italy compared to the previous year. 
This is as a result of shorter operating hours at Rovigo, as well as the precautions described above, 
and the modernisation and optimised management of plants. 
The only exception to the overall improvement seen in Italy is the emissions value for the pollutant 
tetrachloroethylene at the Group's Rovigo plant. This particular figure – which always falls within the 
legal limits (as verified following checks) – is a result of the inefficient functioning of some washing 
systems.  These  machines  have  subsequently  been  replaced  with  better-performing  and/or 
refurbished equipment. 
 
23  For  the  calculation  of  Scope  1  emissions,  the  2019  DEFRA  conversion  factors  were  used 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2019. Moreover, regarding SIT’s emissions, 
the consumption of hydrogen and other mixed gases, such as hydrogenated nitrogen, and mixtures of methane and argon, were not 
considered as they represented a negligible portion of the total. 
24 For the calculation of the Scope 2 - Location Based emissions, the 2015-2016 International Comparisons conversion factors published by 
Terna were used. 
25 For the calculation of the Scope 2 - Market Based emissions, the AIB - European Residual Mixes 2018 conversion factors were used (Vers. 
1.2 of 11/07/2019).
