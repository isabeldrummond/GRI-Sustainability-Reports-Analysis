COMMUNITY 
RELATIONS
In  accordance  with  the  Contship  Italia  mission  –  “we  create  value  for 
our employees and for the communities where we operate” – Contship’s 
subsidiaries are involved in a range of projects focusing on local communities 
through corporate social initiatives.
PORTOLAB
Contship offers primary schools the chance to use the port and the rail 
hubs as innovative workshops to learn about geography, maths, history and 
many other subjects, by looking at trade, vessel routes, yard dimensions, etc. 
The PortoLab project also involves many local-community partners (port 
authorities, customs offices, harbour police, etc.) directly and online at www.
portolab.it with the aim of opening the terminals up to the general public. 
A HAVEN OF ART
Contship  Italia  terminals  regularly  host  local  artists  and  temporary 
exhibitions open to the public.
SPORTIVAMENTE
This project creates interactive relationships between sports clubs, schools 
and Contship subsidiaries.
SCHOOL WORK EXPERIENCE 
This educational project for local high schools seeks to raise the group’s profile 
while strengthening links with local communities. It shares Contship Italia 
Group’s culture and values while providing general and cross-functional skills 
and useful information to introduce students to a potential future career.
