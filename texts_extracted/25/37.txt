The Melzo extension project is a win-
win solution. From a purely productive 
standpoint,  the  capacity  boost  offers 
a timely, efficient response to market 
demand.  And  with  the  mitigation 
and  redevelopment  initiatives,  the 
environmental  benefits  are  clear  not 
only for the local area, but also on a global 
scale, as the rail-transport investment 
has had a major impact in slashing CO

emissions.  Hannibal  and  Oceanogate 
have over 300 railway wagons between 
them, around half of which are fitted with 
low-environmental-impact brake shoes 
for reduced noise and dust emissions. In 
2017, our 5,715 trains travelled 1,110,035 
km and saved around 13,000 tons of CO  
2
emissions.
