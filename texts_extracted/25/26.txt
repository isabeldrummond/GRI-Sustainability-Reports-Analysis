INTERMODAL 
TRANSPORT
With  regard  to  intermodal  transport  provided  to  the  maritime  and 
continental  freight  transportation  sectors,  the  Group  continues  to  grow 
through the development of new services and integration with the network of 
Italy’s main ports and inland terminals.
Hannibal,  Contship’s  intermodal  services  provider  for  maritime  and 
continental transport, reported growth of 11% (+30,000 TEUs transported) and 
achieved increased volumes for the second year running. To meet the strong 
market demand, Hannibal continues to develop new services and increase 
the frequency of existing ones at both the domestic and international levels.
Rail Hub Milano (RHM) is the heart of Contship’s intermodal network 
located east of Milan. It was affected by a major interruption of the Rastatt 
railway line, between Basel and Karlsruhe, in last August. The two-month 
closure of this crucial part of the Rhine-Alps corridor caused a stoppage of rail 
freight traffic between western Europe and Italy. This resulted in a reduction 
of 181 units in the total number of trains handled at the terminal with respect 
to 2016 (-3.0%). In 2017 RHM opened a new rolling stock workshop inside the 
rail hub. This structure, operated by Bombardier, makes it possible to provide 
24 hours assistance to ensure that maintenance and repair operations can be 
carried out with the utmost speed and efficiency.
Oceanogate  Italia,  the  Contship  operator  providing  rail  traction  and 
shunting services, completed its training programme for new staff in 2017. 
This investment is part of a broader strategic plan designed to train new 
resources and expert operators, with a view to increasing the performance of 
the railway system and further expand the network of services.
