MARITIME 
TERMINALS
La Spezia Container Terminal  (LSCT), gateway for southern and central 
Europe, continued to grow, notwithstanding the volatility of the container 
sector in 2017. The Group expects LSCT volumes to continue growing, thus 
consolidating La Spezia’s role as the principal access port for southern 
Europe’s Markets. LSCT gives customers the opportunity to diversify risk and 
inventory costs for container-transported goods, thanks to its integration 
with Hannibal intermodal services. In what was a highly successful year for 
Contship’s biggest terminal, at the 2017 Asian Freight, Logistics and Supply 
Chain Awards the leading international players also voted LSCT as the best 
container terminal in Europe.
Medcenter Container Terminal (MCT), Contship’s principal transhipment 
hub, is located in Gioia Tauro. In spite of the fall in volumes handled, in 2017 
it welcomed another 20,000 TEU container ship, thus confirming its major 
infrastructure role after hosting, in 2016, the biggest container ship ever to 
dock in an Italian port.
Cagliari  International  Container  Terminal  (CICT),  Contship’s 
transhipment hub in Sardinia, remains one of the most important hubs in 
the central Mediterranean with the capacity to provide reliable and highly 
flexible services.
