Sustainability is climbing the top of businesses’ strategic agendas.
Companies acknowledge more than ever before that their mission goes 
beyond their core business to include taking responsibility for the social and 
environmental effects of their activities.
For Contship Italia Group, sustainability has always been a question of 
efficiency - a set of practices and investments in staff training, process 
continuous improvement and economic resources, to be competitive and to 
grow along with the regions and communities where we invest most heavily.
Contship’s first sustainability report is an opportunity to take stock.
We trust that it will give all stakeholders a clearer picture of Contship’s 
diverse initiatives over many years backed by a strong product offering in 
the terminal-container and intermodal-transport arenas, all in pursuit of 
ever more sustainable growth.
Now, 50 years after the group was founded, demand for stevedoring services
is increasingly concentrated on a handful of global operators, and there is a 
need for greater balance between different modes of transport - especially 
road and rail haulage and better supply chain risk management for the 
benefit of the cargo owners.
Strategic challenges like these underline the vital role of an independent and 
private operator like Contship.
Our investments generate opportunities and drive competitiveness in the 
economies, markets and industries that we serve.
We have always championed excellence and innovation through effective 
sustainability practices, which are the key to assuring an ever-improving 
quality of life for future generations. We are guardians of a world that we 
must pass on to them; we are committed to leave it better than we found it.
