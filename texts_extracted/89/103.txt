  The acquisition of goods and services is normally centralized at the Group Procurement, which, 
through competitive and negotiation processes, selects the suppliers based on their knowledge 
and professional capabilities, their organizational solidity and sustainability and the Group’s aim 
to obtain value for money. In particular, the Group is committed to avoiding situations of conflict of 
interest and ensuring selection on the basis of transparent and objective criteria.
  The Group Directive on purchasing processing management and the Purchasing process management 
operating procedure require that suppliers involved in the competitive processes or contracts 
managed by Group Procurement must actually qualify under the qualification guidelines set at 
Group level, furnishing: suitable documentation, earnings/financial data which show they are able 
to supply the good/service concerned, positive earnings results and no negative issues of any kind.
  In order to minimize the risks associated with buying from counterparties which are unreliable or 
which could lead to problems in the future, the Group Procurement unit:
     Enters active or potential suppliers in the Group list of suppliers for every area of expense and  
    the contracts managed by the unit;
     Reviewing information and documents published (DURC, chamber of commerce certificate,  
    financial statements, etc.) to check they are complete and accurate, and carry out not only  
    analysis of the company’s earnings/financial data, but also checks, through external sources,  
    of any negative aspects regarding counterparties;
