The workers’ health and safety risk assessment process has meant that the number of accidents in the 
workplace recorded last year has remained at extremely low levels. The Group is committed to monitoring 
accident statistics and indicators in order to further reduce the occurrence of such instances. During the 
period under review a total of 40 accidents were reported Group-wide, eleven of which in the workplace 
itself (six to men and five to women) and 29 elsewhere (20 men, 29 women), the majority of which (39) in 
Italy. Compared to last year there was a reduction in the number of accidents, in particular those which 
took place off the Group’s premises, due in particular to the reduction in the number of days spent by staff 
at the office during the Covid-19 lockdown period.
