 Management of the company car fleet using criteria that promote respect for the environment. The 
Group’s fleet is comprised of vehicles with low CO2 emissions, latest-generation diesel particulate 
filters (DPFs) and alternative fuels. Virtually all the cars are in line with the Euro 5 and Euro 6 emissions 
standards; hybrid plug-in vehicles have also been included in the grids, the aim being to reach the 
stage where 90% of the company car fleet use hybrid energy, as stated in the Strategic Plan.
The following initiatives have also been implemented:
 Support for electric mobility through installation of five charging stations for electric and plug-in 
hybrid cars at Mediobanca head office and another two stations at the premises of Compass;
 Use of a 100% electric van for the MISposto service and the daily postal services between MIS and the 
other Group companies’ offices.
Energy consumption and the related CO emissions are shown in the table below:

Adjustments made to the data collection process starting from FY 2018-19 have enabled the consumption 
of company cars without fuel cards to be monitored as well. This clearly led to a significant increase in 
consumption levels compared to FY 2017-18.
As for company cars, in FY 2019-20 an increase in the consumption of petrol was recorded, against a 
decrease in the consumption of diesel; this trend is due to the gradual rise in the number of hybrid vehicles 
in the company fleet.
42. For direct energy consumption, where figures are not available estimates have been used: for natural gas in cases involving shared building expenses of which the  
  precise share cannot be calculated, consumption has been estimated on the basis of the floor space in the building actually occupied, or thousandths of the  
  property owned. For bills still to be received, consumption has been estimated based on the previous year’s figures. Data on fuel consumption by company cars  
  which is not available has also been estimated using a similar method.

44. Consumption by Cairn Capital Group Limited not monitored (no details available for consumption by the building at which its offices are located)
45. Data on fuel consumption for CMB is unavailable as fuel consumption is paid directly by the employees with no refund
