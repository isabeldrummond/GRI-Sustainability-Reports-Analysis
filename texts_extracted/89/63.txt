managing stress, conflicts and emotions, and achieving a healthy work-life balance, with targeted 
initiatives to support colleagues who are parents.
During FY 2019-20, a total of 180,758 hours of training were provided, much higher than the 92,141 
hours in the previous year, of which 56% to white collars, 38% to middle management, and 6% to 
management. The main increase in training hours was in the white collars’ category. Management 
and specialist training courses are classroom-based, whereas the compulsory courses and language 
lessons are provided via e-learning activities. Following the outbreak of Covid-19, training activities were 
carried out online. The activities themselves involved, among other things, training in compliance and 
regulation (72%), health and safety (11%), specialist training (5%) and language learning (5%).
In the area of compulsory training, the Group has run courses in the twelve months intended to 
strengthen and embed a culture of health and safety and risk awareness in the workplace and to 
promote responsible behaviour by staff, for a total of 19,542 hours’ training.. 
Training was also provided during the year under review on compulsory issues, such as data privacy, 
anti-corruption,  anti-money-laundering,  data  protection,  market  abuse,  information  security  and 
business continuity.
The significant increase in the number of hours’ training compared to last year is due chiefly to the 
larger number of initiatives run during the lockdown period, plus the new mandatory courses on MiFID 
II, IVASS19 and the revised version of the organizational model instituted pursuant to Italian Legislative 
Decree 231, as well as to new types of course being provided. The inclusion of Mediobanca SGR and the 
Private Banking division in the scope of reporting for this year is also relevant in this connection.
