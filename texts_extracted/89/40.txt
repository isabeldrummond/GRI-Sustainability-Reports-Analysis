corporate governance. The Code of Ethics contains references and guidance which complements the 
legal requirements and self-regulation obligations, with a view to ensuring that behaviour is consistent 
and compliant with the Group’s mission and its fundamental values.
  The Code of Ethics lays down principles, models and regulations in terms of behaviour which the 
Group undertakes to pursue in all its businesses:
    Fairness and honesty
    Impartiality
    Professionalism and valorization of staff
    Confidentiality
    Conflicts of interest
    Transparency and full disclosure of information
    Health and safety
    Environment
    Copyright and intellectual property
    Use of company assets
  The principles and provisions of the Code are binding for Directors, Statutory Auditors, management, 
staff and collaborators of the Group, and also apply to individuals or entities with which the Group 
enters into supply or advisory agreements.
  The administrative and management units and their various divisions undertake to circulate the Code 
of ethics and promote its observance. In particular, each recipient is obliged to:
    Refrain from behaviour which is contrary to the Code and to comply with the company’s body of  
  regulations;
    Direct, wherever possible, their own collaborators to comply scrupulously with the Code;
    Circulate the Code to third parties with which the Group companies enter into a relationship.
 Code of Conduct
  The Code of Conduct is the document which, along with the Code of Ethics, sets out the fundamental 
principles on which the company’s reputation is based, and contains the values which underlie its 
everyday operations, also describing the standard of conduct required of all Mediobanca’s staff and 
collaborators. The Code, which is approved by the Board of Directors, was revised in February 2020.
  All the Bank’s staff members and collaborators, including providers and consultants (jointly, the 
“recipients”) must familiarize themselves with the Code of Conduct and ensure their behaviour is 
based on the principles and values set forth in it. The Recipients must also:
    Comply with the external and internal regulations applicable to their activities and role;
    Complete the training initiatives which the Bank organizes on relevant regulations;
