  In performing its activities the Group pursues the objective of combining profitability and 
competitiveness with scrupulous business ethics, based on principles of honesty, professionalism, 
transparency and fairness towards its clients. 
  Clients are furnished with clear and exhaustive disclosure on the products and services being 
offered to them, and on the terms and conditions being applied, to facilitate comprehension and 
enable them to make informed choices. Any complaints are treated as an opportunity to improve, 
resolve conflict and increase customer trust and satisfaction.
  The approach to conduct risk is intended to identify the principles necessary to ensure correct 
conduct in the performance of the Group’s business, thereby minimizing the risk of the behaviour of 
its employees, while complying with the letter of the regulations, and so causing damage, whether 
actual or potential, to its clients.
  Despite the lack of specific obligations in this area, the Mediobanca Group has adopted a business 
conduct policy, applying the principles defined at international level to the Group’s own areas of 
operation, and developing an approach based on compliance with conduct principles and the 
related concept of conduct risk, defined as the risk facing institutions of incurring losses, current 
or future, as a result of the improper provision of financial services, possibly related to instances of 
wilful misconduct or fraud.
  According to the Business Index on Transparency 2019, the index that analyses the transparency 
of the 100 largest Italian companies and their commitment to transparency in their own anti-
corruption practices and policies, Mediobanca is one of only three companies with a good level of 
transparency and is included in category B.
