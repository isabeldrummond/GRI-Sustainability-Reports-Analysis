The increase in the supply of electricity from renewable sources has generated a reduction in Scope 2 
market-based emissions. The Group also reported a substantial decrease in Scope 3 emissions due to the 
lockdown following the Covid-19 pandemic, the main reduction regarding air travel.
The Group has recorded the following emission levels for ozone-depleting substances: 40 kg of ODS (28 kg 
of which R-410A)52, 786 kg of nitrogen oxides, and 27 kg of sulphur oxides53. NOx and SO emissions were 
2
lower than last year, following the reduction in consumption of electricity from non-renewable sources.
49. For direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions (Scope 2) and company cars (Scope 3), we have used the emission factors recommended in the “Guidelines  
  on application of GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) environmental indicators in banks” released by the Italian banking association (ABI) and compiled in the Italian  
  Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2015 – National Inventory Report 2017 – by ISPRA (Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale). For direct  
  emissions deriving from air and train travel, we have used the emissions factors recommended in the ABI guidelines compiled respectively by the ICAO  
  (International Civil Aviation Organization) and the UIC (Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer) via Ecopassenger.
50.  The indirect CO emissions figures (Scope 2) have been restated from those published in the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement for FY 2018-19, following the  
2
  changes to the consumption of electricity and thermal energy
51. For indirect emissions (Scope 3), estimates have been used in cases where no data was available for recent months, based on the consumption figures recorded  
  in the months prior to that
52. Refrigerant gas used for air conditioning systems: these are refills made during the year following maintenance work
53. NOx and SOx emissions are calculated on the basis of gas, diesel, GPL and energy from non-renewable sources in accordance with the guidelines issued by ABI. The  
  company car fleet is never included in the calculation
