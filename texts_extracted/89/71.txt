personally.
A second engagement analysis was conducted in 2019, to collect opinions on the activities implemented 
following the first survey.
The engagement methods used were the same as the ones used in 2017, and the same external consultancy 
company was used too. An online questionnaire was distributed, with responses received from over 77% 
of staff, and different focus groups were set up to explore the issues raised at the listening stage in more 
depth.
The responses show that the work done by Group HR in the areas of communication and training has 
been appreciated; as have the company volunteering schemes, in which all the Group companies have 
participated enthusiastically.
The survey was also useful in order to establish the priorities to be worked on in the next two years. 
The aim will be to improve staff well-being by working on a variety of initiatives to support the life-work 
balance.
