MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT COLLARS
The career advancement process works closely together with the staff assessment process. Professional 
development decisions for staff may take the form of covering new organizational roles, moving to a 
new contractual level or being assigned a new corporate title, based on experience acquired and results 
achieved. Balance between genders is pursued in the career progression process, with equal access 
guaranteed to roles of responsibility and/or with managerial content, and with the intention where 
possible of bridging any gaps in terms of gender representation among the most senior employees 
in the various organizational units, in cases where candidates have the same skills, qualifications and 
abilities.
The promotion process includes a phase where the candidate is proposed by the head of the 
organizational unit to which they belong, which is then agreed with the relevant HR unit, and final 
approval is granted, with the involvement of the Group General Manager and/or Chief Executive Officer 
for management personnel.
For the highest levels (management or equivalent), the process involves specific assessment of the 
candidate by other senior Bank staff members with different professional backgrounds, experience and 
roles; the promotion must also be consistent with the management succession planning adopted.

The remuneration system is structured so as to attract, motivate and valorize staff with the professional 
qualities required by the Groupâ€™s business. The system is based on principles of fairness, equal 
opportunities and meritocracy. Group HR is responsible for defining the remuneration and employee 
benefit policies, co-ordinating staff selection, recruitment and development via processes which are 
able to leverage and retain talent, increasing their sense of belonging to the Group and guaranteeing 
flexibility and timeliness in covering key roles.
