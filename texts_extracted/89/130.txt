  All A4 paper consumed for office purposes is FSC-certified, and part of the paper consumption 
for commercial purposes uses recycled paper. The reduction in paper consumption in FY 2019-20 
is primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as to digitalization initiatives, such as the one 
implemented for IPOs by the London branch office which has digitalized the procedure.
  During the financial year, the data on waste collected in Italy refers chiefly to toner, quantified 
at approximately 8.36 tons, slightly higher than the figure reported last year64. There was also a 
reduction in the amount of non-dangerous waste produced, attributable to Covid-19 but also the 
awareness-raising campaigns undertaken.
62. This brand distinguishes products and services with reduced environmental impact throughout their lifecycle, thus helping to protect the environment by reducing  
  the quantity of waste and pollution, energy and water consumption, and reducing or eliminating the use of dangerous chemical substances
63. For paper consumption, estimates have been used where data for recent months is unavailable, basing the estimates on the consumption figures recorded in the  
  months prior to that
64. The increase in the consumption of toner against a reduction in the amount of paper used is due to the fact that the reporting is based on toner acquired rather  
  than actually used
