  Relations with suppliers are conducted based on principles of fairness and integrity, and suppliers 
are reminded of the need to do business according to standards of conduct which are consistent 
with those set down in the Group’s Code of Ethics. All suppliers involved in competitive processes 
are required to comply with the:
     Regulations protecting the rights of workers employed in the provision of their services and in  
    particular the collective labour contracts for the relevant sectors;
     Provisions in respect of social security, accident prevention and security, and with the specific  
    regulations in force on the subject of health and safety in the workplace;
     The principles set down in the Group’s Code of Ethics when an order is transmitted or a contract  
    executed.
  To this end, suppliers newly registered in the Group’s list of suppliers must sign a declaration 
confirming that their staff members are treated without distinction and/or discrimination (in 
terms of policy, religion, etc.), that they reject forced and child labour, condemn every form of 
harassment, and guarantee decent working conditions for all their employees. Counterparties 
which do not accept the Mediobanca Group Code of Ethics and refuse to sign the above declaration 
are accordingly excluded from the Group’s supply chain.
  All suppliers managed by the Group Procurement unit are also asked to ensure as follows by means 
of a declaration:
  “that all its staff are treated without distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference, whether direct or 
indirect, based on their: age, gender, sexual orientation, civil status, religion, language, ethnic or national 
origins, physical or mental disabilities, state of pregnancy, maternity or paternity (including as a result of 
adoption), personal convictions, political opinions, and/or trade union affiliation or activities. The company 
also guarantees respect for diversity and non-discrimination at every stage of each employee’s working 
experience; it also safeguards the right and freedom of association and collective bargaining, rejects forced 
labour and child labour and any time of harassment, whether physical, verbal, sexual or psychological, abuse, 
threatening or intimidatory behaviour in the workplace, guaranteeing working conditions which are respectful 
and favourable for its staff, including for issues relating to payment. The company also declares that it will 
monitor its own sub-contractors with respect to compliance with the above requisites.”
