COVID-19 EMERGENCY
Coronavirus, Mediobanca’s solution: internal structure and close relations with clients.
The Mediobanca Group, with its strong governance structure and a solid, effective technology 
platform, has adapted rapidly to the new ways of working remotely imposed by circumstances.
Technology has allowed the Group’s staff to work in safety from home, without having to 
interrupt the service offered to our clients both in the branch offices themselves and through 
remote channels
To manage the emergency, when the first hotspot emerged on 28 February 2020, Mediobanca 
promptly established a Crisis Unit with the aim of adapting the Group’s operations to align with 
the decree laws issued, taking steps to adopt all restrictions imposed by the institutions, and 
updating staff promptly through dedicated newsletters. 
Much attention was also paid to the Group’s local communities and their institutions. In the 
course of the emergency, first the healthcare crisis itself followed by the social and economic 
crises, the Group has donated over €2.6m to entities, institutions and associations involved in 
the fight against Covid-19.
The various initiatives implemented by the Group are described in more detail in the following 
sections.
