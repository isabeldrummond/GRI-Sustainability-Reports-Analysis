The injury rate is the ratio of the number of injuries reported to the number of hours worked 
(including overtime), multiplied by 200,000. The high consequence injury rate is the ratio of the 
number of injuries with high consequence reported to the number of hours worked (including 
overtime), multiplied by 200,000. Worked hours of some affiliates have been estimated. 
High consequence injuries are the one that results in an injury from which the worker cannot, 
does not, or is not expected to recover fully to pre-injury health status within 6 months.
