Value Chain
At Chiesi we refer to the global value chain as all the activities and the actors 
involved in the life cycle of our products; from R&D to production, distribution 
and eventually disposal. Reforming value chains in a truly sustainable manner 
is, for us, a topic of the highest importance. Yet, it is in this area especially, with 
the involvement of so many third parties, that sustainability faces great imple-
mentation challenges while also presenting opportunities to be spread across 
the business.
Through our Global Value Chain we commit to producing one over-arching po-
sitive effect:
— Taking a leading role towards a sustainable value chain 
to ensure that this commitment is secured throughout the years to come, we 
made Chiesi a Benefit Corporation and inserted into our Statute this specific 
purpose of common benefit: 
“Promoting a conscious and sustainable way of operating in the business, inclu-
ding the fostering of collaborative dialogue among stakeholders”.
