and Patients
At Chiesi, we refer to products and patients as the end results of all of the com-
pany’s production processes, and the people that benefit from them. Products 
and patients are closely intertwined. Our product lines are expressions of our 
mission, improving the life of patients, our main stakeholders. The centrality 
of the person, the patient, is the distinctive trait of our approach and it is con-
cretised in this area.
Our commitment in this field aims to determine two positive effects:
— Improving patients’ health
— Fostering Research & Development and substantially contributing to the
    scientific progress
To ensure that these commitments are secured throughout the years to come, 
we made Chiesi a Benefit Corporation and inserted into our Statute this speci-
fic purpose of common benefit:
“The positive impact on people and patients, with the aim of improving their 
health, well-being and quality of life”
