r
— Our business model is not specifically designed to promote decent work and  t
n
o
economic growth. Chiesi’s commitment results in the alignment of our social  c
s 
i’
and environmental performance throughout our practices and processes to ad- s
e
i
h
dress SDG 8 targets. C
— In the evaluation process of Internal Operations, we resulted in having a 
strong commitment in ensuring working conditions that respect Labour rights. 
Our operations are focused on monitoring and improving worker satisfaction / 
engagement and on transparency (i.e. in ensuring access to information).
— For the supply chain, the analysis confirmed improvement opportunities in the 
topics of social and environmental impact of our suppliers and in the spending on 
local providers. With regard to this last point, we are aware that further improve-
ment is limited by the impossibility to refer to local suppliers in our specific sector.
— Our policy making strategy does not include any initiatives specifically desi-
gned to advocate for policy changes to contribute to SDG 8 (either at individual 
or collective level).
 
— Chiesi shows a low level of risk in negatively affecting or inhibiting SDG 8.
