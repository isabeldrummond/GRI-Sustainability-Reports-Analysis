Chiesi’s core mission is to provide excellent healthcare to our patients  u
d
o
and to improve the quality of human lives. This is what drives us as a  r
t
n
pharmaceutical company and will always be at the heart of our operations. We  n i
A
acknowledge that times have changed since our establishment in 1935, and 
that businesses have a relevant role in the current scenario with their ability 
to impact the world and the society. Today’s world is facing unprecedented 
challenges that require new behaviours, new practices, and new mindsets in 
order to shape smart and human solutions. For this reason, we feel the duty 
to transparently assess and communicate the impact of our company, both 
in terms of creating positive value and in terms of the challenges that we 
face as a business operating in this interconnected system.
The world of business, called to take an active role in working towards 
those solutions, is responding. There is an ongoing conversation on how 
companies should behave and what their role should be beyond liability. 
Business ethics are debated as the very foundation of success.
For the first time in history, reputable actors and specialized press urged 
the business sector to do its part to reset capitalism which has by now 
proven to be insufficient to face the new global scenarios.
There is a cultural shift taking place, moving the economy away from the 
old “shareholder capitalism” interpretation, where generating profit for the 
shareholders is at the core, towards a “stakeholder capitalism”, able to cultivate 
prosperity for all, from people to planet. 
As humans, we are moving from the short sighted and profit focused 
system towards a renewed and more human economic and social paradigm. 
This new mindset is already circulating in the corporate world, as well as 
in universities and academia where future entrepreneurs are nurtured.
