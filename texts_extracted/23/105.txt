— Our internal operations are on the right trajectory but with important steps yet 
to be taken. We need to encourage the purchase of energy from low-impact re-
newable sources. Our achievements in lowering the carbon intensity for Scope 
1 and 2 were rewarded, together with the recognition of the progress made in 
managing Scope 3. Our pledge to meet carbon neutrality by 2035 has undoubtedly 
contributed to this result and represents the starting point to align all strategic 
directions to one main objective.
Scope 3 includes the management of greenhouse gas emissions produced by 
the supply chain, therefore our 2035 plan will ensure further steps are taken in 
tracking and managing our suppliers CO emissions.

— Our policy making strategy does not include any initiatives specifically designed 
to advocate for policy changes to contribute to SDG 13 (either at individual or 
collective level).
