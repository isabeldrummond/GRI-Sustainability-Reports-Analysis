GHG Protocol definition: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions come from sources (physical units or 
processes that release GHG into the atmosphere) that are owned or controlled by the organi-
sation. Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions include, but are not limited to, the CO2 emissions from 
the fuel consumption. Energy Indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions result from the generation of 
purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed by the organisation. 
Methodology:
Scope 1 emission coefficient data for natural gas, diesel, gasoline, bioethanol and LPG were 
calculated using DEFRA (Department for Environment Food Rural Affairs,
UK, 2019) data as source for emission factors (expressed in tCO2 equivalent).
The GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, in accordance with the GHG Protocol, include two 
methodologies for calculating Scope 2 emissions, the “Location-based” approach and the “Mar-
ket-based” approach. The “Location-based” approach provides for the use of a national average 
emission factor related to the specific national energy mix for the production of electricity (Sour-
ce: Terna, Confronti Internazionali 2016). The “Market-based” approach contemplates the use 
of an emission factor defined on a contractual basis with the electricity supplier. Given the pre-
sence of specific contractual agreements between some Affiliates of the Group and the electri-
city supplier (purchase of certificates of Guarantee of Origin), this approach foresees the use of 
the emission actors relating to the national “residual mix”, without considering that electricity 
purchased from renewable sources (Source: Association of Issuing Bodies, European Residual 
Mixes 2018). When the “residual mix” emission factors is not available (for countries outside the 
EU), the factor of location based method has been used.
Scope 2 emissions are expressed in tCO2 , the amount of CH4 and NO2 (percentage) has a not 
significant effect on the overall GHG emissions (CO2e) as deductible from technical literature.
Scope 3 emissions include emissions from employees’ own private vehicles used for commer-
cial activities, business travels (only for Italy - Chiesi Farmaceutici, Brazil, France, Germany, Mexi-
co, Netherlands, UK and USA) and primary logistics. Emission coefficient data were calculated 
using DEFRA (Department for Environment Food Rural Affairs, UK, 2019).
