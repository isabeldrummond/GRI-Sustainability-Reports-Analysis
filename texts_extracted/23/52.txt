8GHG Protocol definition: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions come from sources (physical 
units or processes that release GHG into the atmosphere) that are owned or controlled by 
the organisation. Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions include, but are not limited to, the CO2 
emissions from the fuel consumption. Energy Indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions result 
from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam con-
sumed by the organisation. Details on methodology and conversation factors are explai-
ned in the Annexes (p. 142)
While we are currently developing an analysis of the perimeter of the scope 3 
emissions, material to our business model, we have started to measure some of 
our scope 3 emissions within our current capacity.
Scope 3 already measured:
Emissions from Primary logistics9: 4,005 tonnes CO

Emissions from Business Travels10: 8,717 tonnes CO
