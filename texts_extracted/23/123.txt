Appendix: What is a Benefit 
Corporation and what 
is a B Corp
The Benefit Corporation, known in Italy as Società Benefit, represents one of the 
most advanced models in terms of positive corporate, social and environmental 
impact. They are for-profit companies that express a dual objective to the 
corporate purpose: to create value for both shareholders and stakeholders. 
Together they constitute a global movement of 'Purpose Driven Businesses' that 
aims to spread a more evolved economic paradigm which sees companies as 
protagonists in regenerating society and the biosphere. The Vision is to trigger 
positive competition between all companies, so that they are measured and 
evaluated in their actions according to the same standard: the positive impact 
on society and the planet, as well as economic results.
Since 2016, Italy has been the first sovereign state in the world and the first 
country after the United States to introduce Benefit Corporations, a new legal 
form of enterprise, which provides a solid basis for aligning and protecting the 
company's mission, as well as creating shared value in the long term.  
Benefit Corporations choose to: 
— make explicit in their articles of incorporation the purpose for which the 
company exists and to balance the interests of shareholders with those of all 
other stakeholders
— fully measure all of their impacts and communicate them transparently through 
an impact report, which integrates with the company's traditional reporting
