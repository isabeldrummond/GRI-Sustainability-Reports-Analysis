Citizenship
Corporate Citizenship is the recognition that a corporation has economic, so-
cial, cultural and environmental responsibilities to the community in which it 
seeks a licence to operate. Such as any citizenship, it is made up of rights and 
duties. Inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we de-
veloped our Corporate Citizenship through internal corporate governance practi-
ces in place within our company. 
Through our Corporate Citizenship we commit to achieving several positive effects:
— Having a positive impact on the territory
— Increasing the transparency and ethical practices of business
— Actively and positively contributing to European and international Agenda
To ensure that these commitments are secured through the years to come, we 
made Chiesi a Benefit Corporation and inserted in our Statute this specific pur-
pose of common benefit:
“The contribution to the development of the local communities in which the 
company operates.”
