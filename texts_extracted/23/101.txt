performance throughout our practices and processes to address SDG 9 targets.
— The assessment for the category ‘Internal Operations’ has fully recognised 
Chiesi’s point of excellence in R&D and our commitment to promoting the use 
of technology for research innovation. Furthermore, our Environmental Manage-
ment System and water conservation practices were highlighted as strengths. 
Chiesi’s performance could improve in conservation and in the percentage of 
company facilities certified accordingly to Green Building Standards.
— The analysis has rewarded our contribution in R&D and technology with our 
suppliers. Investment in local and Small and medium-sized enterprises sup-
pliers remains low, reflecting a characteristic of our industry.
— Our policy making strategy does not include any initiatives specifically desi-
gned to advocate for policy changes to contribute to SDG 9 (either at individual 
or collective level). 
— Chiesi shows a low level of risk in negatively affecting or inhibiting SDG 9.
