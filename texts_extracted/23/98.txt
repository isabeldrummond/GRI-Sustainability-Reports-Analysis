— For the Internal operations area, which includes practices that promote SDG 3  C
within our own facilities, we are pleased to have achieved the highest possible 
score, which reflects our efforts in this direction. This includes, for example, the 
supplementary health benefits and wellness initiatives we have implemented 
for our people
 
— We should reinforce the assessment criteria and guidelines put in place with 
our suppliers to further encourage healthcare and operational health and safety 
development on their side
— Although we have specific activities to advocate for positive regulatory chan-
ges, we are suggested to improve our collaboration with stakeholders to impro-
ve behaviour or performance specifically related to achieving SDG 3
