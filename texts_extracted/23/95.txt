Our commitment to SDGs stems from a deep sense of responsibility about our  s

impact and, at the same time, an important awareness of the role of business  i

in fostering the transition to a long-term sustainable economic system.
The strength of business is an essential element and driving force for the 
achievement of SDGs, but so far this drive has been held back by the lack of 
shared tools to guide and support companies towards internal reflection and 
specific, meaningful actions. 
The need to bridge this gap led to a solid partnership in 2017 between the UN 
Global Compact (UNGC) - the UN agency responsible for guiding and suppor-
ting the global business community in advancing UN goals and values through 
responsible corporate practices - and B Lab - the US based non-profit organi-
sation that develops B Corp’s measurement tools and encourages their wor-
ldwide diffusion. In a collaboration that has lasted more than two years, the 
two actors have put together, on the one hand, the great institutional reach, 
content expertise and global extension of the UNGC and, on the other hand, 
the robustness, innovativeness and accuracy of a platform for measuring im-
pacts such as the B Impact Assessment by B Lab.
