At Chiesi, we refer to processes as the sum of all productive operations as well 
as those which ensure the continued functioning of the Chiesi business, inclu-
ding decision-making procedures and internal company practices, having an im-
pact on employees, and the biosphere.
Through our Processes we commit to having several positive effects:
— Ensuring regular supply of high-quality medicinal products
    for the patients in need
— Lowering our impact on the biosphere
— Fostering the self-fulfilment and wellbeing of the Chiesi people
— Guaranteeing a safe and healthy working place for our employees
Ensuring the supply of high-quality medicinal products for the needs of our pa-
tients represents our core business, achieved through a combination of many 
actions performed across the entire organisation, therefore the whole report will 
describe this item. In this chapter we will focus on the last three positive effects 
regarding the way we care about our employees’ health, safety and well-being 
and the environmental issues related to our processes.
To ensure that this commitment is secured through the years to come, we made 
Chiesi a Benefit Corporation and inserted into our Statute this specific purpose 
of common benefit: 
“Continuous innovation towards the sustainability of processes and all the com-
pany practices so to minimise negative impacts, in favour of positive ones, on 
people, biosphere, and on the territory.”
