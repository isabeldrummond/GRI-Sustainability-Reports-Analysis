— For the internal operations area, we discovered that we have a solid perfor-
mance in all of the evaluation topics, such as women’s representation in the wor-
kforce and management, gender discrimination management. At the same time, 
we are aware that we have further steps to take to address the pay gap issue.
— Our Suppliers Code of Interdependence, with provisions about gender equality 
and non-discrimination, along with the procurement policy that gives preference 
to women-owned businesses, are recognised as good practices that contribute 
to SDG 5.
— Our policy making strategy does not include any initiatives specifically desi-
gned to advocate for policy changes to contribute to SDG 5 (either at individual 
or collective level).
 
— Chiesi shows a low level of risk in negatively affecting or inhibiting SDG 5.
