Note: The Group will carry out an analysis concerning the relevance of workers who are not 
employees, in order to consider the possibility to gather data from the employers of workers 
who are not employees and the suppliers who work in the Group’s plants and/or the control of 
the Group, taking into consideration the quality and the accuracy of those data over which the 
Group has no direct control.
