— Chiesi improved access to high quality jobs and green spaces for the surrounding 
communities: our” Green Km” initiative is just one example. Moreover, we strengthe-
ned and safeguarded the cultural and natural heritage assets in the city of Parma 
with specific initiatives, such as ‘Parma, Io Ci Sto!’ and supporting Parma’s candidacy 
as EU Green Capital. We also put in place specific practices to reduce carbon emis-
sions from transportation, hence reducing the carbon footprint caused by travel /
commuting. Although we are heading the right direction, there are still some areas 
that can be improved. One possible action to this effect would be encouraging the 
use of sustainable transport with Chiesi employees and fostering the implementa-
tion of programs regarding waste management and indoor air quality checks.
— Chiesi’s supply chain contribution on SDG 11 has achieved a satisfactory result, 
but we know it’s only a starting point and we are continuing to work to reduce carbon 
emissions related to transportation, in line with the objective of carbon neutrality.
— We have specific activities to advocate for policy changes in our local community 
to contribute to SDG 11 (either at individual or collective level).
— Chiesi shows a low level of risk in negatively affecting or inhibiting SDG 11.
